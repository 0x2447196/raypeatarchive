00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.200
 Today's guest is a researcher and expert in the area of female hormones and he received

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.040
 his doctorate in philosophy and endocrine physiology and biochemistry from the University

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.080
 of Oregon in 1972.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.840
 He has taught courses in endocrinology, physiology, the brain, and aging at such schools as the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.120
 National College of Naturopathic Medicine and the University of Oregon.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.080
 He is the author of several books, all of which I have read myself, which include progesterone

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.560
 and orthomolecular medicine and nutrition for women, mind and tissue.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.560
 He also has a monthly newsletter which he's been writing since 1980 and to which I also

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.560
 subscribe.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.280
 His name is Dr. Ray Peat and we'd like to welcome him to the program.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.840
 Dr. Peat, welcome.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 Nice to have you with us.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.800
 You're there in Eugene, Oregon, isn't that correct?

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.560
 We're here in Las Vegas where the weather is sunny and still a little warm for this

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.440
 time of year and you're there where it's overcast.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.360
 I used to live there for 15 years so I know exactly what it's like.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.360
 It's raining.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.920
 Raining or drizzling because everybody walks around there without an umbrella.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.840
 They're so used to it, you know, the light drizzle.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.640
 And when it's overcast so much of the time, do you see or are you familiar with much seasonal

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.680
 affective disorder where people become depressed because they're not getting enough sunlight?

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.680
 Oh yeah.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.520
 About 25 years ago when I moved to Eugene from Southern Oregon where there's a lot more

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.720
 sun, I wondered why I was feeling lethargic and depressed and I realized we hadn't had

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.280
 a day of sunlight for about two months straight and that was when I really started getting

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.840
 interested in the hormonal effects of sunlight.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.320
 And when I moved back after being in Mexico for several years, I moved back to Eugene

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.240
 and started seeing graduate student young women who had moved to Eugene and immediately

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.160
 started having hormonal problems, EMS and worse symptoms.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.960
 What did you do for yourself to correct that problem?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.760
 Trying to get as much sunlight as possible but when there's no sunlight then I keep a

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.000
 couple of, they call them infrared bulbs but they're farmers use them for brooder lamps

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 to keep baby chicks warm and so on.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.640
 They have a clear front and a reflector built in but they have a warmer temperature, lower

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.080
 temperature than the usual incandescent bulb and that means that the light penetrates more

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.080
 deeply.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.560
 It's rich in red and orange frequencies and I keep about 500 watts shining down on me

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.800
 all the time when I'm indoors.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.740
 Yeah, that sounds like a very interesting approach similar to the infrared sauna which

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.120
 can penetrate deeper without having to overheat the patient.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.760
 What about using ultraviolet light?

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.600
 Isn't that also a treatment?

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.480
 Yeah, I have about an 80-year-old mercury vapor lamp that I use for getting extra vitamin

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.040
 D once in a while but I also take vitamin D. I like to take it through my skin because

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.760
 I never have much confidence in how pure the excipients are in supplements.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.480
 Taking it through my skin, it works fine for keeping my vitamin D up.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.320
 Yeah, we have the same concern in our clinic about using the best quality supplements because

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.000
 a lot of products out there, especially the ones made by the pharmaceutical company which

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.920
 are very cheap but very ineffective and so patients read about the great results that

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.160
 you can get from taking certain B vitamins or vitamin E or amino acid and then they go

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.920
 buy it on the cheap and wonder why they're not getting results.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.240
 30 years ago, I was doing a lot of counseling with allergic people.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.680
 In the summer, Eugene is near a big grass growing area and at the end of the summer,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.520
 they burn the fields and release a lot of chemicals into the air so the asthma sickness

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.000
 rate is very high.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.600
 All summer, there are lots of allergic people in Eugene and I found at first that giving

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.960
 them supplements and a good diet, especially rich in vitamin A and pandenthalic acid took

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.760
 care of a big part of the population with allergies but there were many that didn't

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.840
 improve and I found that if I got them to use natural foods and avoid all of their supplements,

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.600
 all of them improved and it turned out that many, many people taking a lot of vitamin

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.600
 mineral supplements every day were actually allergic to the excipients in the products.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.440
 Yeah, that's a good point.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.880
 What happens in the patient, our experience is that patients have a threshold and when

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.200
 they are exposing themselves to allergens, whether in their food or in the air or even

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.520
 from their supplements in this case, they all add up.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.480
 They have a cumulative effect and then you reach that threshold at which they're reactive

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:26.880
 and sometimes lowering their reactivity to one of those agents may help lower their response,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.820
 their allergens but the allergy is still there until they're neutralized and you're able

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.200
 to identify what they are and eliminate them completely.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.200
 All they've done is...

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.840
 The total burden and the amount of energy you have to deal with the burden is what produces

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.160
 symptoms.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.320
 If your blood sugar is low, almost anything becomes a serious allergen.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.720
 With animal experiments, they found that the weakest allergen, if they lowered the blood

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.840
 sugar with insulin, the animals would die in shock from a very weak allergen but if

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.920
 they gave them extra sugar, even the allergic animals could...

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.240
 They would get nothing but mild sniffles from a deadly super strong allergen.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.240
 Now, what about hypoglycemia or reactive hypoglycemia?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.680
 Patients are eating something that's raising their blood sugar and then it drops over a

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.960
 short period of time.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.960
 Are those patients then...

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.440
 Are these are patients that are more susceptible to allergies or that are reacting in an allergic

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.440
 way?

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:32.080
 It can become a vicious circle because normally when you are exposed to a stress or an allergen,

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.560
 you put out a little extra cortisol to improve your immunity and lower your inflammation.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.120
 That can start suppressing your thyroid function and lowering your liver's detoxifying ability

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.600
 and your intestine always has allergens in it and especially if you're exposed to some

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.120
 special allergens, the chronic exposure to cortisol, suppressing your liver function

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.760
 and thyroid function allows those toxins and allergens from your intestine to get into

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:12.220
 the bloodstream and endotoxin is a basic substance produced by bacteria in the intestine and

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:20.200
 that poisons our energy-producing systems, almost turns off mitochondrial function and

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:27.320
 that wastes the blood sugar so that you can create hypoglycemia by exposing yourself to

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.920
 too many of these stresses.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:36.420
 The quickest way to break out of the cycle is to eat a well-balanced natural diet but

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.240
 emphasizing a lot of fruits.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.760
 Orange juice for example because of the high potassium content which lets you handle and

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.480
 absorb blood sugar without disturbing your insulin.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:54.560
 The potassium itself handles the sugar without triggering the insulin and when your liver

00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:00.800
 is receiving enough sugar from the combination of potassium and sugar in the fruit, it is

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:07.000
 able to activate the thyroid hormone restoring the poisoned function of your mitochondria

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.360
 and letting you use oxygen efficiently so it can bring you out of a chronic allergic

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:18.440
 hypoglycemic state and get you back to a steady blood sugar sometimes just in a day or two

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.200
 I think you mentioned a couple of things that most people are not aware of.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.680
 Number one is that orange juice has potassium in it.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.160
 Everybody thinks about eating bananas but if you're low in potassium you can drink orange

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.040
 juice and get it increased much quicker.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:35.740
 You also mentioned something about the liver which is an area where the thyroid is converted

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.640
 from inactive to active form.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.640
 Most people don't understand.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.160
 Yeah, Bruno Barnes many years ago wrote a very good book called "Hypoglycemia, It's

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.840
 Your Liver Not Your Mind" and he was one of the first people to emphasize that most of

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:57.080
 the active thyroid, about 70% of it is produced in your liver rather than in the thyroid gland.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.240
 The gland itself in your neck produces about 30% of the active hormone.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:08.200
 Anytime your blood sugar falls, if you go without eating for eight hours for example,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:14.520
 your blood sugar is likely to fall and that your liver doesn't want to convert your tissues

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:20.840
 to food and so your liver stops making thyroid so your metabolism decreases.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:26.240
 Your temperature goes down at some point when you have stopped eating so that you don't

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.240
 burn up your body too fast as you would if your metabolic rate stayed high without eating.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.720
 Yeah, now we mentioned that the thyroid is produced by the thyroid, it's also produced

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.400
 by the liver and we're converted there.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.120
 Doesn't that conversion also take place at the cellular level as well?

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.720
 Well, the tissues produce quite a bit of it.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.120
 The pituitary gland can detect T4 because of the inactive form of the thyroid, thyroxine

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:56.640
 and since it can convert it, it doesn't distinguish very strongly between whether you're taking

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.680
 T4 or T3.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:05.520
 It turns off its activity whenever it sees T4 or T3 and so since it produces just a tiny

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.920
 amount for its own detecting purposes, if you accumulate too much thyroxine in your

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:18.640
 tissues, pituitary thinks you have enough thyroid but your liver not be producing any

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.520
 active thyroid hormone from it at all.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:27.880
 In one of the early experiments studying where the hormone is active and what it's doing,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.100
 they took slices of the different organs and added thyroxine.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:38.040
 They found that liver became fully activated with a modest amount of thyroxine added.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:43.560
 The kidneys converted a little of it and were slightly activated by thyroxine.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:49.480
 The muscles were not activated at all but the brain when thyroxine was added was actually

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:56.960
 suppressed because brain normally has an extremely high concentration of the active T3 part of

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:05.240
 the hormone in relation to T4 and so locally, the too much T4 affects your brain in an anti-thyroid

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:11.240
 direction but very few doctors are aware of the risks of prescribing plain thyroxine.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.800
 That's a good point, a very good point.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.240
 We're going to talk about that more when we come back from the break.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.240

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:35.720
 Dr. Peeb, you mentioned that thyroxin has a suppressive effect on the brain.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.040
 I think it's important that we discuss that in a little more detail because the audience

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.760
 may not understand that thyroxin is T4 which is the same thing as synthroid which means

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.400
 the most common thyroid medicine being prescribed through conventional medicine has no active

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.400
 thyroid in it.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.400
 That's true.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.860
 But because of I think it's the result of pressure from the pharmaceutical industry

00:12:54.860 --> 00:13:02.140
 making their synthetics, the FDA has begun forcing the producers of the natural thyroid

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:09.980
 products such as Armour Thyroid USP to put on their label the ingredients in terms of

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:14.920
 T4 and T3 but natural thyroid contains neither of those.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:21.600
 It's a protein with only the tiniest trace as a contaminant sometimes of thyroxin or

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:29.440
 the active T3 but now people look at the label and they see T4 and T3 even listed on natural

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.920
 thyroid products and it just isn't there.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:40.560
 When you digest the protein, your digestive system releases those hormones and the gland

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:46.640
 when you digest it or when it digests itself in normal functioning, that protein breaking

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:54.040
 down releases about three or four parts of thyroxin for each part of the active T3 and

00:13:54.040 --> 00:14:01.840
 that's why your liver has to convert the thyroxin which is about 70% of the output of your thyroid

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.840
 gland.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:08.520
 And similarly, when you take a supplement of Armour Thyroid, when you digest it, it's

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:14.200
 in that same ratio so your liver still has to activate three quarters of it and that

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.720
 means that you can't go very far wrong when you're taking the natural substance because

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:25.720
 the ratio entering your blood is within the range produced by your normal gland so your

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.240
 liver can make the decision as to whether to activate it or not.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.720
 Yeah, it's a good point.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.640
 Typically the natural type thyroid and there's a number of different types have a ratio of

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:40.040
 about four to one, T4 to T3 and then what we will typically do in our practice is increase

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:44.640
 that ratio of three to one by adding a little bit of Cytomel which is just pure active T3

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.040
 but when we do that, usually it's because the patient has developed antibodies to their

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.480
 thyroid which you can see in Graves' disease or I've seen it in cases where the patients

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.240
 are taking thyroxin, the synthetic, Synthroid for example and now because they've introduced

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.520
 this foreign substance into their body, it's attacked and so the body now requires more

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.160
 thyroid to overcome that.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.240
 In fact, that one patient I saw recently who said, "Gee, they put me on thyroid and I started

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.080
 gaining weight and then every time they changed the dose, I gained more weight and they wouldn't

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.080
 believe me."

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.440
 So we checked her thyroid antibodies and sure enough, they were very high but every time

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.280
 they gave her the Synthroid, she developed the antibodies and then they upped the dose

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.200
 and the situation just got worse.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.640
 I wouldn't say it happens in every patient but I've seen it enough that I'm very skeptical

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.280
 and never used the thyroxin.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.240
 When I was teaching at the Naturopathic College in Portland, someone from the University of

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:40.320
 Oregon Medical School Hospital told about a woman who had been prescribed, I think it

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:46.680
 was the equivalent of one grain of thyroxin, about 100 micrograms I think it was and she

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:52.000
 got a little worse and more hypothyroid and they kept increasing the dose and when they

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.280
 reached 400 micrograms of thyroxin, she went into a myxedema coma and they took her to

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:03.640
 the hospital unconscious and kept her alive until someone figured out that she wasn't

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:09.440
 converting T4 to T3 and it had simply turned her brain metabolism off to the point that

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.880
 she was no longer conscious and when they gave her T3, she recovered immediately to

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.880
 full functioning.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.000
 Yes, so it's important to have a healthy liver if that's where three-quarters of the conversion

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.560
 is happening and isn't it true that if you're taking let's say the thyroxin, the inactive

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:30.240
 thyroid and it's having a suppressive effect on your brain and can't it, isn't it true

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.720
 that it can build up in your brain and cause other symptoms if it's not being converted?

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:40.640
 Yes, many people have told me that when they were given supposedly the right dose of thyroxin,

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:47.920
 they began getting symptoms like ringing sounds in their ears and prickly sensations, fairly

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:53.440
 common symptoms of hypothyroidism but they would start when they would go on thyroxin

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:58.320
 and when they added T3, the symptoms would go away and be okay.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.720
 What's very interesting is I have many patients come into my office and they've seen other

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.040
 doctors and they tell me that, "Oh, my doctor checked everything."

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.680
 But when it comes to thyroid, I've never seen that happen.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.800
 The doctors will look at just the T4 or just the TSH, they never check the antibodies.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.520
 So the patient never really gets a complete thyroid evaluation even though they're told

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.240
 by the doctor everything is fine.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.440
 So when you're checking the thyroid, in your opinion, what's the best test to be looking

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.440
 at?

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.200
 The way they did it in the 1930s before the drug companies came on the scene, basically

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:32.080
 took control of the journals and the medical schools and made everyone over the next 30

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.800
 or 40 years forget how to treat thyroid patients.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:40.800
 The way they originally did it was to look at symptoms and when they saw definitely too

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:46.800
 many symptoms, they would give them a basal metabolic rate test, how much oxygen they

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:53.800
 consume at rest and that's really the absolute way to determine what's happening.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.200
 It doesn't matter how much is in your blood, if it's being blocked, for example, if you

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:04.560
 have eaten too many polyunsaturated fats or too much cabbage or other antithyroid factors,

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:10.040
 you can have an excess of thyroid hormones in your bloodstream and still not be consuming

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.520
 very much oxygen.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:18.560
 Some people are 20, 30, 40% below normal in oxygen consumption and the ideal way would

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:25.320
 be to give the dose of thyroid until the oxygen consumption is at least normal except Americans

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:32.160
 on comparison with other countries where they don't eat so much the artificial food, Americans

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.840
 on average are about 25% hypometabolic or hypothyroid.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:42.960
 And so the practical thing really is to go by symptoms and checking as many of the physiological

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:50.280
 indicators, for example, reflex reaction time, the speed of your reflex, you can flash a

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:56.000
 light in a person's eye and the pupil is slow to respond if they're hypothyroid.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.600
 The body temperature tends to be usually but not invariably tends to be much below normal

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.240
 when you're hypothyroid.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:10.400
 An excess of stress, strength, and cortisol can artificially raise your temperature.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.440
 So those can go up in hypothyroidism.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:19.240
 So temperature is just one of the indicators and there's a reflex, the Achilles tendon

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.400
 relaxation rate.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.080
 If you have a person nail and thump their Achilles tendon so that it makes their toe

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:31.840
 twitch away from their body, that a person with almost any thyroid function will have

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:38.520
 the reflex but what you watch is how quickly your foot relaxes back to its resting position.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.320
 And a hypothyroid person's foot looks like it has a pneumatic door closer on it.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:48.880
 It carefully or in jerks returns slowly to where it was at rest.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:54.160
 But a person with good thyroid function, the jerking foot looks like a piece of rubber.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.160
 It relaxes and bounces.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.400
 It comes back so fast.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.960
 Yeah, and I checked that in almost all of my patients.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.120
 I'm glad you mentioned that.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.480

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.600
 about the thyroid and other hormones.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.600
 We'll be right back.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.000
 Hi, I'm Dr. Dan Royal, Medical Director for New Hope Medical Center.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 Every day I see patients who suffer from the effects of modern living such as stress, pollution,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.600
 allergies, and even prescription drugs.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.080
 I believe we all deserve to feel as good as we can to be optimally well.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.400
 That's why at New Hope, we emphasize health optimization, not disease management.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.400

 We're back.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.320
 I'm Dr. Dan Royal.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.320
 Thanks for staying with us.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.280
 My guest today is Dr. Ray Peat, and we're talking about the thyroid and other hormones.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.000
 I wanted to bring something to your attention, Dr. Peat, and that is something I see frequently

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.440
 in my practice and throughout America.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.160
 It's the high blood fat issue and the whole cholesterol industry that's been built up

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.160
 around that.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.160
 I would think that one of the signs of high cholesterol would be a low thyroid because

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.080
 normally if you have a healthy metabolism, you should be able to process those fats fairly

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:46.560
 effectively since the liver is the place where that's happening, where those fats are being

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.680
 made, being broken down.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.880
 It's also the place where the thyroid is being converted.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.880
 What do you think about that?

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:58.360
 The liver is a big source of disposal of the cholesterol, but the ovaries, the gonads,

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:04.840
 and the brain itself and the adrenal glands all use considerable amounts of cholesterol.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:11.600
 For example, in one experiment, blood containing a known amount of cholesterol was pumped into

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:17.600
 an ovary, and the amount of progesterone coming out corresponded exactly to the amount of

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.160
 cholesterol going in.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.480
 If you lowered the cholesterol, you lowered the amount of progesterone being produced.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:30.080
 That same conversion happens in the brain and adrenal glands and various other tissues

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.800
 to some extent.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:37.480
 If you're forcing your cholesterol down with a drug, you're likely, for example, many studies

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:44.760
 have shown increased rate of accidents, cancer, and even suicide and death by homicide.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.440
 I think it was one of the major events in the people who were drugged to lower their

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.440
 cholesterol.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:57.840
 The Framingham study following people over many years found that people whose cholesterol

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:04.440
 was below 200 when they were over the age of 50 were much more likely to become demanded

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:09.720
 because cholesterol makes those protective hormones, makes progesterone, for example,

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:15.480
 in the brain, which is extremely protective against all kinds of injury and toxins.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.920
 I'm glad you mentioned that.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.000
 I love it when the side effect of medication is death.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 That's all we need.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 We've got a caller on the line.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.320
 Do you have a question for our guest, Geraldine?

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.320
 I do.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.880
 I'm really enjoying the program.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:31.800
 When I was 16, in Santa Monica, they thought I had a broken jaw.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.200
 They used the x-ray machine and took many plates of my jaw.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.160
 Then right after that, my thyroid really went out.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.440
 Of course, I've had a terrible problem all my life.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:51.560
 I'm wondering what do you recommend having a problem trying to get medication.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.120
 I have trouble sleeping and gaining weight and just the whole thing I've got.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.880
 What do you suggest for a medication?

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.800
 What would you give for a good medication?

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.240
 I used to take...

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:09.800
 The usual thing is to check the diet, make sure the person is getting enough good protein

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:15.840
 because a protein deficiency makes the liver unable to activate the thyroid hormone the

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.360
 same way a lack of sugar does.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.920
 You need at least 80 grams of high quality protein.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:28.200
 For example, milk or cheese or eggs will give you good protein to make the liver able to

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.320
 process the thyroid.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:37.000
 A low thyroid function, the symptoms you mentioned are very classical hypothyroid symptoms because

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.920
 the brain needs energy to go to sleep properly.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:48.560
 Hypothyroid people have been given EEGs which show that they never can get into deep restful

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.760
 slow wave sleep.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:55.280
 They stay in superficial sleep which isn't restful and even worse than that, they often

00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:01.280
 have insomnia and have trouble going to sleep because when your nerves or your muscles are

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.040
 not producing enough energy, fatigue accumulates and they're unable to relax.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.880
 It's the same thing as the Achilles reflex test.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:15.800
 You're slow to relax any cell, any muscle or nerve and when you get fatigued, your brain

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.640
 needs thyroid to relax.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:25.200
 A doctor that I visited, I think it was in either Reno or Las Vegas, had insomnia for

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.560
 two or three days and I suggested Cytomel.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.400
 The next day he said that stuff is better than opium.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:37.080
 He said he was sound asleep 15 minutes after taking a little bit of the active thyroid

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.080
 hormone.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.080
 Oh, that's wonderful.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.080
 I haven't heard of that.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.760
 Yeah, there's nothing better than sleep when you really need it.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.800
 Most people, it's interesting, my patients have the misconception that if I give them

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.840
 thyroid somehow it's some kind of amphetamine that's going to keep them up at night.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.360
 What they don't understand is just what Dr. Peat said, thyroid helps you to relax and

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.080
 helps your reflexes to recover.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.160
 He mentioned the pupillary reflex of the eye as well as your Achilles tendon reflex as

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.640
 well as now the body being able to relax and go to sleep at night.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.200
 Does that help with your question, Geraldine?

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.560
 Oh, I'm very grateful.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.880
 I want to thank you very much.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.880
 All right, thanks for calling.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.880
 Thank you.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.360
 Dr. Peat, one of the things I think we should also mention is that if the thyroid is having

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.000
 a problem, the adrenals do tend to take over and as you mentioned, cortisol levels can

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.200
 be elevated and this can also interrupt the sleep-wake cycle because cortisol should actually

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.960
 be low at night and high in the morning.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.120
 When the sun goes down, various things happen.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:33.720
 For example, the red light or sunlight that penetrates deeply into your cells activates

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:40.600
 processes that protect you against lipid peroxidation and free radicals and it just takes about

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:46.840
 an hour of darkness and your mitochondria start losing efficiency because the free radicals

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.400
 start interfering with them.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:56.520
 When darkness has lasted for several hours, your blood sugar becomes a problem and that's

00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:01.040
 why your cortisol rises after you've been asleep for a couple of hours.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:06.760
 It keeps getting higher and higher until dawn and that allows you to stay asleep because

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:12.960
 the cortisol is breaking down your protein, turning it to sugar, letting the thyroid function,

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.320
 letting your nerve cells repair by getting enough sugar.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:22.400
 But the combination of reactions to the low blood sugar, if your liver didn't store enough

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:28.120
 glycogen, very quickly, early in the night, you'll have an adrenaline reaction trying

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:33.400
 to get more glycogen out of your liver to compensate for the low thyroid function.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:38.960
 Low thyroid people very often have 30 or 40 times more adrenaline being produced than

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.360
 a healthy person and that keeps you awake or makes you wake up with a start after you've

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.000
 been asleep for a while and the adrenaline makes your heart beat faster and wakes you

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.960
 up but it triggers increasing cortisol and the cortisol will start damaging your tissues,

00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:01.600
 making your muscles gradually be converted to sugar to keep your brain working during

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.600
 the night.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:08.240
 And these low thyroid people who compensate with very high amounts of adrenaline and cortisol

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:14.920
 will sometimes wake up with a temperature of 98.6 or 99 degrees which is definitely

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:20.320
 not in what most people think of as the hypothyroid range, 95 or 96 degrees.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.440
 But if you take their temperature out an hour after they've had some orange juice and other

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:30.680
 food in the morning, you'll find that their temperature is down in the extremely hypothyroid

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.680
 range.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:37.400
 It's only the stress hormones before breakfast that keep them up to a normal temperature.

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.640
 It's fascinating how this relates to each other.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.840
 We're going to take another call.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.680
 Yolanda, do you have a question for our guest?

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.680
 Yes.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.680
 Thank you, Dr. Peat.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.560
 I happened upon you guys' radio show today by accident but I think it was to my good

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.560
 fortune.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.360
 I've got a 12-year-old, if you can believe it, with a diagnosis of hypothyroid and really

00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:01.600
 how we found out or how I received the diagnosis is I took her in to a pediatrician to explore

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.720
 whether or not there could be some explanation for what I considered a weight gain that did

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.480
 not seem to correlate with her consumption.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.920
 In other words, it didn't seem like she was eating enough to be gaining the weight at

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.920
 the rate that she was.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.520
 They did a number of blood tests and I guess her T3 came back really high.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:21.600
 Then I was referred to a pediatric endocrinologist and there are not very many here in Southern

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.640
 Nevada so I had to wait several months.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.960
 Let me just make a comment about that, Yolanda.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.560
 One of the problems that I see in the thyroid testing is what they're checking is T3 uptake

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.680
 which is a mathematical guesstimation.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:38.360
 They're not usually checking T3-RIA which is a more accurate assessment of the active

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.360
 thyroid.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.320
 If your child has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and the T3 is elevated, that doesn't make

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.320
 sense.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.320
 That's a total contradiction in terms.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.320
 Right.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.480
 What happened was when I went to the pediatric endocrinologist, he wanted to run his own

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.480
 series of tests.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.480
 I'll be honest with you.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:56.800
 This has been a couple of years ago and I can't remember exactly but he was the one

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.080
 who gave me the diagnosis based on his set of tests.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.760
 I can't remember what was too high for the T4 and TSH.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.280
 He takes TSH, T4 and we do it every six months.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.600
 He did the antibodies you were speaking of early as well.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.800
 She was not positive for the antibodies.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.800
 What is the medication she's taking?

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.080
 She's taking and that's why I wanted to talk to you because I was like, "It sounds like

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.160
 you all aren't recommending the Synthroid."

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.200
 She's on 0.88 of the Synthroid and has been for two years.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.200
 Absolutely not.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.080
 That would not be our approach based on what you've heard in this program.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.720
 It's like Gorder, you know what I mean by that?

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:37.720
 There are three times when women are more likely to become hypothyroid and you can very

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.580
 often see the signs even if they aren't experiencing any symptoms.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:49.160
 You can see the thyroid gland enlarging around puberty and again at pregnancy and again around

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.160
 menopause.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:56.080
 What happens is they've studied it with slices of the tissue in a culture dish.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:03.160
 As estrogen rises, the brain senses that you need more thyroid hormone, puts out more TSH

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:09.280
 but the estrogen blocks the enzymes that digest that protein in the thyroid gland so it stops

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:16.200
 secreting the active hormone and progesterone happens to activate those enzymes and allow

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.200
 the gland to secrete.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:24.360
 You can pretty much depend on the slowing down of the thyroid whenever there's a situation

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.840
 that raises estrogen and puberty is the most common one.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:34.120
 Typically girls in their teens will have an enlarged thyroid compared to boys because

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:38.320
 that's the standard effect of estrogen even when you're healthy.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.800
 So what we would typically recommend at New Hope Medical, I'll just kind of give you some

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.920
 free advice here, we would typically put the patient on a grain of the natural thyroid

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.200
 and have them take it twice a day.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.040
 The reason for that is because natural thyroid has a half-life of about 8 to 12 hours.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.360
 The body's actually utilizing it, digesting it, processing it as opposed to hanging around

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.360
 for 24 hours waiting for the body to convert it to active thyroid if that's actually happening

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.360
 with the synthroid.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.680
 We're going to go ahead and take a short break.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.600
 We thank you for calling and when we come back we'll take another caller.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.600

 We're back.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.200
 I'm Dr. Dan Royer and you've been listening to Hope for Health.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:09.640
 Our guest today is Dr. Ray Peat who is an independent scientist with a background expertise

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:13.400
 in female hormones and we've been discussing thyroid today and we're going to continue

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.200
 that discussion with our caller on the line.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.000
 Stan, do you have a question for Dr. Peat?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.480
 About the thyroid and Dr. Wilson who's a DO, what was that side e-mail?

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.320
 Is that a prescription item or was that an over-the-counter supplement?

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.120
 No, that is a prescription item.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.120
 Okay.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:33.200
 Dr. Wilson who's a DO, he's done years of research on the thyroid where it's kind of

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.240
 a little bit subclinical where the doctor tells you it's normal for people who are running

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:45.280
 temperatures of like 97, 97.1 and they have like cold hands sometimes, cold feet and they're

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.040
 very, very sluggish in the morning hours.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:53.720
 Was Dr. Wilson on target with the temperature situation of subclinical thyroid?

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.000
 I'm going to let Dr. Peat answer this with you after.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 Is that okay?

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 Okay.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.680
 And can I also ask him, he recommends that as Dr. Wilson after 20 years of research that

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:10.040
 the armor thyroid T3 will really properly fix this issue and kind of resetting the thyroid,

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:15.080
 unclogging it so that you get a proper amount of T3 in the blood and the doctors just look

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.200
 at T4 when we get these blood tests.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.200
 Correct.

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.000
 I'm giving you a lot but you want me to hang up and listen?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 Yeah.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 Is that okay?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 Okay.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.640
 I hope you can remember all of it because it's a lot in there.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:27.640
 We will.

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.640
 Okay.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.640
 Thanks a lot.

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.640
 You're welcome.

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:31.640
 Okay.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.640
 So first I think we should clarify that Wilson syndrome is primarily referring to that reverse

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:37.240
 T3 that's another element of thyroid testing that can be assessed.

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:42.200
 And so I think that the question you had Dr. Peat was how accurate number one is the basal

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.200
 body temperature?

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:48.160
 And number two, can the problem of Wilson syndrome can be corrected with T3?

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.160
 Yeah.

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:55.280
 The thing that I mentioned about the stress hormones causing a falsely elevated normal

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.900
 appearing temperature, that's something that you should watch out for.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:05.280
 If someone has had an unusual diet without enough protein or if they're in the menopause

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:12.960
 years, it's very common for women to experience excess cortisol around menopause.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:19.800
 And that's one of the major things that causes the deposit of fat around the trunk at menopause

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.800
 and the weakening of the bones.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.760
 Cortisol accelerates dissolving of the bones and deposition of fat.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:32.440
 And people with those symptoms, even if they're younger, they should be checked for excess

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.120
 adrenaline and cortisol.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:39.200
 And a protein deficiency is a common cause of that whole pattern.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:46.600
 The reverse T3 rises when you're under stress and exposed to too much cortisol and a very

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:51.600
 bad diet can be enough to put you into that chronic stress state.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:58.120
 And the quickest way out of it is with a supplement, a reliably formulated supplement of T3.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:04.920
 But the armor thyroid and a traditional product made by the same company called ThyroLarve,

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:11.600
 which was a synthetic made to be equivalent to the natural thyroid, those will provide

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.880
 enough T3 for most people.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:20.840
 But there's people who almost always prefer to have a little more T3 than that if they

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.880
 want to quickly get over their symptoms.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.760
 Yeah, that's a good point.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.360
 And what I found in my testing of patients is that reverse T3, in terms of being able

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.220
 to document, is actually quite difficult and rarely seen.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:36.400
 But there are so many other factors by which you can diagnose hypothyroidism, some which

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:41.080
 we've talked about in this program, such as the low T4, low T3, the high TSH, the thyroid

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:45.560
 antibodies, not to mention the clinical conditions that need to be looked at.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.960
 So for example, you could have a patient that has normal thyroid function, but yet they

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.360
 have clinical symptomatology, signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.360
 What are you going to do?

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.320
 Most doctors would not treat because, well, the lab says they're fine.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.520
 Well, you don't need a doctor to diagnose a patient who's fine in the lab work.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.200
 You need a doctor who can assess whether the patient needs thyroid, even though the lab

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.040
 is abnormal, and be able to explain why.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.800
 The traditional doctors did fine just going by signs.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:17.560
 And as many of the measures as they knew were reliable, such as oxygen consumption and the

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:21.240
 cholesterol level, and they would look at the palms of a person's hands.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:27.840
 A low thyroid person can't convert carotene to vitamin A, and so they will typically accumulate

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:32.920
 orange in the calluses of their hands and feet, and their skin, their hands and feet

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.460
 are almost always cold because their metabolic rate is low.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:42.040
 Even though their core temperature might be kept up by adrenaline and cortisol, their

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:48.320
 fingers and toes are likely to be cooler than other people's at the same environmental temperature.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:54.920
 And cold feet, interestingly, can cause serious inflammatory problems elsewhere in the body.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:38:01.320
 So a first aid for some of the symptoms of hypothyroidism is just to get some wooly underwear

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.320
 and thick stockings.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:08.880
 And you can also keep your extremities warm because you can actually cure anemia even

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:15.240
 without correcting your whole metabolic situation just by keeping your long bones warmer, reducing

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.520
 the inflammatory substances produced in cold feet.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.520
 Yeah, that's very interesting.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.200
 And you can also correct that by supplementing the adrenals so they don't have to put out

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:28.340
 so much adrenaline by using the natural DHA and pregnenolone hormones.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:32.480
 But some of the clinical signs of hypothyroidism, which are very obvious and, of course, taken

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:37.840
 together, should raise your index of suspicion, and they include fatigue, overweight or obesity,

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.560
 and edema, among other things.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.640
 Anyway, we have a caller on the line, and I think she has a question for our guest.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.040
 Earlene, did you have a question you'd like to ask?

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.320
 I'm 36, 70, and I have had all...

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.320
 I'm diabetic.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.400
 I don't take any insulin, and I don't take any diabetic medicine.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.280
 I've been trying to control it with diet.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:59.240
 But what I'm worried about is my arthritis seemed to get worse after I had the hysterectomy,

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.760
 and I have osteoarthritis, not the other kind.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.200
 I was wondering if this had anything to do with hormones.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.800
 Absolutely, hormones are related.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:10.200
 And one of the things that should be checked, in my opinion, is the female hormones along

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:15.600
 with the thyroid and other more comprehensive testing to give us a bigger picture of what's

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.600
 going on.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.080
 But as Dr. Peat, when I mentioned earlier, as a woman goes through menopause, this is one

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:25.160
 of those transitions in life where the hypothyroidism issue can manifest.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.000
 And some people also have the theory that when you're in pain or inflammation all the

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.120
 time that your cortisol level may actually not be quite high enough, and so that's keeping

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.120
 you in pain all the time.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.560
 So these are some issues that should be considered.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.640
 What do you think, Dr. Peat?

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:43.800
 I had a friend who was in his 70s and had an accident and immediately started developing

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:50.040
 arthritis and was crippled pretty suddenly by arthritis in his hands and feet and knees.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:57.480
 And he luckily had a doctor who had been educated in the 1930s who immediately tested his thyroid

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.880
 because stress and injury can lower your thyroid.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.440
 And my friend was grumpy and said, "I didn't go to have you fix my thyroid.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.400
 I wanted you to fix the arthritis."

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:12.240
 But within two weeks, his arthritis cleared up and he lived 15 years more, never any more

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.240
 arthritis.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:19.080
 In the 30s, it was standard knowledge that arthritis was usually a sign of hypothyroidism.

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.840
 Yeah, that's a good point.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:26.160
 Any trauma in your life like having a baby or having a surgery, these things can trigger

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:30.080
 hypothyroidism because it's such a stress from which you may not recover.

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.940
 And as Dr. Peat said, you need a doctor with a little more intuition who uses his right

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:37.680
 brain and can diagnose these problems without being wholly reliant upon the lab.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.320
 Anyway, we thank you for calling, Earline.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.920
 We're going to take a short break, and when we come back, we'll continue our discussion

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.920
 with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.640
 I'm Dr. Dan Royal, and you're listening to Hope for Health.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.640
 We'll be right back.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.000
 Hi, I'm Dr. Dan Royal.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.880
 I'm the director for New Hope Medical Center.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.360
 Every day, I see patients who suffer from the effects of modern living such as stress,

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.480
 pollution, allergies, and even prescription drugs.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.880
 I believe we all deserve to feel as good as we can to be optimally well.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.160
 That's why at New Hope, we emphasize health optimization, not disease management.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:07.200
 For more information, call New Hope Medical at 476-0000.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.400
 Learn the secrets to living a great life by consulting with a doctor who really cares

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.560
 about you and your health.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.840
 Call 476-0000 now.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.840
 Does your back ache?

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.840
 Is your neck in pain?

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.840
 Would you like to be pain-free?

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.280
 Then get Vax-D.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:23.120
 Vax-D is a non-surgical treatment clinically proven to be successful in over 86% of patients

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.520
 with back pain, sciatica, and bulging, permeated, or degenerative discs.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:30.480
 Vax-D gently decompresses the area of injuring pain, draws nutrients into the area, and promotes

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.880
 relaxation and repair.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.640
 For more information, call New Hope Medical at 476-0000.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.640
 Take your life back.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:42.280
 Get pain-free with Vax-D. Call 476-0000 now and make your appointment for Vax-D treatment

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.280
 today.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.280
 I'm back.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.280
 I'm Dr. Dan Royal.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.280
 You're listening to Hope for Health.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.280
 My guest today has been Dr. Ray Peat.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.760
 He's been sitting down our show here, but we're going to go ahead and take one more

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.760
 call.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.760
 Bill, you're on the line.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.760
 Do you have a question for our guest?

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.480
 It's not mostly a question.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:00.400
 I was born with Wilson's disease and have lived with it through diet and nutrition.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.680
 I have kept it under control.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:10.240
 I was on KKVV for about three and a half years with stepping to the other side of health.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:16.360
 I have a vague idea to Wilson's disease from the inside, so to speak, having had it and

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.320
 had it all my life.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:23.240
 One of the things that people will tell you is that you can't live without fat.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.240
 I'm living proof.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:29.800
 I'm past 75, and I'm living proof you can live without eating fat.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:34.520
 If sometime in the future you ever want to get around to discussing Wilson's again, I'll

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.320
 be more than happy to call in again.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.320
 All right.

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.320
 Appreciate your call.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.320
 Thanks, Bill.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.320
 You have a great day.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.320
 Thank you.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.320
 You too.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:47.360
 I think that eating saturated fats, they can have some therapeutic effects.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:52.160
 I'm also an advocate of fruit-centered diet.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:57.320
 There are animals that live on fruit, for example, the squirrel monkey, which lives

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:05.000
 about three times as long as other animals of its size and has an extremely high metabolic

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.080
 rate.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:10.000
 In the wild, it lives exclusively on fruit.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.720
 That's sort of a way to think about the effect of fruit on your physiology because the fruit

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:21.560
 contains the things needed to stimulate your thyroid function and protect against stress.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:27.480
 It is possible to live entirely without fat in your diet because your body can make the

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.800
 saturated fats that it needs.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.560
 That's a good point.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:35.000
 Saturated fat is what the thyroid needs, and you can get that from coconut oil, which I

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.320
 use in my own cooking.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.600
 On the other hand, you have a lot of patients who are taking these unsaturated fatty acids,

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.560
 which are actually inhibiting the thyroid.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:48.520
 The more unsaturated the fat is, the more thoroughly it inhibits the thyroid.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:53.400
 It inhibits secretion, transport, and reaction to the thyroid.

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:59.400
 In the early part of the last century, several researchers showed that animals on a fat-free

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:05.320
 diet were completely free of spontaneous cancer and lived longer than normal.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:09.240
 That's very interesting, but at the very least, a patient, if they're taking unsaturated fat,

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:13.040
 should be combining it with saturated fat so they have some kind of balance.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.520
 Anyway, we're coming to the conclusion of our show.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.520
 Thank you.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.520
 My man in the sound room over there is roaring like a lion.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.200
 Dr. Peat, any concluding remarks for our listeners today?

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:26.800
 Well, there's a book that you might be able to find in a big library or a used bookstore

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:32.160
 that is really a great introduction to the amazing things that thyroid can do.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.080
 It's "The Thyroid" by Thomas McGaffick.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.080
 Okay, "Thyroid" by Thomas McGaffick.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.080
 I appreciate being with us, Dr. Peat.

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.640
 This has been very interesting, and I hope it's been interesting for you, our audience.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.920
 I'm Dr. Dan Royal.

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.440
 You've been listening to Hope for Health, which is brought to you by New Hope Medical

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:52.160
 Center located here in town, where you can find us at 215 N Pecos.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.400
 We invite you to tune in again this same time again next week for another important program

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.680
 on health alternatives with Hope for Health.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.760
 Until then, you have a great life.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.760
 By my own fame.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.760
 Isn't it great?
