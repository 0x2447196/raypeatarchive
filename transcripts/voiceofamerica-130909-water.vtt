 Welcome to the Sharon Kleiner Hour.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 Health, environment and the power of water.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.400
 What you hear in the next hour could very well save your life.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.440
 Now here's your host, Sharon Kleiner.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.640
 I want to invite you to listen to the Sharon Kleiner Hour.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.920
 The Power of Water.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.680
 I'm Sharon Kleiner.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.800
 For many years I have been studying, for over 30 years, water, water, water.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.200
 But I chose to study not only the water that we're living with on the surface of the earth,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.400
 below the surface of the earth and around our planet, but also the water vapor, that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.120
 humidity you've heard about, water vapor, the greenhouse gas effects with water vapor.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.160
 The water vapor from the moment you were born became your most important influence of your

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.160
 life.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.840
 It's where you live and the air you're breathing.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.480
 That became a focus.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.200
 Without water on earth, there would be no water vapor, humidity for you to stay alive,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.200
 all of us.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.680
 These are the symptoms of your life, individually.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.040
 The moment you were born in that delivery room, you opened your eyes.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.320
 There are no two eyes alike, no two fingerprints alike, and more.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.760
 We're all different.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.680
 We're all dehydrating differently.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.920
 So that water vapor in the air is so influential.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.840
 Water on the earth, water vapor, and what is happening with our cloud system.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.320
 We've been talking about this for so long.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.480
 The one influence I'm trying to express here throughout the world, listening on Voice America

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.800
 and our Apple iTunes and our syndications, is let's get together and learn more about

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.240
 the education that we're all providing.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.920
 All of us, each one of us, participate on the earth lasting forever.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.800
 But we can't do it without water on the surface, fresh water, and water vapor, and that cloud

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.440
 system, and then influence each other and those aquifers.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.600
 Example, here in America, I'm an American, here in the United States of America, I'm

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.640
 coming to you from Oregon.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.320
 I'm in southern Oregon in the Rogue River Valley, sitting here on the famous Rogue River

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.040
 and the most beautiful rivers of the world and the mountains that are gorgeous with tall

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.520
 trees and green and gorgeous and on water.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.040
 We're even having challenges with water.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.240
 The water is around us, but we're having challenges.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:26.560
 Now in America, there's no place in the world that uses more water a day than in the Americans.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.040
 After showering, using the bathroom and brushing our teeth, and having one cup of coffee or

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.000
 tea, this typically takes 30 gallons of water.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.920
 Now I'm used to doing that, and many people in America and throughout the world are used

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:50.960
 to showering, bathing, and brushing their teeth, having a cup of coffee or tea, and

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:58.400
 using the facilities of the bathroom, and they can be using over 30 gallons of water

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.280
 right there.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:10.800
 After doing dishes with a dishwasher, 12 gallons per load, running a washing machine, 43 gallons

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:18.320
 of water per load, watering your lawn, which here in America we love our green lawns, 10

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.440
 gallons per minute.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:28.800
 By the time we go to bed, the average American is using 150 gallons of water a day.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.840
 So therefore, when I say the concerns I have about fresh water is serious, look what's

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.120
 happening in China.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:46.680
 They have 118 rivers polluted, the black carbon particle in the air is polluting the waters,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.680
 the water vapor they're breathing, and all of us around the world, we can go indoors

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.280
 with insulated windows and walls and have a pollution problem in America because we

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.480
 have insulated windows and walls and forced air heating and cooling.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.480
 The subject matter has been coming up more and more thanks to people out there like ourselves

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.720
 and others that are really promoting this throughout the world.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.800
 Water is overtaking oil as our scarcest natural resource in the world says, Stephen Solomon,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.520
 and we've had Stephen Solomon on here.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:29.680
 He's the author of a book called Water, the Epic Struggle for Wealth, Power, and Civilization.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.800
 Even we're going to find in the United States as well, that in the United States by 2030,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.860
 we could be short 40% of the water we require.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.800
 Other books are out, Water Wars.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.360
 War has been going on around water since the beginning of time.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.800
 Have you ever noticed that the cities and the communities and the villages are surrounded

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.800
 by water?

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.920
 They go to water.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:03.600
 At one point in 2001, the New York Times featured a full front page story on water scarcity.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.680
 This was back in 2001.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.520
 That's going to be a water scarcity and that in Texas we'll have a water scarcity.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.160
 Even though oil has made them rich, the problem is they're not going to have the oil.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.760
 The liquid gold for Texas and other places in the world is going to be the water.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.680
 The water that surrounds us, although always has been recognized to everyone all over the

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.880
 world, has been the source of life.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.960
 What's going to happen when you don't have it?

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.880
 Will you go steal it from your neighbor?

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.000
 Will you go take it from the river coming from another state?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.520
 The potential of this is very concerning, but we can all do something about it together.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.120
 There's a book out there called Water Wars that you need to read about.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.280
 There's an individual who wrote it and I'm going to spell it.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:11.720
 Vandana Shiva, it's an excellent book on water wars.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.840
 We have a book that we had Dr. Neil Grigg on here, Water Finance.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:25.560
 Water will become the most expensive part of your life in time unless we begin to study

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.840
 it more and more and what we can do with it.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.840
 I can't emphasize it more and that's what this show has been about.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.480
 Today I have an exciting guest.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.320
 I was really looking forward to having him on for you to learn more about water and your

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.760
 life and your organisms and how you function as a body.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:50.360
 We're functioning on 80% water and those cells, up to 50 trillion of them in your body, must

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:56.120
 function with you drinking water every day and how you eat and how you conduct your life

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.120
 and what you choose in your life.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.120
 His name is Dr. Ray Peat.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.120
 His last name is P-E-A-T, PhD.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.440
 He comes from Eugene, Oregon.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.400
 The topic today is going to be aging, nutrition, and hormones.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.080
 We'll be talking a lot about water.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:19.560
 We'll listen to our sponsor, Biologic Aqua Research's product, Nature's Tears I Missed.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:25.400
 Nature's Tears I Missed is a technology to supplement the tear film of the surface of

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.520
 your eye.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:33.800
 Did you know that the surface of your eye is 98% water and you have an aqueous middle

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.520
 layer in your tear film?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.280
 The doctors were never able to really discuss the tear film until there became a product

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.280
 to compare it to.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:49.120
 Nature's Tears I Missed is that 100% natural water to supplement for dry eye.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:56.120
 We'll listen to our sponsor and we'll be right back with Dr. Peat.

 You're listening to the Sharon Kleiner Hour.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:37.840
 I'm Dr. Peat.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.840
 Are you with us?

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.840
 Yes, I am.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.840
 Thank you for joining us.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.640
 I know how busy you've been and I've been really looking forward to this.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.520
 Our listeners around the world, I would like them to get to know who you are.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.480
 You have a Ph.D. in biology and it's from the University of Oregon.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.760
 You're specializing in physiology.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:08.360
 You've taught at many schools and you've continued your research, I could see, since way back

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.880
 in the 70s.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.560
 You may have started earlier.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.040
 I want the audience to know you've continued in research a long time with your mission

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.920
 here to understand aging, nutrition, hormones and more.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:29.280
 You can tell the audience what your focus has been for so long.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:38.320
 I didn't actually start professional biology study until 1968 at the university.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:45.320
 I studied there for four years in physiology and biochemistry.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:55.040
 Before that, around 1950, I had heard about Albert St. Georgie and the lectures he went

00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:05.520
 around the country doing demonstrations of living tissue and the state of water inside

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.200
 muscles for example.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:17.120
 He could show that the condition of the water as it affected molecules changed instantaneously

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:24.200
 when a muscle was stimulated or when a nerve was activated.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:32.560
 I looked around to see who else was working on that kind of thing and it was utterly neglected

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.120
 by the professional biologists.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:43.600
 He happened to have got interested in this line of thinking many years earlier, got his

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:54.160
 Nobel Prize working on vitamin C, but his real interest was in how the state of water

00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:03.760
 changes between life and death and different states of energy production.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:11.520
 I had that in mind all through the 60s and I taught a biology course in Ohio at a little

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:23.400
 college and while I was working there, Linus Pauling did some research that lined up with

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:33.720
 Albert St. Georgie and he proposed that anesthetics work by altering the state of water in cells.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:46.080
 I looked around again and saw that the chemical community was ignoring Linus Pauling even

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:54.120
 though he had the Nobel Prize and these two people were outstanding for their interest

00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:02.440
 in how water lets organisms work.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:13.160
 For several years, I decided that despite the established academic science culture lacking

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:21.520
 any interest in what I wanted to study, I had enough experience with universities to

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:28.440
 go through and use their instruments to do the research I wanted without getting indoctrinated

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:36.520
 by their belief that everything is governed by genes, molecules, membranes and so on.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.760
 Why do you think they left so much behind?

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:46.240
 Because as you've known by far greater than I, more studies that you've done is so far

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:54.000
 back in the 1500s, 1800s and more, they really were studying all of this.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:03.600
 Like Lawrence Henderson who had a lot of research on water and the fitness of the environment

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.560
 and these doctors.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:11.920
 You have a doctor, Gilbert Ling here, a Ph.D. that I've read here that you've discussed.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:17.040
 Why do you think they left all that study behind?

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:24.520
 It was a philosophical doctrine that took over.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:31.480
 It related to the mainline medicine.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:45.320
 Allopathic medicine had its idea of what an organism is and the gene people were representing

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:52.840
 almost a religious line of thinking that hated to admit that organisms were as complicated

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.680
 as they are.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:16:00.800
 They were imposing this system of beliefs all through science.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:10.760
 There's a book by someone that I knew in the 1960s called Cold War in Biology that explains

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:20.840
 how there was a doctrinaire political campaign going on all through the universities of America

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:32.000
 to change the thinking and direct thoughts to genetic engineering to make it an industrial,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.920
 manageable concept of how organisms work.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:47.000
 The other people were going directly to the organisms, seeing what happens.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:57.120
 The mainline thinking wanted to go from factories to doctors to what they could sell.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.200
 They were putting the marketing department first.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:07.960
 I noticed that in one of your descriptions and I totally agree with you on that, doctor.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:13.040
 I've noticed that when I have been out there for so long doing what I do with my research

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.080
 and then I took a product to market, water, I was the first person to do what I did with

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.440
 water.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:28.280
 I always discuss the benefit and the education behind it all and the marketing will come

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:35.280
 with it if you do that correctly to get it better understood why the product has a benefit.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.280
 You're right.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:41.800
 A lot of people go to the market selling the product and forgetting what the product is

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.000
 benefiting to do and more.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 You're right.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 I've gotten into maybe the greed, let's call it, to be fair to them.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.200
 I'll come up with another side of it, but the greed of getting it out there, getting

00:17:54.200 --> 00:18:01.880
 it understood that this will sell quicker, this will get a patent quicker maybe if they

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.200
 go about it that direction.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:11.200
 To be fair to everyone, I always say, "Well, the word patent, Dr. Peat, came up long ago

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.440
 and if you could get a patent on it and for so long they didn't think you could get a

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.240
 patent on the description of water."

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.760
 Now they know they can.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.760
 I did it.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:30.720
 But the thing is, when I first launched a product for the skin, because I was so convinced

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.360
 that what you're saying is the skin is dehydrating.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:39.760
 The skin on the outside of the body needs hydration, water.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:44.560
 Then they said when I was looking for capital, they'd say, "Well, can it be patented?"

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.280
 I'm sitting there just fuming.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:53.960
 I learned, to be fair, everything in marketing, they want it to be patented.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.280
 Then when I decided to do one, I was asked to do one for the eyes because the dehydrated

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.760
 eyes at the service in the tear film, I studied it.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.040
 Then we decided, "Let's go for a patent there," and we've been patented, almost approved all

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.040
 over the world with a description of water.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:15.960
 When you look back on it, Dr. Peat, do you think that's why they left the water behind?

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:23.440
 Because water is the primary reason we're alive and dehydration is the word that you

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.720
 very seldom hear about until all of a sudden lately.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:32.400
 Have you noticed, Dr., you're hearing the word dehydration quite commonly lately, not

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.660
 just because your temperature is rising.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.800
 You're hearing the word dehydration.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:45.760
 I think it's a matter of being able to control products.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:56.020
 When I took my first course in muscle physiology, water was absolutely neglected.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:07.440
 The membrane was there to keep the water inside and the enzymes caused reactions, but the

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:16.560
 way the water handled, controlled the chemical reactions was absolutely neglected and the

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.880
 professors didn't want to talk about it.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:26.240
 In electron microscopy, my professor had his model of how the little parts inside the cell

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:36.260
 worked and the spaces were so narrow that only a few layers of water would fit between

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:43.040
 the molecules, but he absolutely didn't want to talk about what was in those spaces.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:51.320
 But a professor at the University of Washington, Gerald Pollack, is demonstrating that he has

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.700
 videos available on the Internet that are just amazing.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:05.440
 He shows that the effect of a surface organizes water and causes water to be in control of

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:13.840
 things dissolved in it at a tremendous distance out from the surface, which is vastly greater

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.400
 than the areas involved inside the cell.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:25.040
 So when you look back at what these professors were doing, they were basically being crazy

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:31.880
 to ignore the great power of the water inside the cell when Gerald Pollack is demonstrating

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:40.840
 that it extends out so you can see it in a beaker or in a glass tube.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.960
 To be fair, because of the medical team I've put together throughout the years, there are

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:52.520
 physicians and surgeons in all backgrounds, nature paths and more, PhDs, until they have

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.240
 something to compare to, they're all afraid to discuss it, the nature of what it is.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.920
 Now you could answer that better than I.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:05.840
 There is a nature to the water, there is a nature to its function, and the dehydration

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:06.840
 effect from birth.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:14.080
 What do you think to analyze that, because it's been causing a lot of problems that

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.280
 they don't want to go to the nature of that molecule in the cell.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:25.120
 In fact, I had a Nobel Prize winner on here, Doctor, and he said, "Sharon, it took me

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:32.000
 25 years, millions of dollars, and no end of doctors to prove there is water there in

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 that cell."

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 It didn't go anywhere.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Now there's water.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.040
 Doctor, can you imagine how far we've come in research and they still don't want to admit

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.720
 that we're made up of water and when the research goes in to study all of these diseases and

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.000
 symptoms, they don't go after the dehydration and the water first.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.720
 I think they should.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.000
 I'm committed to that statement.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.320
 When I was a little kid, I would ask people why the water was blue, and they would say

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.240
 it was the sky reflecting in it.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:14.120
 I was at Crater Lake on a cloudy day when the sky was absolutely gray and the lake was

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.920
 just as blue as ever.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:25.200
 The whole culture, including Science Magazine, the journal of the American Association for

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:32.440
 the Advancement of Science, they were as recently as the 1970s publishing articles claiming

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:43.680
 that basically it was the sky, the way light was interacting with the water.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:51.240
 But Linus Pauling, way back in one of his textbooks, said in the properties of water,

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.960
 it's a blue substance.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:03.440
 The fact that you can put water in a bucket and it's blue, it's simply obvious to the

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:13.400
 eye, but science had this insane need to abstract things, to say water basically isn't there.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:20.760
 It has only these things that we are willing to assign it.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.560
 That is the common sense.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:30.720
 With your background, as educated as you are and as much as you've learned with your research

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:35.920
 and more and publications to write now, there's common sense.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:41.320
 I've been very lucky.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:47.360
 I've had the head of stem cell transplant research from Harvard on here.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.960
 She agrees, water.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:58.680
 I've had the head of nutrition research from Harvard and he said water and nutrition.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:03.120
 You with your background have been pounding the pavement for so long.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:10.960
 Water and the individualities of what is happening to the body and its water content in its cells

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.000
 and relationships to how it's living.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.600
 I've gone after the air we're living in because I found that they ignored the water vapor

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.640
 too, doctor.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:30.960
 You hear the word humidity, but water vapor, greenhouse gas go together.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:38.840
 Carbon dioxide much later, but there's an influence with the body water, the water vapor,

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:46.280
 the cloud system, the water on the surface of our earth plus what's in the aquifer all

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.280
 over the world.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.640
 That's a relationship we all have.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.480
 Now tell us, what is magnet, what you're teaching us?

00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:00.360
 Magnet is a stabilizer of the whole water system, ground water and air water depend

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:04.480
 on the interaction of forests.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:10.080
 Deforestation has been causing a terrible change in the water system.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.760
 Exactly, and the water vapor and the cloud system.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.560
 Right, right.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:26.240
 We have a part of our team, Dr. Duane Cecil, PhD, who was with NASA for 35 years and NOAA.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:32.000
 He has said the same thing, that this impact, but it can be corrected.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.160
 They can go back in and you know, doctor, I truly believe that I could be wrong and

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.160
 you know better than I.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.040
 I'm going to give you an example.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.920
 People are not educated about it.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.400
 When we're talking water, we're talking about the obvious.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.960
 There's the puddle, there's the lake, there's the stream, there's the river.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.320
 We've got to be careful with the irrigation water.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.480
 They're hearing always the same thing.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:04.600
 They're never hearing that they're water, that they're made up of water and the impact

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:11.560
 on them with the water vapor and the cloud system, the fresh water on the surface.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:16.040
 People have to be impacted personally to feel what is happening to them.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.920
 The education has not been what you just said today.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:27.840
 The walking human being is water and we need to look at the symptoms of their life individually

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.640
 as being related to the water in them and the water around them.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.480
 They're not being educated about that, doctor.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:44.600
 Part of the water system is the trunk of trees.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:53.800
 The wood is moist and there are channels so that the moisture from inside the tree comes

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.480
 out into the leaves.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:07.240
 When the roots are slightly deprived of water, the tree can live by moving water from inside

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.240
 its trunk.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:18.620
 The bigger the trunk is, the greater the reservoir of available water to put back into the air.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:25.480
 If you cut down trees that are five or six feet in diameter and replace them with a forest

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:36.200
 of trees that are six or eight inches in diameter, they are unstable as regulators of atmospheric

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:44.400
 water because there's just a very tiny reservoir available to them.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:52.080
 So when the humidity goes down in the air, they aren't able to replenish it from these

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.360
 huge tanks of water in their trunks.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:01.600
 And what's going on below their root system into the base of the earth below the soil.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:07.320
 Something just came to my mind as you were talking.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:13.440
 When our forest environmentalists were very concerned about the forest and not the cutting

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.920
 at all, but they also didn't want to have the dead trees cut or the dead brush, which

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:24.200
 brought in a lot of insects and problems.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:30.200
 If I put you in a spot, don't let me do that with this question, but what happens to the

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:36.960
 healthy forest when you have dead trees around it, around the forest and in the forest and

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.240
 the brush and the insects?

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.560
 What would that do to dehydration of the trees?

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:50.720
 The insects come in after the forest is dying, basically, because the immune system of the

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.520
 tree depends on good nourishment.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:01.520
 And part of the nourishment comes from the rotting old generations.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.040
 It's like organic gardening.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:11.840
 You put the residue, the corn stalks, chop them up, let them rot and put them back in

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.720
 the soil so that the minerals that were taken out of the soil are constantly going back

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.300
 into the soil.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:28.920
 If you take a forest fire, it will reduce the brush and dead material to ashes, but

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:33.640
 the ashes feed the soil and the next generation of trees and keep the cycle going.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:40.600
 But if you haul out the lumber and burn it somewhere else and dump the ashes basically

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:46.360
 into the rivers and oceans, you're polluting the rivers and oceans and starving the forest

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:57.080
 soils by hauling that tremendous amount of organic mineral residue out of the forests.

00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:05.760
 You know, when you're talking there for a moment, I was following you with why you chose.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:11.400
 You're so knowledgeable and you've done exactly what is so important to save lives on this

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:17.040
 planet as you went to the depths of the origination of what the planet started with.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:23.320
 We started with water vapor, water, fresh water, and then of course all of that ran

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.160
 down to a low point called an ocean.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.680
 And fresh water has an enormous influence on this planet.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:37.320
 As Gene Cernan said when he was on the moon the last time, he's looking back at Earth

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:46.760
 and he sees that blue ball of water vapor around Earth, and he said that's God's porch.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:54.560
 And meaningfully, without the water and understanding and better education about water, people will

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.560
 take it for granted.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:32:01.200
 And it's like Peter Brabeck, the chairman of Nestle, said, and he's really passionate

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.840
 about water and the mission for himself, and Water II, Doctor.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:10.840
 He said, too, people don't realize they're pricing it now because people have taken it

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:16.000
 so much for granted, Doctor, that it's going to become so much more expensive because they

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.880
 took it way too for granted.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.880
 Water.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.880
 Yeah.

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:26.000
 Vandana Shiva has some very important videos available on the Internet.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:34.440
 She was trained as a physicist, I think a nuclear physicist, but she realized that nuclear

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:41.600
 energy wasn't going to help the health of the planet, that looking at the water economy

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.600
 was the really important thing.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.360
 That's the woman, did you hear me before I started the show?

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.720
 That's the book I was talking about at the beginning of the show.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.720
 Yeah.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:57.680
 She, for many years, has been doing videos and movies, documentaries on the importance

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.840
 of saving the water resources.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.840
 We need to take a break.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.520
 This will be our last one.

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.520
 Don't go anywhere.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.920
 Then we're going to come back, and you're going to educate us about what your research

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:20.240
 has been finding in the different categories of progesterone and the hormones.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:26.800
 Then we'll get into aging and nutrition because that aging and nutrition go together and the

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.720
 dehydration effects of the body, as far as I'm concerned.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.720
 Don't go anywhere.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.720
 I'm really enjoying this.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.000

 Did you know your eyes are 98% water at the surface?

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:47.760
 When you're supplementing a dehydration of dry eye, what is dry eye?

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:52.240
 It's a lack of water, dehydration of the water at the surface of the eye.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.400
 Well, listen to our sponsor with Nature's Tears Eye Mist, and we'll be right back with

 That's Sharon Kleiner Hour at Yahoo.com.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.720
 Now, back to the program.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:50.920
 Dr. Peat, you have spent a lot of time studying progesterone and the hormones, and I've been

00:35:50.920 --> 00:36:00.480
 reading here about your valuations on the effects of estrogen, radiation stress, and

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:06.480
 lack of oxygen, which I believe dehydration causes stress.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:14.840
 Could you explain to us and talk to the audience that they need to be educated about the progesterone

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:22.360
 and the hormones, as if they don't really understand how they function?

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:33.000
 The organism, the structure is mainly a system of protein molecules, and fat and nucleic

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 acids, DNA, and those things are in a way peripheral to the basic protein structure.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:52.080
 The protein changes its electrical properties according to the chemical reactions going

00:36:52.080 --> 00:37:01.560
 on inside, and it can change its acidity or alkalinity according to the metabolism and

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.120
 what you're eating.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:14.520
 And ordinary, like a sponge or a bowl of Jell-O, any system with a lot of protein in it will

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:22.880
 change the way it holds water according to the degree of acidity and alkalinity.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.000
 Acidity makes it give up water.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:38.120
 Acidity makes it retain water, and the protein itself is on the acidic side, but it associates

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:48.120
 with alkaline metals like sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, and these neutralize

00:37:48.120 --> 00:38:00.000
 the acidity of the proteins and the metabolism of basically burning sugar in the presence

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.380
 of oxygen.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:11.200
 That energy is what regulates the balance of acidity and alkalinity, and in turn, it's

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:17.200
 the alkalinity essentially that makes the organism retain water.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:33.880
 And edema, where your feet or fingers swell up, that is regulated as a result of bad metabolism

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:41.840
 letting your hormones get out of balance, changing the acidity and alkalinity of the

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:48.400
 whole organism so that instead of the water staying inside cells where it belongs, it

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:56.720
 falls out of cells and collects in your feet and fingers or whatever is downhill under

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.560
 gravity.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:10.360
 And the hormone that is most responsible for keeping the cells hydrated and functional,

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:16.560
 demonstrating the processes that Albert St. George went around the country demonstrating

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:25.160
 in lectures with fluorescent lights showing that the muscle would become luminous when

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:30.720
 it contracted and dark when it was relaxed.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:40.320
 These changes in the state of water are constantly being regulated mainly by the thyroid hormone

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:49.840
 letting us use oxygen to produce energy, and the thyroid maintains the protective hormones

00:39:49.840 --> 00:40:01.640
 such as progesterone, pregnenolone, testosterone, DHEA, and under stress or injury, some of

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:12.720
 the testosterone or DHEA changes in the estrogen which changes the ability to regulate water.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:23.520
 It tends to create the edema state, but the edema reverses the functional state of the

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:33.640
 organism momentarily to put it back into a growth condition so that it can renew the

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.640
 cells.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.760
 That's its function.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:43.500
 Once a month, there should be a surge of estrogen in a woman's tissues to prepare her for pregnancy

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:52.280
 and lactation, but if the estrogen persists too long, then the water is out of control

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:59.160
 throughout the organism and it tends to cause the swelling, headaches, nervous tension,

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:08.240
 swollen feet, and so on associated with premenstrual syndrome or pregnancy problems and so on.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:15.720
 Thyroid and progesterone are the most powerful hormones in preserving the proper retention

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:20.760
 of water in cells, not too much, not too little.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:25.680
 Now on young people, I've always used this as an example.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.920
 The moment the baby left its mother's womb in the pocket of water, we entered in the

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:38.080
 air we live in, and that's water vapor humidity and the influences of that from there on.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.880
 There's no moisture meter today like they have blood pressure checks yet.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:49.000
 I hope to gosh we can do one someday and decide what is happening by checking that out regularly,

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.360
 what is happening in the body, and what you have just said is that the individual, how

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:59.240
 does an individual know this is all happening?

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:05.200
 The aging process is essentially a loss of water.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:14.280
 A baby has an extremely high water content in its tissues, 80 something percent I think,

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:24.960
 and a very old person gets down approaching maybe 55 percent, and the function decreases

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:31.620
 along with the water so that a baby has an extremely high metabolic rate and ability

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:35.480
 to heal tissues.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:47.960
 At puberty, the resistance, health, vitality, everything is at a maximum, and after that

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.740
 everything tends to go downhill.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:58.040
 The ability to heal gradually decreases with aging, but all along the water content of

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:07.080
 the tissue right from conception to death, it's a decreasing percentage of water inside

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.080
 every cell.

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:16.200
 We've talked about water, and you've got to know a lot to help our listeners understand.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:21.240
 We were talking about the acidity of the body and the alkaline that is so important.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.880
 Tell us about what you've been learning about nutrition.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:32.640
 Here in America, all over the world, their nutrition habits were based on founders of

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.640
 taste.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:40.760
 What is to you the best nutrition to help retain the water, to detoxify the body, and

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:49.960
 keep a real gradual dehydration of the body that's healthy so the person will not age

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.720
 too quickly and be healthier?

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.720
 Tell us some of it.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.760
 What did you learn about nutrition?

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:05.240
 There were some studies about 20 or 30 years ago in which if you feed the animal or even

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:13.480
 the tissue in a dish, if you feed it saturated fats such as coconut oil, the cells of the

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:23.720
 skin grow in an orderly way, retaining their moisture, keeping the skin plump, firm, and

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.840
 resilient.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:34.320
 If you feed them polyunsaturated fats, they mature very quickly as if under the influence

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:41.640
 of a vitamin A deficiency or estrogen excess.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.880
 They're more susceptible to sun damage.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:55.520
 The cells grow slowly and in irregular columns and the skin overall is thinner.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:45:05.240
 So the sun damage and too much polyunsaturated fat in the diet makes the skin age and become

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:08.920
 disorganized prematurely.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:16.400
 That got me interested in coconut oil and about 20 years ago I started writing about

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.880
 the biological effects of increasing...

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.520
 What about coconut water?

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.640
 I studied it a little bit too.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:32.360
 It's a great source of minerals and if it's fresh, it has very good sugar and the sugar

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:42.920
 oxidizes, produces carbon dioxide and the carbon dioxide is the main power in regulating

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:46.960
 the alkalinity of cells.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:56.160
 That's what moves minerals in and out of cells and through your kidneys and so on.

00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:08.520
 The fruit, orange juice is an ideal source of carbohydrate because it has its own minerals

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:13.360
 with it, the same as coconut water.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:18.640
 Coconut is a good food, cheese because of the high minerals.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.640
 You're not anti-dairy.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.960
 Your research hasn't proven anything about being anti-dairy.

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:32.280
 No, because of the high value of the calcium content and the low ratio of phosphate to

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:37.440
 calcium because phosphate is an age accelerating thing.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:47.840
 So a diet high in meat and nuts for example has a serious excess of phosphate and a deficiency

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.360
 of calcium.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:59.840
 Calcium is one of the best things for stimulating the rate of metabolism and preventing obesity.

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:08.960
 People who drink milk regularly are a very slim population in proportion to the amount

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.960
 of calories they consume.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:18.400
 And there have been a couple of studies in which dementia is much higher in populations

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:23.720
 that don't drink any milk.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:32.400
 Now I also want to ask you about aging eyes, infant eyes, and you've done a lot of research

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.760
 on that and the lungs.

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.840
 Tell us about what you were learning about eyes because that's been a field I've been

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:46.080
 involved with now for ten years with research about the eyes and what's happening with the

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:51.000
 environment and exposures with the environment today.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:48:02.320
 I especially got interested in how the transparency of the cornea, lens, and vitreous humor, how

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.400
 that works.

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:11.800
 When I was in Mexico at Lake Pátzcuaro, the fish there are transparent, at least they

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:12.800
 used to be.

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.280
 I think pollution is changing it.

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:26.200
 But in the market they would pile up fish that were the size of small trouts and even

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:31.720
 some eight inches long, others about the size of a cigar.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:40.860
 You could read a magazine cover right through the fish, absolute transparency.

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:50.680
 That got me interested in the issue of what makes the sclera, the cornea, or the lens

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:55.320
 able to be transparent even though it has relatively little water.

00:48:55.320 --> 00:49:00.480
 It's a very tough, hard, rubbery tissue.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:10.320
 The state of the water is so organized and you have to think about Gerald Pollack's research

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:15.560
 to think about what organization can mean to water.

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:26.840
 The molecules are lined up such that the quantum energy is organized as it moves through.

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:38.040
 There's another very important website, May Wan Ho, her last name is just Ho, called I

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:44.280
 think it's ISIS, Institute for Science.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:53.200
 She writes about the coherence of organisms involving this quantum level organization

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.240
 of water molecules.

00:49:55.240 --> 00:50:06.080
 She has illustrations of the color continuity right through a whole organism showing that

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:16.880
 the light has to be organized by the organism as a whole, not by individual random atoms.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:23.560
 In the lens and the cornea, what this means is that if, for example, you have too much

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:34.440
 inflammation, too much estrogen, too much ultraviolet radiation, anything that excites

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:41.560
 the tissue too much, it lets the water get disorganized.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:48.480
 The water content increases just the way edema causes water to accumulate in your feet or

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.520
 fingers where it shouldn't be.

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:58.600
 The water accumulates in a loose form and that's what causes the opacity of a cataract.

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:04.920
 It's actually too much water because it's out of control and disorganized.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:15.280
 Do you think that's because of the dehydration of the atmospheric influence of the eye, being

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.280
 dehydrating too quickly?

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:24.720
 We've been learning that if there's too much water, it's because the water is dehydrating

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:28.160
 too quickly.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:32.120
 The proteins are dehydrating.

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:37.160
 They are losing the control of the water.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:46.920
 The living substance has lost its water and the water is accumulating basically in random

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:47.920
 places.

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:51.600
 You can help me with this one.

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:58.120
 I've been studying that if the body is swelling, it's trying to hold back on its loss of water.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:02.080
 It's dehydrating too quickly.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:07.720
 As you said, the eyes and the brain are connected in the womb at the same time.

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:16.600
 The brain being an estimated 80% water and the eyes at the surface and the tear film

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.680
 aqueous layer about 98% water.

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:25.880
 If it's overreacting, the water is dehydrating too quickly.

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:31.600
 And then with the carbohydrates that we're talking about and fats in the food, the cells

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.600
 are getting...

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.840
 I'm very blunt about this.

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:41.840
 The toxin in the cell is getting too heated and you can correct me and I call that almost

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:42.840
 a manure.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.040
 It cannot expel.

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.040
 It cannot detoxify.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.680
 It's heating up.

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.600
 Now you can correct me or help me with that.

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:54.840
 The age pigment is involved.

00:52:54.840 --> 00:53:00.800
 That's what you see accumulating in spots on old people's skin.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:10.080
 But it starts anytime the tissue isn't getting enough oxygen to retain its water the way

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.320
 it should.

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:22.040
 The polyunsaturated fats become oxidized and form clumps of this dark orange or brown or

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.080
 black pigment.

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:31.080
 And this wastes oxygen and creates a vicious circle.

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:36.120
 So it's definitely junk accumulating in cells.

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:42.840
 But with enough energy, progesterone and thyroid, for example, can energize the cell enough

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:45.680
 to reverse that age pigment.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:55.680
 But it helps greatly if you use things like milk, orange juice, coconut water and coconut

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.800
 oil are good.

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.440
 Not definitely not the thing...

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:03.160
 We're out of time but I need to ask you.

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:09.000
 The first thing that came to my mind just now is you're living in Eugene, Oregon where

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:15.280
 the University of Oregon football team with Chip Kelly was well-known in the past few

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:23.440
 years that he really worked with his team on the science of health as a behavior and

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:28.280
 nutrition and sleep and attitude.

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.280
 Were you hired by him?

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.280
 No.

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:37.640
 Because everything you're saying is exactly what everybody...

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:40.800
 I call it the health Olympics, doctor.

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:45.760
 We used to get out of bed every day and be in the health Olympics.

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:49.960
 But what would you like to say to the audience?

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.480
 You definitely have done so much.

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:54.720
 We've only got about half a minute left.

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.080
 What would you like to say to the audience worldwide on what you think you're going to

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.640
 be learning?

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.720
 There's so much on the Internet.

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:12.320
 If you look at websites like Vandana Shiva and Gerald Pollack and Martin Chaplin has

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:18.960
 a great water website, many pages of very detailed information.

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:26.280
 You can get information that your doctor won't know for a hundred years.

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.280
 And then go to yours.

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.280
 It's www.RayPeat.com.

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:38.800
 While we're out of time, I enjoyed it and I know the world out there did too, Dr. Peat.

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.200
 I hope I can have you back on someday because in the future when you have a moment because

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.760
 there's so much more that I could have had you discuss today.

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.560
 But we really did learn a lot.

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:54.520
 I thank you so much for all you've done, your commitment and don't back off of the medical

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:55.520
 field.

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:56.520
 I know they're coming.

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:59.840
 Okay, thank you.

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:00.840
 Thank you.

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:01.840
 You have a nice day.

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:02.840
 Bye.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.840
 Bye.

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.880
 Well, we're out of time and I have to close.

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:11.520
 But I want to thank Pauli Featherton for getting Dr. Ray Peat.

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:17.040
 I think that's always going to be one of our most exciting educational shows.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.240
 I know that you should embrace your life.

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.360
 You're in the Health Olympics and embrace somebody else's.

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.920
 The earth is whispering to us every moment of the day.

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:30.360
 Do not take it all with you.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.240
 Leave something behind of yourself.

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.120
 It's so important.

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.760
 And I want to thank you for listening.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.680
 I appreciate every one of our guests.

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.040
 I'm sure you will too.

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:45.400
 And I want you to have a nice day.

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:46.760
 Think of the water.

00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:49.000
 Drink your water and think about your health.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.340
 You're in the Health Olympics with all of us.

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:52.400
 Thank you for listening.

00:56:52.400 --> 00:57:07.400
 You have a nice day and you be well.

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.400
 Thank you for listening.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.880
