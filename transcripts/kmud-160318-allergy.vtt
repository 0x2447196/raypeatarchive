 [Music]

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Well, welcome to the show and once again you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor, KMUD Garboval, 91.1 FM.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 My name is Andrew Murray and for those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Both my wife and I, who's not here this evening, we're both licensed medical herbalists and we graduated in England with a master's degree in herbal medicine

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 and we see and advise clients with a wide range of conditions with herbal and dietary advice as well as lifestyle change advice.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Okay, so you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor, KMUD Garboval, 91.1 FM and fortunately Dr. Peat is joining us again this month for the show's topic

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 which will be broadly encompassing allergy as a fairly pertinent time of year. Things are just starting to flower, the clocks have gone forward, we're on summertime.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Things are flowering and soon the grasses will be flowering, although that's just not the only source of allergy-related effects, but there obviously are plenty of other allergies, both food and environmental.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 So once again we're very welcome to welcome Dr. Peat on the show who's going to share his insights into the mechanisms of allergy

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 and as always you probably won't have heard some of what he's going to say related to the explanation for allergies because it's fairly new material.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 In fact some of it's very old material, it just hasn't been accepted, but Dr. Peat's break on rationale on the subject of allergies is both fascinating and insightful.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 So thanks so much for joining us again Dr. Peat.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Yeah, hi.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 For those people who have perhaps have never tuned into the show or never read your newsletters or maybe haven't heard of you,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 would you just outline your academic and professional background before we get going with the show?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 After I had studied humanities and linguistics for a while and taught linguistics,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 I decided to study biology and spent four years, 1968 to '72, studying for a PhD at the University of Oregon.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 In 1969 I attended their international immunology conference and seeing some of the most famous immunologists in the world,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 I became skeptical of the standard theories of immunity because they were really ignoring some of the papers that were given at that conference

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 in favor of staying with the stereotyped official dogma.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Okay.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Alright, well that's a good introduction.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 I know that you're extremely talented and you've done a lot of work over many decades here now of your own research,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 looking at the reality of the science behind cause and effect.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 And I know that you've written a lot of material on your own website,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 giving people free access to some of the explanations that you've given and some of which have been borne out in mainstream science recently.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 So that's good news that it's gradually getting out there.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 For those people that are listening, I just wanted also to highlight the fact that from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 you're both invited and welcome to call in with any questions either related to this month's topic of allergy or other subjects if you have them.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 If we can try and stick on the topic of allergy, that would probably be best.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 So the number if you live in the area is a 707 number, it's 923-3911.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Or if fortunately you're outside of the state of California and you wanted to call in from the East Coast or the Midwest,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 we often get people calling in from those places.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 So that's great to hear you all out there and I know even people in different parts of the world have tuned in.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 There's a toll-free number which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD, which is 1-800-568-3723.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 For people listening, they can also tune into the web version of KMUD.org and listen to the live broadcast on the air now.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 So Dr. Peat, I think just starting off with some of the kind of medical model of allergy,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 what I've been reading and what I've understood previously from my background is that IgE is the main mediated product as an antibody product

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 that causes the recognition and the reactive processes that lead to inflammation.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 What do you see of IgE as the main cause or do you not even agree with that?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 I think one of the reasons that it gets so much attention is that it fit with a hereditary idea of susceptibility to allergy and other diseases.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 I think the facts are that it's as much an effect of allergy as it is a cause.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 For example, it's known that the determination of the B cells or bone-derived white blood cells to make the IgE type of antibody,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 it's determined by the signals in the body and histamine is the immediate, probably the most effective signal in telling the B cells to start making the IgE antibody.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 So if you don't have inflammation from the stressed cells producing histamine, you won't be likely to have so much IgE.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 One of the things that turns on the production of more mast cells or the secretion or leakage of histamine from the mast cells

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 is prostaglandins produced from the polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially prostaglandin E2.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 Over the last 15 or 20 years, several researchers have seen that allergic women have babies that are born with higher polyunsaturated fatty acid content

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 and that those babies are more likely to develop allergies at an early age.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 The polyunsaturated fats tend to decrease the low-density so-called bad cholesterol and increase the HDL, high-density type of cholesterol.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 The HDL is associated with allergy and the higher LDL is associated with less likelihood of allergy.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 PUFA and HDL, the supposedly good things, which have been increasingly promoted,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 are believed by quite a few allergists now to be responsible for the great increase in allergy in Europe and America.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Because they're signaling for inflammation.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Yeah, they increase the, among other things, the prostaglandins, which increase the histamine production.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Okay, so you mentioned the prostaglandins when you first started talking about the IgE antibodies,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 they kind of go through a signaling process.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 So these free fatty acids, these are very self-same free fatty acids that you often talk about as being important to keep down

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 because they're both inflammatory and destructive in their inflammatory mechanisms.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Yeah, besides making the prostaglandins in themselves, they cause changes in cells that disrupt their functions.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 In fact, every function of the cell can be disrupted by too much of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 And one of the worst things they do is to interrupt oxidative metabolism.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 And the energy deficit, I think, is ultimately the thing that leads to the really serious allergy problems.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Now, when you talk about energy production, again, I'm automatically thinking of the mitochondrial powerhouse of the cell

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 producing energy and thyroid and progesterone being those pro-supportive supplements, nutrients for it.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 That's the correct way of thinking about it.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Yeah, and babies and very young children can oxidize fatty acids very quickly and get good energy from them.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 But in proportion to how unsaturated they are, they over the years slow down the ability to oxidize anything.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 And sugar doesn't do that.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 Glucose doesn't cause the great problems with metabolism and energy production.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 OK, so there's a kind of cumulative effect with free fatty acid buildup in the body that leads to a decrease in energy.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 And that energy decrease is responsible in part for the arrival on the scene of the inflammatory mediators that usually poorly, poorly, poorly started.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 They're triggered by things which normally people wouldn't be susceptible to or allergic to.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 I think this is some of the rationale for why people get unexplained so-called allergies.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 And I know as we get into the energy production side of your rationale on that, on allergies, we'll come up with some good ways to stave off that process.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Yeah, about 40 or 50 years ago, some people associated with Hans Celia in Canada did research on allergy and the shock that can be produced by allergens.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 And in one of their studies, they graded allergens from the potentially deadly walnut oil allergy down to very mild allergies like pollen that would maybe cause the sniffles.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 And they gave that range of allergens to animals that had glucose infused into their bloodstream to give them twice to three times the normal concentration of glucose.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 And even the most deadly allergen didn't do anything worse than maybe give them the sniffles when they had high blood sugar.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 But if they gave them a little insulin to lower their blood sugar, the mildest allergen could kill them with anaphylactic shock.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 Got it. Okay, so sugar is a good mediator then. It's almost a stress reducing substance that prevents that cascade from even occurring then.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 Yeah, lots of people have been able to give up their EpiPens or their epinephrine dosers just by keeping a Coke on hand.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 If they are stung by a bee that they're allergic to or such, they drink a Coke quickly.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 I find it so interesting that the industry wants to demonize all those things that have been shown time and time again to be beneficial for people.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 So I know, I think I read today on while I was scanning the internet, trolling for different pieces of information and going through some of the stuff that I was going to discuss with you today.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 I'm sure I came across an article about sugar tax that they're now imposing in England.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. I know it's a little bit of the subject here.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Anyway, sugar is very important, not just in terms of energy production, but for vitalizing the cell.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 And it's also that same sugar then they're saying, which is directly responsible for directly reducing the inflammation.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Yeah. When you increase, like in these animals, when you give them extra glucose, it's able to get around the polyunsaturated fatty acid interference with energy production.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 It can turn off the production of fatty acids and get directly to the mitochondria to produce energy.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Yeah. I think when most people think about sugar, they've probably been told by mainstream media how bad it is and what your glucose should be and hear about all the diabetes that's rampant now as a means or a reason not to consume sugar.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 But we all know that the cause for diabetes is nothing to do with sugar.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 And we've gone over various radio shows talking about the high fructose corn syrup in the industry's food chain and how that, along with the polyunsaturated, are directly responsible for the rise in diabetes.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 So sugar itself, in terms of the sugar that would be necessary, I wonder if you know, if you remember the work or the articles about the amount of sugar.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 You said two to three times what would be normally present as an average blood glucose.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 Yeah. 300 milligrams per cent was the protective, completely protective level.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 Yeah. Interesting. OK. Well, you're listening to Ask Your Ob Doctor. K.M.U.D.Gal before 91.1 FM.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 From 7.30 till the end of the show, callers are invited to call in with questions about this month's subject of allergy.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 We've come to that time of year now, March, with the clocks going forward and everything breaking into flower.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 Where people are probably going to start coming down with the things that they recognize as the start of spring.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 So there's going to be plenty of advice here to understand the mechanisms by which allergy occur and how best to deal with it from a nutrition point of view.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 I guess the underlying pathophysiology of allergy involves the immunoregulatory dysfunction, then, similar to those that's been noted in highly stressed populations.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 And we'll get into the stress side here in a moment.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 So the allergies themselves have been considered psychosomatic and they've worsened outcomes in patients with a high degree of psychosocial stress.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 How do you see the cause effect aspect of stress modulating the allergy response?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Remember we were talking about learned helplessness? Stress that you can't escape from, even if it's not a very deadly stress.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 The forced swimming test of the rats.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 It becomes deadly and that's because you can't mobilize the anti-stress system. You get stuck in the cholinergic or parasympathetic side of the system, which tends to weaken and slow your heartbeat and weaken other defenses.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 But it puts you in a predisposed to become inflamed condition.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 And when they've looked at people with various inflammatory diseases, it turns out that their social economic status is additive to any particular learned helplessness situation.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 So that a person with any bad condition is less likely to survive if they have a low social economic status.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 But if they have overcome learned helplessness, they can also overcome their social economic status.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 They're simply additive so that learned helplessness plus low status, low income makes you very susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, dementia and so on.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 I wonder how best people could overcome that by either reading stimulating articles or being involved in discussion dialogue about alternatives that could be helpful.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 I wonder that most people that have that poor situation where they are very much economically deprived, etc. have a, like you say, a kind of downward spiral mental outlook on things.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Yeah, an enriched environment is how they made animals overcome it. And in humans, anything that gets you out of the trapped sensation that makes your life interesting.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 So just about any life enriching experience, meeting new people, going new places, helps break out of those patterns.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Okay, from a direct descriptive term then for allergies, for people that are, for example, allergic to pollen.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 I know pollen is just one of many different allergens that can trigger an allergy response.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 But in terms of some of the best treatment or some of the best approaches to this type of allergy mediated substance, what do you think would be probably some of the most important advice people could get for combating allergies?

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 It turns out that the same things that cure or help to escape from learned helplessness also help to stop or reduce the inflammatory reaction and reduce histamine production.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 And T3, the active form of thyroid hormone, was one of the early things they discovered would cure learned helplessness. And it does several things that prevent overproduction of histamine.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 It's been known to be anti-inflammatory for a long time, but one of its mechanisms is to stabilize mast cells so they don't secrete serotonin, histamine, and other inflammatory things.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Okay. Alright, so how about, we've talked in the past about you are what you eat.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 And then at this point in time, we're talking about ingesting allergens, so potentially you can be triggered into inflammation by what you either purposely or inadvertently ingest.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 So what perhaps is a rationale, or your rationale then, for the gut-derived link between inhaled allergens and allergy that can be decreased by specifically treating the gut with anti-inflammatories?

00:20:48.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Sometimes the inflammation in a particular area, like in your nose, or ears, or throat, or eyes, sometimes that's really something irritating your intestine.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 You can develop the IgE antibodies solely in your nasal membranes without having it in your general bloodstream, so you can have a local reaction to pollen or such.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 But I think usually people who are getting these throat-nose inflammations, it's usually started from something happening in the intestine, triggering mast cells, which are very numerous in the lining of the intestine,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 triggering the production of histamine, serotonin, nitric oxide, and other things systemically, prostaglandins in particular.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 And those circulate to cause all membranes. They can cause hives of lumps on the skin and other skin conditions.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 And so avoiding things that feed bacteria so that you don't produce so much endotoxin can help all types of allergy and inflammatory conditions.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 And the standard theory of allergy is they used to say that only a protein is a potential allergen. But there's just perfect evidence that many things that don't contain proteins are very powerful, potentially deadly allergens.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 For example, the alginate that dentists use for making molds of the mouth.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 Did you say alginate?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 Alginate.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 Yeah, right.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 It's a cousin of carotenoids, which is now in so many foods.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 Right.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 One person died of anaphylactic shock from having a mold made with alginate.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 So allergic were they, huh?

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 Yeah, it's a polysaccharide, but lots of gums like guar and locust gum and xanthan gum and so on.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 These are all allergens for some people, but they're used just almost indiscriminately in food.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 Today someone sent me a label for an ice cream substitute that contains seven different gums, one of which is an allergen for some people.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 Do you think that this food-based dietary involvement of allergic responses could be additive in any way where people just get worse and worse because their diet doesn't change and the insults just continue to come on in?

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Yeah, I think this is probably the worst cause of learned helplessness in the biological sense.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Your body experiences that inflammatory state, which is psychological as much as biological.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 It's so insidious, too.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 It's so all-pervasive and all so insidious.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 It's a pretty corporate machine that's being driven, I think, down the path of destruction for a lot of people in a lot of ways.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 But that's why I know you advocate so many good whole – not whole foods as in the whole food store – but so many good whole food approaches to diet.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 I know that your mainstay foods of choice and preference here are things like good quality dairy products, whether it's milk or cheese.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Yeah, the calcium and vitamin D are two of the things that are very strongly anti-allergic.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 Magnesium is the most famous because a magnesium deficiency, they found, caused a terrific range of inflammatory diseases in animals.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 And they were – they could cure skin diseases, heart disease, nerve disease, liver disease, and so on just by correcting a magnesium deficiency.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 But vitamin D and calcium working with magnesium are very important so that some people cure their allergies just by supplementing vitamin D or vitamin K, which is the other major calcium-regulating vitamin.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 Okay. Let's hold that thought there for a minute because we do actually have a call on the air.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 So let's just open up the show to callers and let's see where this first call is going.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 Caller, you're on the air?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 Yes, hello. This is David from Missouri.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 Oh, hey, David. What's your question?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 Okay. I think this is still on target, but I've wondered about this for quite a while.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Do you think there's some kind of confusion that's been going on for a long time regarding the common cold and it actually being in the same category as an allergy?

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 For instance, you look at what happens around Christmas or the holidays.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 You've got people that have reduced sunlight. They're eating extremely unhealthy food.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 They're stressed out. And all of a sudden, everybody's getting the cold.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 Sounds like a perfect recipe.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 I'm just wondering – we also see this happen throughout the year where people are labeling something a cold or they're confused.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 They even seem confused as to do I have an allergy or do I have a cold?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 And the other thing I want to ask in relation to that, which I think covers both subjects of allergies and the cold, is why is mucus always a major part of either one of those?

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 Is that the body's intelligence trying to throw off the allergens?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Is it like a vehicle being used to try to exit things?

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 Yeah, mucus binds histamine and keeps it away from the cells and binds other toxins and irritants.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 So it's our first line of defense, both against allergens and viruses and such.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 But I think there is a great similarity between the variety of viruses that like to attack the intestine.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 Things that we think of as respiratory viruses, I think, are primarily intestinal viruses.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 Polio in one of its manifestations was really just a gastrointestinal infection.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 But the famous gastroenterologist, Walter Alvarez, about 80 years ago, experimented on dogs.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 And when he would give them a respiratory virus, he found that they would get a runny nose and inflammation in their head without any virus at all present in their nose.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 And he found that the virus was growing in their intestine and producing symptoms in their upper respiratory system.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 And then later, if they didn't throw it off, later the virus would show up all through their system, including their nose.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 So what seems to be a nose cold, I think, most often is irritation in the intestine.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 And I've seen dozens of people who learned that at the first sign of a cold coming on, such as a sore throat or runny nose, if they ate a carrot, they could break the pattern and not develop the cold.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 Is the common cold considered to be a virus or a germ?

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 It's supposed to be a virus, right?

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 Yeah.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 And so I've always thought this is interesting, too, especially after learning everything I have from you, Dr. Peat, that doctors are prescribing antibiotics, even though for a long time I was always irritated with family members going ahead and going to the doctor when they had a bad cold and getting antibiotics.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 And I would say, hey, it's a virus.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 So why are you doing that?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 Why is the doctor doing that?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 And they always said that it was because of a secondary infection.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 But in reality, based on what we've been learning from you, it actually may be a good thing to do because it's attacking that endotoxin issue in the intestine.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Is that correct?

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 Yeah, I think so.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 And you usually don't need nearly the dose that is typically prescribed to clear out a bowel infection if it has just come on.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Sometimes a third of the standard dose of penicillin or tetracycline or erythromycin will clear it up.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 And then antihistamines that are stifling the mucus flow in a way are really kind of disrupting the intelligence of the body getting these allergens out.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Is that correct?

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Except sometimes they can break the pattern.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 Like vitamin E has antihistamine effect.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 For example, it prevents the formation of prostaglandins and as a consequence will prevent the degranulation of mast cells.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 And so it can prevent the shift to the IgE antibody in the whole thing.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 You're saying the histamine is creating a vicious cycle, so we do want to break that cycle?

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 Yeah, breaking the cycle.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 Even various antihistamines and other drugs can help to break that cycle.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 And you said before that nitric acid is also kind of a vicious loop going between histamine and nitric acid.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 I think you mean nitric oxide, don't you?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Histamine turns on the production of nitric oxide and nitric oxide signals a bunch of other inflammatory processes.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 But the worst thing is that it interferes with oxygen energy production.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 Okay. So the mucus flowing, though, is probably a good thing, but it may be a part of that vicious cycle, I guess, that we would like to stop.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Yeah, the mucus itself is fine. It's helpful.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 But you wouldn't have to produce it if you didn't have the inflammation.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Okay, there we go. That's what I was looking for. Okay.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 Okay, well, hey, thank you.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 Yeah, thank you for your call.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 Okay, well, we do have two more callers, and I just want to let other people listening know, from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 you're invited to call in with questions related or unrelated to this month's topic of allergy, local areas, 707-923-3911.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 Well, there's an 800 number for people living in a different state, across the states, or outside of this area, toll number, the 707 number.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 It's 800-568-3723.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 So we have two more callers. Let's take this next caller.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 Caller, where are you from, and what's your question?

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 Hi, I'm Christina from the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Hey, Christina, what's your question?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 Before I ask my question, I first just want to thank Dr. Peat.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Dr. Peat, you've absolutely changed my life through Dr. Murray, who I've been consulting with over the past year.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 My hair has gotten thicker, my energy has increased, anxiety and depression have tremendously improved,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 and so I just want to thank you both, Dr. Peat and Dr. Murray, for all that you do.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 Awesome.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 The two quick questions I have is I've been experiencing terrible allergies for the past month,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 and noticed that my symptoms dramatically flare up right when I go to sleep.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 Like it's very difficult for me to fall asleep.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 And do you know why that happens?

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 That's the first question.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 The second question is what do you recommend I do to alleviate those symptoms?

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 Yeah, I think it's because that's when the parasympathetic system kicks in and lowers your blood sugar,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 and that combination turns on the histamine release and inflammation.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 And I experimented, I had a pattern of sleep onset asthma,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 and I found that gymsin weed or atropine, the belladonna type chemical,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 breaks the muscarinic part of the parasympathetic reaction,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 and I found that that would keep me from going into that very low blood sugar state.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 But the trouble with relying on the anticholinergic is that it tends to dry your mouth

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 and gives you tooth decay from the absence of saliva flow during the night.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 So it is an emergency treatment, but the real thing I think is to adjust your thyroid and progesterone.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Progesterone has a broad variety of antihistamine effects.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 Estrogen turns on both the multiplication of mast cells and their tendency to release histamine and serotonin.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 And so getting your thyroid to a good level will reduce your estrogen and increase your progesterone

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 and shift the balance in histamine production.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 Aspirin is another antihistamine that works indirectly by reducing prostaglandin production

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 and nitric oxide production and such.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 You could easily take three, say, 325 milligram tablets in a day.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 I know some people take considerably more than that,

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 and in conjunction with vitamin K, one drop per 325 milligram tablet,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 if it's a one mil per drop vitamin K2 solution,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 is adequate to offset any potential hemorrhagic or hemodynamic effects of blood thinning that some individuals may get.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 It's relatively rare.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 So 900 milligrams a day, that would be a fairly--

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 for people that were suffering with allergies, that would also be quite a good approach to self-treatment.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 I think so, and sometimes just taking 300 to 500 milligrams before bedtime

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 so that it has time to get absorbed before you actually start falling asleep.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 Sorry, there was another part of your question, I think, that you--

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 Those were actually-- both of them.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 I do have another one, but I can let the next person have a chance.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 Well, what's your next question? Now's your opportunity.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 My old naturopathic doctor told me that I was getting eczema flare-ups as a result of eating eggs,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 and surprisingly, although I know that you mentioned, Dr. Preet, on this show many times that eggs are good for you,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 surprisingly, eczema still comes back when I eat eggs, and I get kind of a migraine after I eat eggs.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 It's a headache that really hurts.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 So what do you think causes that?

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 Yeah, I've had that reaction many times to-- liver is the other good food that can cause that reaction,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 but when you're tending to have the high histamine or parasympathetic dominance,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 a dose of very high-quality protein powerfully stimulates insulin production and drops your blood sugar,

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 and so it's the same reaction that happens when you go to sleep.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 Your parasympathetic system lets inflammation develop,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 and so I learned to never eat more than one egg per class of--

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 10-ounce class of sweet orange juice, at least that much to balance the protein in one egg.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 Wow, that makes sense, because I've been eating two eggs and just a little bit of orange juice,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 so I'll try that. Thank you so much.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Okay, you're welcome. All right, so let's take the next caller.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 Hi there, this is Coleman. I'm from Garberville.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 Oh, hey, Coleman. Go ahead. What's your question?

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 Thank you very much for this wonderful program,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 and thank you for the graciousness of the lady that just spoke being ready to get off the phone,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 and the guy from MO might listen.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 I'm interested because you were talking about anaphylactic shock and how sugar could help,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 and I used to carry Sudafed in my truck glove compartment because I was paranoid about rattlesnakes,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 and I understood that that was a possible use, you know, on the way to getting help.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 Is sugar also something that could help in that regard? Thank you very much.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 Yeah, I would think so. Dr. Peat, what's your take on that?

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 Yeah, having a Coca-Cola or Pepsi I think would work,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 but most people I know have had Coca-Cola work.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 A 12-ounce glass contains, I forget, but it's like 8 teaspoons or more, 8% glucose, sugar.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 Okay. And I think it's mostly the sugar, but the caffeine contributes to the same thing,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 helping to keep your blood sugar up.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 And ephedra is more powerful than caffeine, but working in the same direction.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Okay. Talking about ephedra, Dr. Peat, thanks for that caller.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 Ephedra used to be a par excellence herb for asthma.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 I used to use a lot of ephedra, and unfortunately it got abused

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 and withdrawn from the marketplace probably 10 years ago now.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 But as a stimulant and for reducing the effects of inflammation and allergies,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 do you think that it was its sympathetic drive or some antihistamine quality that it had

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 that was responsible for it?

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 I think they're all the same thing.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 The pharmacologists like to talk about specific receptors being activated and so on,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 but there's just an extreme overlap, the same way the steroid hormones,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 all of them overlap either positively or negatively.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 The benzadrine, amphetamine, ephedra, dopamine, adrenaline, diphenhydramine,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 cyproheptadine, all of these things that are--

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 they have different names and categories, but they all have a good antihistamine,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 pro-blood sugar, pro-respiratory effect.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 Okay. Just a shame that they've been maligned because of some of their tachycardic

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 or hypertensive effects, I think, in the extreme.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 I think that's probably one of the main reasons that ephedra was pulled from the market.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 I think people doing long-distance truck driving, etc., were abusing it to stay awake,

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 and I think there were some incidences of, oh, I don't know, probably stroke in some people

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 or high blood pressure in others that caused them to pull it off the market.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 Do you know if there's any of those sympathetic stimulants that maybe don't have such a stimulant effect

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 to change blood pressure or pulse rate but would still have an antihistamine effect

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 and had a different mechanism of activity?

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 The currently popular alternative that's legal is one that's produced in the brain,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 but it's a close relative of dopamine and adrenaline.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 It's called phenethylamine, P-E-A.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 Okay, phenethylamine.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 People, again, are talking about 500 to 1,000 or 1,500 milligram doses, which I think are crazy.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 I think a helpful dose would be maybe 5 or 10 milligrams.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 Okay, and that doesn't have a stimulant effect on the cardiovascular or the...

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 Well, I think it wouldn't with those tremendous, crazy doses.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 At 500 milligrams, it probably would.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 Okay, well, you're listening to Ask Your Rev. Dr. K. M. Udgav, 91.1 FM.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 From now till the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with questions

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 either related to allergy or allergy-related subjects or unrelated.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 The numbers, if you live in the area, 707-923-3911, or there's an 800 number, which is 1-800-568-3723.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 You can use the call in between now and about 5 to 8.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 Well, Dr. Peat, I wanted to get on to the other subject related to allergies.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 It's the topic of atopic dermatitis.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 I know I've known several people with chronic dermatitis that's basically gone on to become severe, eczema, weeping.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 And I read the article where in...

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 And this is one of those PubMed articles that they've found 95% of people that have atopic dermatitis,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 chronic atopic dermatitis, get colonized with Staph aureus.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 And that's Staphylococcal aureus bacteria that produces the yellow pus and becomes responsible for the kind of boil-type appearance of the broken skin of the dermatitis.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 That is actually being used, the anti-stress method that we've mentioned earlier on as a cause for allergy reducing stress.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 But not only that, but you piqued my interest when you were talking about vitamin D.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 And vitamin D is being responsible for anti-allergy.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 And then again with magnesium and magnesium deficiency and how thyroid basically stabilizes magnesium in the body.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 Do you think atopic dermatitis is something that can be treated through the gut in the same way that you think allergies can?

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 Yeah, the gut and the skin have some antigens and enzymes that are so closely connected that when one is inflamed, the other one gets inflamed.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 And thyroid and vitamin D are the most common solutions to those hypersensitivity of gut and skin.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 Okay, so we talked about environmental enrichment now as a way of changing the tide as it were against inflammation.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 I think we'll pick that up just after this next caller.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 So let's just take this next caller. You're on the airwave, Ron?

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 Dr. Peat?

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 Hey, caller. You're on the air.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 I'm so very grateful. Thank you very much.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 Colorado calling.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 Colorado.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 My name's Jana.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 The question is, I wake up every night with a hypnic headache.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 Is it related to the caller before that?

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 It's a headache that comes on every night at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock or 1 o'clock in the morning.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 And coffee is about the only thing that will relieve it.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 Yeah, I think it is exactly the same thing.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 The parasympathetic system is overactive, pushes the blood sugar down, and then the inflammatory things get loose in the intestine and blood vessels.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 And I've used sugar and milk as a very compact and easy way to interrupt the night.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 If you expect that to happen at 1 or 2, if you wake up at, say, 1230 and have maybe a half a glass of milk with a heaping tablespoon of sugar in it, it will usually help you get through the rest of the night without it.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 How would you see low thyroid as a mechanism by which to help control blood sugar in relation to hypnic issues?

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 Yeah, I think the low thyroid function is the basic thing.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 It develops because of accumulating PUFA, polyunsaturated fats, in the system.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 And then when your thyroid is low, the prostaglandins are let loose and activate the histamine release.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 And so at the base of the problem, if you can't get rid of the polyunsaturated fats, which takes years of being careful with your food, increasing your thyroid can achieve pretty much the same thing,

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 stabilizing your tissues so that they don't release so much unsaturated fat during the night.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 Thank you, Dr. Peat.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 Another question, does the coffee enema, is it the same effect as drinking coffee?

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 I think drinking coffee with cream in it is better because you absorb it slowly and steadily, especially if it's with some food.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 Maybe a raw carrot, for example, will extend the absorption of the caffeine and keep your blood sugar up.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 Thank you so much.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 The coffee enema gives you a very sharp increase that can be stressful.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 That makes sense. Thank you very much. That makes a lot of sense.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 Okay, thank you for your call, caller.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 Okay, well we've just about got about six to eight minutes left, so if anybody else wants to call in, either related or unrelated to this month's subject of allergy, please do so.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 There's a 923 number, which is 3911 for those who are local in the 707 area code, or there's an 800 toll-free number, which is 1-800-568-3723.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 Once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Ray Peat's wisdom shared with us.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 Dr. Peat, talking about some of the herb plants that have been used traditionally to treat allergies,

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 I wonder how many of these might actually have more of a gut-related anti-inflammatory effect, and that is how they become allergy treatable type approaches.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 So, things like turmeric, I was reading, I mean, we know all about turmeric in terms of its anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer type mechanisms,

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 but I wonder whether those tourmarines and those other potent compounds within turmeric could be more gut-related in terms of their anti-inflammatory effect, and that way have an effect on allergies.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 I suspect they are.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 The soothing, the famous soothing teas, such as chamomile, I think are working largely on the intestine, and cooked mushrooms are definitely acting on the intestine primarily.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 Have you heard of a compound called chromolin and sodium chromoglycate?

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 Yeah, but I've never used them, but I've heard about them a lot.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 These actually, I looked this up, and they come from a plant, an Egyptian plant that I've known in herbal medicine, but never used it, called amivisnaga.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:36.000
 Apparently it's been used for a couple of millennia in Egypt, so that's one of those other alternatives.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 And then the methylxanthines, I know I've heard you speak fairly extensively about xanthines and methylxanthines before,

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 so things like theophylline from cocoa beans apparently contain a lot of methylxanthine.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 Caffeine is my favorite of the category, but there is one that's used medically that has, I think it's five carbons added to it to make it a little more stable in the intracellular.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 It's a phyllo, I can't think of the name of it, but it's a medically approved version of caffeine.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 Okay. Alright. How much are you aware of, I know you've mentioned Datura quite a lot too, as being a good anti-cholinergic, and it's a muscarinic antagonist then.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 But, and I know we've talked about the dry mouth syndrome, for me in herbal medicine traditionally,

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 I would always, in England I can't say that I do it here because I'm not allowed, but in England I could prescribe Datura or atropabelidon

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 and give it to the patient with the caveat that when they just began to get a dry mouth, that would be their threshold point at which they could back off their dose slightly,

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 and that would be their maintenance dose for treating them for asthma, for example, with Datura.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 Do you know whether or not the physiological tolerance for something like that class of compound to be used for allergies and asthma could be tolerated over long term?

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 Oh, yeah, I think the dry mouth is really the only serious side effect.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:33.000
 I've known people who loved it so much that they ruined their teeth.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 Wow. Because they used it enough because that was what they were using it for, you're saying, because it was chronic?

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:50.000
 Yeah, they would have night seizures or night asthma or night headaches or whatever, and it's very good for that, but it's very bad to do it chronically.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 You can do the same thing safely with the oily vitamins, vitamin E, vitamin D, vitamin K in particular,

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 and vitamin B6 and thiamine are important for stabilizing the mast cells and blood sugar, and magnesium is essential.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 It works with thyroid, so you can't expect magnesium or thyroid to work perfectly without the cooperation of the two at the same time.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:35.000
 Yeah. Okay, so once again, then we come back to the subject of adequate sugars, adequate thyroid hormone,

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 avoidance of the polyunsaturated set block thyroid hormone, and the necessity of getting a clean diet with bowels moving correctly

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 and not suffering from constipation and reabsorbing endotoxin as a pretty good way forward in terms of just those things

00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:00.000
 which are fairly easy to do for the approach to asthma and/or allergies in general.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 And I think getting back to the gut origin of allergies as you made that link, not just to the kind of inspired respiratory airborne allergens,

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 but actually a lot of it can start in the gut, and I know you've mentioned a lot in the past cascara as a good bowel laxative

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 and a compound which has a fairly similar structure to tetracycline chemically.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 Yeah, and the drug companies are seeming to get interested in it as a cancer treatment, treatment for dementia and heart disease,

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:47.000
 and it has a tremendous range of beneficial protective effects besides protecting the intestine.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 So I'll have to watch out for that one being banned, I presume.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
 Yeah, it's so good.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 In the short term, it'll just get too many good things going for it, and they'll pull it off the market under the guise of some toxicity, I would think.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 Anyway, all right, well, it's 5 to 8, and obviously too late for anybody else to call in,

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 but wanted to just thank you so much for your time and your giving of yourself to come to these radio shows,

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 and I know that you've become pretty much the mainstay of the show here for quite a few years now,

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 so I do appreciate your time and appreciate everything that you do for us, Dr. Peat.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 Okay, so for those people that have listened to the show and want to know more about Dr. Ray Peat and about his work and his life,

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 his website is www.raypeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 He has a lot of articles there which are fully referenced, bibliographic, fully referenced articles, very scientific.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:53.000
 I know some of it's a little heavy going if you are just an average person who doesn't really have a science background,

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 but there's enough in the writing there anyway just to get the gist of what he's saying,

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:03.000
 and some of the stuff also could be looked up, but anyway, it's very well worthwhile reading.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000
 A lot of the material, you won't find it anywhere else.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 A lot of what he advocates, you will not hear the mainstream media advocating.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 So, www.raypeat.com.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 We can be contacted any time Monday through Friday on 1-888-WBM-ERB,

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 or our website address is www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:32.000
 So, we're in the springtime now, and it'll just be getting lighter and warmer and brighter and drier,

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 so there's that to look forward to, but for those people perhaps who are going to get the allergies coming on here,

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 I hope there's been lots of information in this show, not both dietarily,

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 but with those other things that one can do to either avoid the learned helplessness in social environments,

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 and also to enrich their environment with positive things,

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:01.000
 as well as using herbs and other supplements with which to offset that inflammation that is the hallmark of allergies.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000
 So, until the third Friday of next month, thank you so much for joining,

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 and for those questions who called in, thank you for your time.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 I'll talk to you next third Friday of April. Good night.
