00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Welcome and thank you for joining us again this third Friday of the month.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 My name is Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Every third Friday of the month, we produce a program called Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 And we are very pleased again this month to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us on the show

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 to share in his wisdom.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 And this month's subject is going to be the antioxidants,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 some of the myths about antioxidants, what antioxidants really do,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 and how they're helpful, and how some of the history of antioxidants has been skewed

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 and our current understanding of antioxidants has been misled by the manufacturers and other parties.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 So we're going to talk about antioxidants and their role in health.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 I know we're coming into the fall here, and as the decreasing daylight hours, etc., combine,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 most people are under an amount of stress.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 And antioxidants, I think we all know them as anti-stress or at least free radical quenching.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 I think that's most of people's understanding of antioxidants.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 But we're going to explore antioxidants in more depth.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Okay, so people that are living in the area, it's a call-in show from 7.30 until 8 o'clock.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 You're invited and welcome to call in about this subject or any other questions you may have.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 The number, if you live in the area, is 923 3911.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Or if you live outside the area, there's a toll-free number you can call on.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 That's 1-800-568-3723.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 That's 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 So, like I said, once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us to share his wealth of knowledge.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Thank you for joining us, Dr. Peat.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Okay, so as usual, there may be people that haven't heard of you

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 and people that have just tuned in for the first time perhaps.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 So I'd appreciate it if you'd let people know your academic and professional background so people can hear more about you.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 I have taught several universities various courses related to biology and biochemistry, for example, in Mexico.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 I taught immunology and intermediate metabolism.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 But my research was in reproductive aging at the University of Oregon.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 And my dissertation advisor, Arnold Soderwall, happened to be a major figure in vitamin E research.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 He found that hamsters remained fertile much longer if he gave them increasingly large doses of vitamin E.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 And although I didn't work with vitamin E myself,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 that was sort of the background for my research with estrogen, progesterone, and oxidative metabolism.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 Okay, so I guess I think probably what we should do, I think most people, myself included, have a,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 oh, I don't know, I call it a medical understanding of what we commonly know as antioxidants and their function in the body.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 And I know when we get going, you're going to describe some of the ill effects that some antioxidants can have,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 because they can kind of work both ways in how we can best get the best possible antioxidants from our food or other sources

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 that are certainly a lot safer than most of the vitamins that people will buy off the shelf of a health food store, for example,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 or another whole food place.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 So would you outline the effects of antioxidants and the body's system of antioxidants and why they are important to our health?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 People often talk about the body's innate antioxidant system,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 and they usually refer to the glutathione in cells and the enzymes that reduce glutathione when it has been oxidized.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 And superoxide dismutase and catalase are considered to be at the center of our own antioxidant system

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 with uric acid as a circulating major protection against free radicals.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 That's interesting. Can I hold you there for a second there?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Because uric acid is something that I was always led to believe was a cause of gouts.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Is that true enough?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 It's involved in being an antioxidant.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 It's also involved in protecting against inflammation because inflammation involves things that are thought of as oxidative damage.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Molecules get oxidized and changed.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 And so even though uric acid is probably defensive against inflammation, it tends to eventually get crystallized in the process of defending against the inflammation.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 And so you often find crystals of uric acid in an inflamed joint.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 But people can have crystals of uric acid in the tissue with no symptoms at all.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 And symptoms like gout can occur without the crystals.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 And crystals of phosphate are probably more common in gout than uric acid crystals, but without analyzing them, people consider them to be uric acid.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 So it's more the inflammation that someone would have anyway, whether it was in soft tissue or joint,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 that uric acid would come onto the scene to be an antioxidant that then typically associates uric acid with gout.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Yeah, apparently, because it is considered our main, quantitatively, our main antioxidant defense.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Inside cells, glutathione is considered because it's the reductant that can block a lot of oxidative molecules.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 And you mentioned superoxide dismutase.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Yeah, and recently, some studies of roundworms and aging have found that superoxide double dose actually might shorten their longevity.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 A lot of things are being reconsidered in recent years regarding superoxide, for example, in the ionized air effect, in which negative air ions have anti-inflammatory effects.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 It turns out that superoxide, which many people think of as one of the worst oxidants, it happens to be produced when we breathe negatively ionized air.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 And it's produced in the lung, and the lung is the main place where serotonin is detoxified and destroyed.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 And serotonin is destroyed in the lungs under the influence of superoxide.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 So is this why they say if you walk along a seashore and there's breaking waves, there's a release of negative ions and it's supposed to help your lungs?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Yeah.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Especially for asthmatics, it's supposed to help. Is that because it's lowering the serotonin in their lungs?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 Yeah, there's a series of papers done in Poland that call it the serotonin irritation syndrome.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 And there are the ones that concluded about a 20-year series of studies showing that the ions are helping to destroy serotonin in the lungs.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 The superoxide dismutase that destroys superoxide, that has been thought of as a defense against this free radical.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 But we don't necessarily just want to increase that antioxidant because sometimes it's involved with making inflammation worse if we get rid of too much superoxide.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 When you hear this research coming out with, "Oh, this new antioxidant has been discovered," we have to look into it a little bit more because it could be counterproductive to have too much of some of these wonderful antioxidants.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Yeah, the advertisements often say this chemical is 100 times better antioxidant than vitamin E and so on.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 That doesn't mean that it's going to be safe in the body because vitamin E fits into this system of superoxide and glutathione and vitamin C, uric acid and so on in a very tightly organized system.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 And if you put in something that's 100 times more active against oxidants or free radicals in vitro, you really don't have any idea of what it's going to do in the body.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 The main plant substances that are now being called antioxidants, most of them are polyphenolic compounds.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 There's almost 100% overlap between the polyphenolics as antioxidants and the polyphenolics as estrogens.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 I was just thinking about that overlap and how 30 or 40 years ago, these same chemicals were classed together as tannins.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 And 50 or 60 years ago, someone had discovered that the tannins helped to seal the skin of a burned person.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 That's right. I remember that being called an eschar.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 To sort of prevent the seepage.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 After doing that for maybe 20 or 30 years, they started seeing that it was a carcinogen.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 So in the 70s, tannins were identified as very effective carcinogens.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Some of them injected into animals produced.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Okay. Well, I wonder if the same... I'm sorry. I don't mean to hold you up because the trainer thought where you're going.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 I don't want to lose it.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 The tannins, when they're used intravenously, I can understand.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 But what do you think about topical use of tannins?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 Because that was pretty big in herbal medicine school when we were studying.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Well, yeah. That's what turned up in the 70s.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 These people who had been treated topically for burns were getting skin cancer.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 Wow.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Cancers in the area treated.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 Can you list some examples of these polyphenols or these tannins that are associated with increasing estrogen and carcinogens?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 It's almost an endless series.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 But the famous ones are elagic acid and gallic acid.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Those are the old...

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 From tan...

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 From like oak bark.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 Yeah.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Because I always thought of the phenolics as very, in a classical sense, very heating and drying.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 They were very hot kind of substances.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Yeah. They have many, many variations on their effects.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 But it was just interesting that the very same substances that are now called antioxidants and estrogens used to be thought of as tannins.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 Wow.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Okay. So the background from which they've come has changed considerably.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 And now it seems that the industry is calling them yet another compound that can be marketed to people to help them in their quest for the antioxidant effect that they've been warned they need so much.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 Yeah. Vitamin D is the famous oldest sold antioxidant supplement.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 But it was, when it was first discovered, it was called the fertility vitamin.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 And it was sold to increase virility and fertility and so on.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 But the Schutt family in the 1930s found that it not only made infertile women more fertile by analogy with what my professor did 20 years after that, but he was doing it clinically.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 And he knew that these women with excess estrogen who were infertile often suffered from blood clot diseases, venous clots, and sometimes embolisms in the lung and strokes and so on.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 And he found that vitamin E not only made them fertile by antagonizing the estrogen, but it prevented the clotting problems.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 And he showed very clearly its anti-clotting effect was part of its anti-estrogen effect.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 And since the estrogen had also, during that same period of about 15 years up to 1940, it was known to intensify the effects of unsaturated fats in oxidizing.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 It catalyzed their conversion into age pigment, interacting with iron and unsaturated fats.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 So it was an oxidant, a clot former, an anti-fertility substance, and pro-inflammatory.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 And as the oil industry began promoting their seed oils, first for animal, fattening animals, they were adding it to lab chow and such for research animals.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 It turned out that the animals were suffering from degenerative brain diseases and testicular degeneration.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 And someone found that vitamin E connected, apparently they were thinking of it as the pro-fertility vitamin to protect against the testicular destruction.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 And they found that it did in fact protect against the toxic effects of the unsaturated fats.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 And this was a very sudden shift away from vitamin E as the anti-estrogen, and it started being called the antioxidant protective against the breakdown of the unsaturated fats.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 And you were saying they added iron to the animals' feed and then they stopped seeing the beneficial effects of the vitamin E, correct?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Yes, for several years they found that the apparently supplemented feed no longer cured the brain degeneration.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 And they found that the vitamin E was being destroyed right in the product by the presence of iron.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 But the same thing happens in the organism.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 Vitamin E and polyunsaturated fats are very interactive and pro-oxidative.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 But the industries, both the estrogen industry and the seed oil industry, found that this was a way to distract the public from thinking of estrogen and the unsaturated fats as being dangerous.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Because if vitamin E was just protecting against oxidation, then all you needed was fresh oil and vitamin E to prevent the breakdown of the oil.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 And they suppressed the idea that vitamin E was an anti-estrogen, anti-clot, hard protective drug for about 40 years.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 And this made me think about prenatal vitamins when a woman is exposed to much higher estrogen levels.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 I know eventually it's also much higher progesterone levels.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 But prenatal vitamins have a large dose of iron and a large dose of vitamin C.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 Like we were also talking about, that gets destroyed with iron as well.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Yeah, and that's analogous to something that happens inside the cell during stress if you're overloaded with iron.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 When your cell can't use oxygen properly, any reductant, including vitamin C, will react to turn the highly oxidized iron into the partly reduced form, ferrous iron.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 In which case, that iron then becomes a major oxidant transferring its electron to fats, proteins, DNA and so on.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 About 10 years ago, a free radical researcher put some vitamin C.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 First he started with a 500 milligram commercial tablet dissolved in a liter of distilled water and found it produced a terrible intensity of free radicals.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 So then he got the purest reagent grade available.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 And the same thing happened.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 And he analyzed it and found that there were several heavy metals in it.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 But since he knew about iron's effect, he used just a very small trace of iron.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 Not adding any of the other oxidants, but found that that amount of iron was in fact enough to just turn the commercial ascorbic acid into a powerful oxidant.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 Now this obviously happens in people's bodies.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 And when they take ascorbic acid, which is a form of vitamin C, we see most often available in pills of vitamin C.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 And obviously iron is prevalent in everybody's body.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 And in a lot of foods.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 And in foods, of course.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 So this kind of thing...

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Or in a multivitamin when it's combined together.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Yeah. So this is the same thing that's happening essentially.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Go ahead.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 Yeah. This chemist said, "Isn't it amazing that this amount of free radicals you would think would kill anything?"

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 But he said, "It shows what amazing defenses our stomachs and intestines must have to survive taking ascorbic acid."

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 Wow. And I know in this country too, I'm not putting any blame down.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 I'm just saying that there seems to be a kind of cultural trend towards mega dosing.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 That was not something I was... I wasn't familiar with it when I first came here.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 So, you know, doses of five or more grams of vitamin C a day was not uncommon.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Yeah. Linus Pauling pointed out that a goat that weighs as much as a person would be producing about 4,000 milligrams of vitamin C a day.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 Okay.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 And I had been taking large amounts of vitamin C and was reacting badly to it, having a cough and very chronic serious symptoms.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 So I stopped taking it.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 And after I hadn't taken it for a while, I wondered how much vitamin C I must be putting out in my urine every day.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 And just on an ordinary diet at that time, including bread and potatoes and things that you don't think of as having any vitamin C,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 I was still putting out 3,000 milligrams a day consistently.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 Wow.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 And that got me interested in where the vitamin C was coming from.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 It turns out that meat, for example, is extremely rich in dehydroascorbic acid, dehydroascorbate.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 And that is not measured.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 They measure the reduced form, ordinary ascorbic acid, when they analyze foods.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 And so they're simply not looking at the major form in food.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 Most of the foods have more ascorbic acid than the analysts show.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 And it's functioning in the cell as an oxidant, and that's how it's having a major part of its protective effect.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Because when something goes wrong with the oxidative system, if you just turn off the blood supply, for example,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 the outcome of a temporary heart arrest, for example, if you get the blood restored,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 you have great oxidative damage done from the lack of oxygen.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 And if you have it temporarily shut off of the blood supply so that the oxygen isn't processing the fuels in the cell,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 the electrons that are coming from fat and sugar and protein being metabolized,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 these electrons will essentially escape and do random damage.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 But the presence of the oxidative dehydroascorbate in the cell functions as a substitute for oxygen for a short time.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 And it soaks up these random damaging electrons being turned back into ordinary ascorbic acid,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 which then becomes water-soluble, leaves the cell.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 Wow, so there's a huge amount of this form of vitamin C that plays an extremely important role in our physiology.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 And when the food analysts have looked at levels in food, they're just not even looking at this level.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 So they say all these foods that contain a form of vitamin C do not contain any vitamin C.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 So it's another like black is white kind of story.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 People who don't eat a significant amount of bread, pasta and beans will typically consume in their other foods,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 3,000 to 4,000 milligrams of vitamin C a day, equivalent.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 And this is in the form of fruits or?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 Fruits, meat, milk, fish.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 OK, Dr. Peter, I'd like to hold it there for a moment because we have a caller on the line so we can run this caller through

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 and then we can carry on unless there's any other callers.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 And we want to come back and talk about the food sources of vitamin C in the supplements when they say they're food-based.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 Yeah, we want to mention lots of different things.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 So let's just take this next caller.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 Hello.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 Yeah, you're on the air.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Oh, hi. I thank you all so very much for doing this.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 I have a question a little bit off topic, very off topic.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 It's about milk.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Dr. Peat, I know how much of a proponent you are of milk drinking even as a primary protein source.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 And I was increasing my milk drinking sort of after your example.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 And then I came across a paper titled "How Milk Causes Osteoporosis."

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 Are you aware of that paper?

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 Yeah, there's almost an organization of anti-milk people.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 And that's one of their worst publications.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 It just doesn't -- everything about it is --

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 Unscientific probably.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 Mistaken, yes.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Well, I know it does -- the prefacing remarks or sort of their foundational statements talk about the protective effects of estrogen.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 Now, I understand that you don't agree with that.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 There's so much evidence.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 I'm tending toward your reasoning.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 But the thing that kind of gave me pause was when they paralleled the high bone density of the people in, you know,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 countries where they drink a lot of milk and the correlated high rates of osteoporosis.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 And that -- I mean, can you say anything -- address that at all?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 Yeah, much of it is the lack of vitamin D in those countries.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 If you compare someone in Vietnam who eats maybe 600 milligrams of calcium from vegetables

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 and someone in Sweden who might get 2,000 milligrams from milk and cheese,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 the people in Vietnam are outside a lot getting sunlight and vitamin D.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 And their diet is rich in magnesium and other nutrients.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 But a lot of the -- since milk production is high in the high latitude countries,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 part of that effect that some people talk about is the lack of vitamin D.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 So it's a lack of vitamin D in the northern hemisphere that's causing the osteoporosis,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 even amongst milk drinkers.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 But having said that, 2,000 milligrams of calcium a day,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 you have to drink almost a half a gallon of milk a day to get that.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 And, I mean, I don't know if you know any Swedish people that drink half a gallon of milk a day,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 but I certainly don't know any myself.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 That's the amount that I consider to be protective against high blood pressure

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 and heart disease and such.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 But for the bones, 1,000 to 1,200 is probably an acceptable amount.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 Doctor, do you -- so there's no truth -- there's no accuracy to their claim that,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 essentially, we have a finite number of osteoblasts and we use them up?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 No.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 Did I state that clearly enough for the audience?

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 What was that?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 Yes, you did.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 Did I state that clearly enough for the audience?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 I couldn't understand that.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 For the sake of the people listening that didn't read this paper, did I state that clearly enough?

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 Oh, yeah, I think so.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 The osteoblasts are regenerating, being renewed, so there's no finite population.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 I mean, that's not even normal medical science to say that there's a finite population of osteoblasts

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 and osteoclasts.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 They're constantly breaking down bone and constantly building bone.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 And another point about the osteoporosis is that when they do these bone mineral density scans,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 it's not actually looking at the health of the bone and the protein structure.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 It's just looking at the minerals through an X-ray,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 and it's not looking at the overall picture of the health of the bone.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 So it's not an accurate way to determine someone's health of the bone.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 It shows a part of the picture.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 But when you look at a population that's similar in other ways,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 the difference between milk drinking and not milk drinking corresponds to strong bones and weak bones

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 or smaller bones, and animal experiments really are the clearest way to understand medical issues.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 But whenever a medical doctrine chooses to sell a product that conflicts with the animal studies,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 they say we can't go by anything except double-blind human clinical studies.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 Much of medicine is based on animal studies, and they're a perfectly valid way for most issues.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 I won't monopolize the conversation, but I thank you so much.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 Bye-bye now.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 Thank you very much for your call.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 Okay, just want to remind people again,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Galbraithville 91.1 FM.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 And from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's topic of antioxidants.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 The number is 923-3911, or if you live outside the area, 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, going back to vitamin C,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 I think it's probably the vitamin that most people recognize as antioxidant and health-promoting,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 especially for colds and coughs.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 They market it for flu and that kind of thing, and it's kind of very much promoted in the wintertime.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 Can I just ask you about experiments that were done with ascorbic acid that were kind of --

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 would make you shy away from it?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 I know you mentioned the ascorbic acid itself is pretty damaging

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 and is not the kind of form that you would find in foods,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 and the form that you would find in foods from meat and fruits, et cetera, is certainly more suitable.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 And the iron that most bodies contain and/or foods contain is very harmful in its own right as a free radical.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 The damage that's caused by it is a lot more than is to be avoided by taking a vitamin for it.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 You know what?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 There's actually a caller on the air.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 So let's take this caller before we go too much further with that.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 I'll try and hold that thought.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Sorry.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 Caller, you're on the air.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 Hi.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 I'm calling with a question about diabetes.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 I am newly diagnosed with diabetes.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 I'm 68 -- I mean 67.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 I guess I feel older already.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 My question is, is a restricted calorie diet helpful?

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 And another question -- another issue I wanted to bring up was an article I read in the science section of the New York Times a couple weeks ago.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 It titled "High stress can make insulin cells regress."

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 It said in mice with type 2 diabetes,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 the researchers showed that beta cells that had lost function were not dead at all, most remained alive but in a changed form.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 They reverted to an earlier developmental progenitor state.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 So I'm thinking maybe that would lead to some kind of treatment.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 But anyway, I'm trying to get on top of it and trying to control it with diet if I can and not being very successful.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 So I wondered if -- Dr. Peat, if you had any suggestions?

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 Well, the cells can replace themselves in several different ways, and that thing of regressing and re-differentiating is one way.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 But a well-established way is that the alpha cells in the pancreas are converted steadily into beta cells.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 And so you can completely kill off all of the beta cells by eating too much unsaturated fat, for example,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 and have supposedly the type 1 diabetes in which you're not making any insulin.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 But if you stop killing the beta cells, the alpha cells are known to be able to replenish them.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 But the stimulus and the defense to keep the replacement going from the alpha cells is sugar.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 That's just what diabetics avoid.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 Yeah.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 So for our listeners, unsaturated fats include all of those vegetable oils that are liquid.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 Yes, I have read some of your articles, Dr. Peat, and I've been omitting that from my diet and using coconut oil.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 And it can take up to four years for you to replace all of your polyunsaturated fat cells with a saturated fat cell.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 You've probably seen some of the news about a hundred-year-old study.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 They used to use aspirin to cure diabetes, and in the last year there have been some articles commenting on that

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 and confirming that it in fact helps you handle glucose fairly quickly to lower your blood glucose.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 And aspirin happens to be a very powerful antioxidant of a safe kind that prevents the excess electrons from things such as polyunsaturated fats,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 destroying cells such as the beta cells.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 So the aspirin is not only intensifying your ability to immediately use glucose,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 but it's also protecting against any of the residual polyunsaturated fats that are still stored in your body.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 And if you eat like 325 milligrams a day or --

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 Some people take that much with each meal to get their blood sugar down,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 but if you're taking that much, it's important to take vitamin K,

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 since that's the only serious side effect of too much aspirin is that it can make you have a bleeding predisposition.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 So if you take more than one baby aspirin a day, you need to take one milligram of vitamin K with each standard aspirin tablet of 325 milligrams,

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 and that is equivalent -- and if you see in the health food stores, you'll see that they can come in micrograms.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 So that would be 1,000 micrograms of vitamin K with each aspirin tablet.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 With each 81 milligram or with each 325?

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 With each 325.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 If you take more than 80 milligrams, then you need to supplement -- I mean 90 milligrams of baby aspirin -- you need to supplement with vitamin K.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 Oh, okay.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 Well, I appreciate that information.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 But what about -- I've heard that sometimes people go on a very restricted calorie diet.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 I heard about like 600 calories a day with some liquid stuff and starchy vegetables

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 that cause some people who had diabetes less than four years to have the condition.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 This was a Dr. Oz report, and I've heard just other stories of people -- is that like give your pancreas a big rest?

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 If you're not eating a lot or is eating small meals good?

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 I mean how do you pamper your pancreas?

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 Some of the low-calorie diets were analyzed, and I think the person doing some of these studies was named BPUYU.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 He found that if you simply reduce the polyunsaturated fats but kept the calories the same,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 you got the same protective effect as a very low-calorie intake.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 When you're reducing your calories to the bare minimum,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 you burn the polyunsaturated fats for energy and they don't get loose to do the damage.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 Oh, really?

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 So if you didn't have a lot of polyunsaturated fats in the first place,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 it wouldn't matter if you ate normal-sized meals.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 But if you are eating polyunsaturated fats, small meals, somehow --

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 It could be dangerous.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 Burn it up?

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 Yeah.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 The polyunsaturated fats?

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 Yeah.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 People who have a high metabolic rate aren't hurt so much by the polyunsaturated fats

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 because they burn them for energy.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 Oh, so aging might be -- maybe your metabolic rate kicks down

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 and you're not taking care of them so well and that could be a factor?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 The PUFA inhibits your thyroid function and blocks your oxidative metabolism,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 allowing the free radicals to get loose and damage things,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 so you get a progressive destruction of your ability to oxidize food.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 And so you become more and more susceptible to those things as you get older.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 Yeah.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 Well, thank you so much.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 I appreciate being able to talk to you, and you're being generous with this information.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 So thanks a lot.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 I'm on a learning -- steep learning curve.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 So thank you very much.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 Thank you very much for your call.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 Thank you.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 In one of my articles about a year ago,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 I mentioned some studies that were done in Paris about 1860 and then in England

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 in which some very serious diabetes cases,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 these people who were basically had only two or three months to live,

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 they were wasting away so fast,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 putting out almost a pound of sugar in their urine every day at the expense of their body tissues.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 And these two doctors cured their patients by giving them as much sugar in their diet

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 as they were losing in their urine.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 And that they simply didn't know how to explain the cures,

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 but they described the recovery of patients on about 10 to 12 ounces of sugar added to their diet every day.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 And more recently, people have seen that fructose in particular maintains the cell in a state of low phosphate

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 and intense oxidative energy and chelates iron.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 Iron is one of the major things that interacts with the unsaturated fats produced for radicals,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 but fructose keeps the cell oxidized,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 including keeping the iron from catching the electrons that make it toxic

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 and lower the phosphate which produces inflammation.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 And fructose is found in sugar.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 Well, white sugar is half fructose, half glucose,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 and also all fruits have a certain percentage of fructose in them as well as glucose.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 So the old-fashioned sugar diet was not only preventing tissue wasting,

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 but it was having an antioxidant effect in the pancreas,

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 and the sugar was an essential factor for supporting the regeneration of the beta cells.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 To produce insulin.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 Yeah.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 Cool.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 Okay, our engineer has a question.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 So I have a 13-year-old dog who has a wasting syndrome right now.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 He's been just losing weight, and he eats not as much as he used to, but he eats a fair amount.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 But literally, he's close to death because he's losing so much weight.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 Should I try adding sugar to his dog food?

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 Yeah.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 I have a friend who has been feeding his dogs mostly meat.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 One of the dogs he put on a mostly milk diet, and it recovered from his cataracts on the milk diet.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 But this other dog, he thought it was about to die,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 so he put a tablespoon of sugar on each of its servings of meat, and it's recovering.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 And I've seen great results with recovering an injured fowl, ducks and geese, with egg, milk, and sugar.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 As a convalescent food.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 As a convalescent food.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 Dr. Peat gave me that recipe.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 And then also with a goat, too.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 I did the same thing with a goat, and it's amazing how you can turn a blind goat into a seeing goat,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 and a duck that's nearly bled to death into a laying hen again.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 And so you should have custard if you're sick, I guess.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 Exactly.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 One of the very, very foods that Dr. Peat maintains is--

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 Does vanilla have a medicinal effect?

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 It's quite--

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 Vanilla does happen to be anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 There you go.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 I have a great recipe, Michael.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 I'll give it to you.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 Great.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 Well, listen, I'll tell you what.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 I'll pull back my question earlier on about vitamin C.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 Let's move on to something different.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 Well, I do have one more thing to say about vitamin C.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 Okay.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 And that is when you--for those listeners who might be wanting to get a supplement,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 and they think, "Okay, well, I'm going to get a food-based vitamin,"

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 because there's lots of vitamin companies that advertise that theirs is solely food-based.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 It's like you're just--it's concentrated food you're getting your vitamin C from.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 But Dr. Peat pointed out that they can call a food-based vitamin when they take cornstarch

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 and oxidize it with lead to produce the vitamin C.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 So if you're having allergic reactions, check your vitamins.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 Stop them.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 Okay.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 So, Dr. Peat, how about the other antioxidants that are beneficial?

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 I know you mentioned selenium.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 I think selenium is a very important antioxidant, especially with vitamin E.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 Yeah, and the selenium activates thyroid,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 and thyroid by making the cell use oxygen and consuming all of the potentially harmful electrons.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 Thyroid functions as an antioxidant, even though its function is to increase oxidation.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 It prevents the random harmful type of oxidative damage.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 And estrogen, by interfering with the thyroid-activated functions,

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 estrogen produces a lot of reductive stresses to the cell,

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 causes water uptake, shifts the balance towards the reductants away from the oxidants.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 So it's like anti-vitamin E in its effect on the cells.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 Well, it's very aging.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 And progesterone opposes those effects,

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 working with thyroid to keep the cell in its resting oxidized state.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 Okay, very good.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 We do have another caller on the line, so let's take this next caller.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 You're on the air?

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 Hello?

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 Hey, good.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 I love this show.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 Let's get back to sugar for a minute.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 I've got a brother who's been 10 years sober,

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 but he is like a dry drunk in a sense,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 and he consumes gory quantities of Mountain Dew and ginger ale

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 within the second ingredient besides water is hydroxychloroquine.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 And he works outside in the sun and sweats it out, his basic foodstuffs.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 Then he starts drinking it up in the afternoon,

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 and by the evening he's like Dr. Drickle and Mr. Hyde,

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 like he used to be when he was drinking booze, you know?

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:27.000
 So he's getting to a point where he's getting -- they have another syndrome.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 They've identified on the air about people like him who have the warrior gene,

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 the intermittent outbursts, like an eruption over nothing,

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 make things into things and then react to them.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 Do you know what I'm talking about?

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 Yeah, go ahead.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 And the sugar seems to me to be feeding it because it --

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 he gets wired the same way he used to do when he drank.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 And he's one step away from picking up a lamp and hitting you.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 In fact, he's a couple of times on me done this,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 and it doesn't seem to me too funny when it happens,

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 but just talking about it seems weird.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 But he's doing it, and he's acting out.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 I wonder if it's -- it's probably not so much even the high fructose corn syrup,

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 but probably the other products within those kind of drinks.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 The deficiency of other nutrients.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 Yeah, I was going to ask you,

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 does he just drink these sugary drinks and not eat any protein or --

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 Oh, no, he'll do that, but then he'll have three candy bars

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 and pour a bunch of ice in a big 16-ounce thing, drinking the ginger ale and stuff,

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 and then he just keeps doing that until he's saturated with his stuff.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 Well, he could be just very deficient in protein and other B vitamins.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 I don't know.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 Intermittent explosive disorder is what they've got.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 There's a terrific NOVA on this,

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 but I think the sugar and the alcohol, because the molecule is similar, you know what I mean,

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 is doing something there.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 Have you ever been to an AA meeting where people just drink lots of coffee with a lot of sugar in it?

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 Actually, the sugar and the alcohol have almost exactly opposite effects on the cell,

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 contrary to a famous video.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 The alcohol itself versus the sugar itself?

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 Well, fructose in particular is almost an absolute defense against the cellular damage done by ethyl alcohol.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:37.000
 So if a person is being poisoned by ethanol, you can pretty well counteract the damage with fructose.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 But fructose--

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 Well, he's pre-diabetic.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 He wrote me a couple of years ago saying he was pre-diabetic,

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 but he's acting like he's got the--I don't know if you saw this or not, but you should if you haven't.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:53.000
 NOVA this week has a terrific thing on can science stop crime.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 It's about a half hour long, and they talk about all this stuff.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 MAOA, a gene works in the brain cells to regulate levels of neural activity,

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 and a third of the population has--the men have this warrior gene, you know,

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 but it doesn't always come out.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 In fact, the researcher had it, the gene, and the scan, they did brain scans on these people,

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 and the researcher himself did, and he had it too.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
 So there's environmental factors.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 If you were abused as a child, didn't have a lot of friends or whatever,

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
 it can bring it out, the loner type of thing, you know what I mean?

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 But, yeah, I think the sugar is driving a lot of it in the evening especially.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 So you got no comment about that, no idea?

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 That idea has been around as long as I have.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 It got a big boost in the '50s with the publicity for the fat-based damage to the circulatory system

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 and the reaction that, no, it was the fructose, not the fat, which is poisonous.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 And one of the subdivisions of that school of thought is that the sugar is addictive,

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 and if you stop eating it, you have withdrawal symptoms.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:29.000
 Another aspect is that it shifts the balance of the brain transmitters as part of the addiction process.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 I think that's about it.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 But a lot of those things, those theories are done by very limited laboratory groups pushing an ideology.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 For example, they have a particular doctrine about what serotonin does to behavior.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 And contrary to what you can see in dogs and other animals in which aggressive dogs have high serotonin,

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 and if you lower their serotonin, they become peaceful, contrary to studies like that,

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 the publicity is saying that serotonin is the drug of peace and tranquility

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 and that you need to raise the serotonin and that sugar spoils that effect and so on.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 So I don't think those judgments about sugar causing an alcohol-like syndrome are very accurate

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000
 or very scientifically based, I think is what Dr. Peat is trying to say.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000
 Oh, I agree with you there.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 I'm just saying that the sugar that he used to eat before and then now as well,

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 and it's just feeding something inside of him because he gets reactive.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 It's almost like he's high.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 Well, it sounds like he might have some other nutritional deficiencies.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000
 Okay.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000
 Well, put it on the air if you've got any news about it.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 I'd like to know because I'm about ready to kick his ass.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000
 I don't want to do that.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:09.000
 A nutritional deficiency often goes with having a reaction to a certain food

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 simply because those drinks don't have any magnesium to speak of.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000
 Right.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 Without magnesium, then your brain transmitters leak out and get out of balance.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 So a magnesium supplement would be something for him to try.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 Yeah, I'll stop doing the other stuff.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000
 Anyway, thanks a lot.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
 I appreciate you talking to me about it.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 It's good to be a violent thing in the family, and I'm his older brother,

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 and it's on me.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 Thank you very much for your call.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000
 Thank you.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 Bye.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 Okay, thanks for listening.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 Okay, well, it is 5 to 8 now, so I'm not too sure we're going to have any more callers for sure.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 So, Dr. Peat, I just want to say--go ahead.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 Okay, before we wrap this up,

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 I just want to mention something about vitamin E, Dr. Peat, that you had mentioned.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 It's important if people are going to be supplementing with vitamin E,

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 and it's especially important if people are eating PUFA fats,

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 polyunsaturated fatty acids that are found in pork and chicken and fish,

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 and/or eating vegetable oils or fried food,

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 a vitamin E supplement is much more needed by the body,

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 and it's important to get a mixed tocopherol, not just the D-alpha tocopherol.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000
 Yeah, the D-alpha was the antioxidant,

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 but they suppressed the information about the complete vitamin E,

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 which related to preventing clots and tumors and estrogen symptoms and so on.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:51.000
 So a vitamin E supplement might be safe, but a vitamin C supplement definitely isn't.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:56:00.000
 No, you can get as much vitamin C as your body can use just from foods.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 Okay, so to sum up again, and for those people that are listening,

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000
 I know Dr. Peat is a very strong proponent, and rightly so,

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 of saturated fats rather than the polyunsaturated fats,

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 and that yet again there's another way of supporting your health with foods principally

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 and avoiding the polyunsaturated that are so linked to thyroid suppression

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
 and all the negative effects of that.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000
 And aging.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 And aging.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 I know you mentioned very quickly, you mentioned that lipofushkin,

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 that's age pigment, being a productive effect of free radical damage and low thyroid.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 Do you think that's a very quick question,

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:47.000
 but do you think that's a good gauge of how much stress someone is under cellularly,

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 if they have a lot of age spots?

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
 Oh, yeah, definitely.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 If you can see them on the skin, you're getting them in your brain and other organs.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
 And it's dietary.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:11.000
 Yeah, and if they're fairly new, vitamin E and even other things can reverse it fairly quickly.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 I've seen progesterone and vitamin E and even a tiny bit of vodka can help to remove them.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 Okay.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.000
 Thanks so much for your time.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000
 I know we've only got two minutes left,

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 so I wanted to make sure that people can access your website and find out more about you.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
 So thanks so much for joining us, Dr. Peat.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 Okay, so Dr. Raymond Peat's website is www.raypeat.com,

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:48.000
 and on his home page there are probably something in excess of 50 fully referenced scientific articles on many subjects,

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 and well worth a read because you'll find a very different opinion about things that you perhaps have believed from the media.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 So I very much encourage you to go and check his website out.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:04.000
 Also, he has approached -- people have approached him through his website as well for his time

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 and his opinion on various medical matters.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.000
 So a great resource, and I'm always very pleased to have Dr. Peat sharing his wisdom with us.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:19.000
 So until next month when the clocks will go back and it'll be dark and winter's going to be coming,

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 thanks so much for tuning in and listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor.
