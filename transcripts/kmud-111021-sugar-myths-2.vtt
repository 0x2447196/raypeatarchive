00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Hi, and welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 And my name's Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8pm,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 and we recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Well, again, I just want to reiterate that it's become increasingly obvious over the last few years

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 that if you really want to get the point across, you cannot just mention it once or twice.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 But that reminds people of the same subject and brings out the science and the proof, if you like,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 of what it is that is counter-culture. It is a good way to refresh people's memories that often what they hear

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 and what they see is not always the way it is. And actually, there's more to it than meets the eye.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 And that it's up to us individually to take responsibility for our own actions and our own decisions

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 by seeing the broader picture and finding the information that is out there freely available.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 If only we would look. I often end the end of the show with the phrase, "To those who have ears, let them hear."

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Well, for those of us who have eyes and ears, let us see and hear what there is out there.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Again, the program will be, yeah, what's the word, spiced up. And I can't say that in any other ways

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 than we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us here again for this month's show

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 and to bring his wisdom and his research to bear upon the subjects that which don't always seem to be

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 the way that we would have been told the way they are. But like I said, you repeat the question or repeat the solution

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 more than once and time and time again, it suddenly begins to become more of a reality

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 and especially when it's backed up with science to counter the supposed science that wants to tell us

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 the other way is the way it is. So, Dr. Peat, thank you so much for joining us again.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 First of all, I think as always, there are people here who just have never heard us before.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Maybe they haven't heard of you either, but I'm not so sure about that.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Would you like to just describe your academic and research background for the benefit of any new listeners?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Okay. Following on what you were just talking about, my academic career went from linguistics to biology

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 and there was a continuity of a sort from studying grammar and the structure of language

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 to thinking about strictly biological questions. In linguistics, I was concentrating on how culture interacts

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 with the structure of language. I was seeing the evolution over hundreds and hundreds of years

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 of understanding in the culture as being what shapes the way the grammar itself of language works.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 For various reasons, I switched over to biology thinking to understand the brain better.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 The brain is the organ that carries culture and language. So, when I got into biology

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 and went from brain work to reproductive physiology, I was still interested in those questions

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 of how the context interacts with the structure. The focus on language made me see that there was an identity

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 between the surrounding culture and the physical structure of the language.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 Then going from the brain to other aspects of physiology, I saw that the environment is a part of the organism.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 So, that accounts for my orientation in biology that it's really concentrating on the interaction

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 moment by moment between the animal and the environment.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 I think before we get started on to a continuation of last month's subject, which were surrounding sugars

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 and the debunking of the cholesterol heart disease myth, this month's show is going to be a continuation

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 of last month's show, Dr. Peat, on the sugars and how beneficial they are, just to highlight the particular sugars

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 that we're going to be looking at that are beneficial without doubt and there's plenty of research to back it up

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 as fructose, as a fruit sugar. But before we get into that, I think it would be useful, if for no other reason

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 than for me to understand that you've spent 20 to 25 years or 30 years researching the areas of academic science

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 that you were involved in doing your PhD, which was around hormones and their interactions.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 How often do you find... I think it's more like 40 years. I'm sorry.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Okay, well 40 years. That's a compliment, Dr. Peat. He thinks you're younger than you are.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 Okay, how often do you find that the mainstream science conflicts with the evidence that you find?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Oh, well, that was a constant, almost daily experience in my attending lectures.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 I was really surprised any time a professor said anything that I thought really related meaningfully

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 to the biological facts. There was a book that was used as a text in genetics. It was called Classical Papers in Genetics.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 And reading through that, I couldn't find any case in which the facts were honestly presented.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 It was really a little handbook of ideology. My experience with the academic science people was that

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 they are very heavy on ideology, very light on facts. I almost never saw a science professor in the science library.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 I spent many years every day reading in the library. I think I saw maybe four professors.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Two of them I saw more than once.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 Okay, well let's get into the meat of this month's continuing program on sugars.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 Again, just to reiterate the fact that the lies, I think it was Adolf Hitler who said that

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 you have to make a lie colossal enough and repeat it often enough for people to really believe it as truth.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 So it's not just small lies, but sometimes colossal lies that are put out there that are certainly things we have to watch out for

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 when we hear whatever we hear. So let's go on to the sugars.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 For the benefit of our listeners, you have a bi-monthly newsletter that you produce.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 The last newsletter actually, we just received it, it was on sugars.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 I know that you've always, your father had diabetes and that was a personal experience upon which you were interacting.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 There was a statement in your newsletter towards the last part of it that the addition of fructose to glucose during infusion,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 intra-portal infusion, increased the net glucose uptake even when the insulin secretion was compromised as in the diabetics.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 Yeah, they refer to that as a catalytic property of fructose.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 It doesn't just increase the metabolism and uptake of glucose, but it increases the whole metabolism of the animal.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 In several types of experiments, they've seen a 50% increase in the whole metabolic rate.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 That's basically why I'm so interested in the effects of fructose because the research I did at the university had to do with aging

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 and oxidative metabolism and the perversion of oxidative energy production with aging and with various toxins,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 hormones and unsaturated fats and so on.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 The thyroid hormone is what basically distinguishes humans from fungus and bacteria and such.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 The higher development of the brain goes, the more oxidative energy production is needed.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 The development of a baby's brain prenatally is very closely tied to the amount of glucose it metabolizes.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 You restrict the glucose to the baby and the brain is smaller.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 You feed it extra glucose and the brain is bigger.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 Okay, so can I just interrupt you there, Dr. Peate, but for our listeners, just go over a little bit of sugar science here.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Everybody's familiar with the white sugar and that's sucrose, which is half fructose, because you've mentioned fructose now,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 and also half glucose.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Then all fruits contain approximately the same ratio of fructose and glucose as white sugar.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 It's half fructose, half glucose.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Then other sources of carbohydrates like grains, beans, starches, any other carbohydrate-like food, bread, pasta, potatoes,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 fruit, vegetables, they are almost all glucose, so they're devoid of the fructose.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 It's easy to remember fructose because it sounds kind of like fruit.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 The only place fructose slows down glucose is in the absorption from the intestine.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 The fructose itself is slow to be absorbed compared to glucose.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 So if you eat starch like white rice or white bread, you'll get a very sharp increase in the amount of glucose in the blood.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 That will stimulate insulin to handle that rising glucose, and that stimulates cortisol to prevent the reverse reaction from too much insulin

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 and not enough sustained glucose.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 But when you eat sugar, the glucose half is broken off and the fructose lags a little bit in being absorbed.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 That's why it's a safer sugar for diabetics, fructose or white sugar or fruits.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 Yeah, and so the glucose from the fructose gets absorbed, and then the smaller amount of fructose coming in accelerates the absorption

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 of the glucose by the various tissues, not just the liver, but brain, kidney, heart, everything.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 And so it's fulfilling some of insulin's responsibility without having to call on the insulin,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 but it actually, under some circumstances, can inhibit the release of insulin so that it prevents the spiking of insulin

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 and takes care of insulin's work in the relative absence of insulin.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 So because, again, to explain to our listeners, a diabetic's problem is that they have high sugar, a lot of sugar in their blood,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 and they need their cells to pick that up.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 And when the fructose is combined with the glucose, the fructose is actually helping the cells pick up the glucose as well as the fructose.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 Is that what you're explaining, Dr. Peat?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 Yeah, it stimulates the cells to take up glucose very much the way insulin does.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 And, in fact, you can't distinguish the effects on some of the crucial enzymes that handle the absorption and use of glucose.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Fructose and the pyruvic acid that it turns into stimulate the enzymes that oxidize pyruvic acid just the same way insulin stimulates that same enzyme.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 So really, one replaces the other perfectly.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 And if a diabetic eats a whole grain or beans or any other starchy type of foods,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 then they don't have the same ability to use that sugar because it's mainly in the form of glucose,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 and so then they end up with elevated sugar numbers.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 And elevated insulin to handle that.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 Or not if they're insulin dependent.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 But the funny thing I think, just to go back to this counterculture, is diabetics are told avoid orange juice, avoid sugar, white sugar, and eat whole grains.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 And that's exactly the opposite of what I've seen work in our clinic with diabetics.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 Because when diabetics avoid the grains and the starches, even if they're whole grains and beans and root vegetables,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 and they eat the honeys, the white sugars, and the fruits, their sugar numbers become much more manageable.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Yeah, and it was in 1874 that someone first published a paper on the fact that fructose is metabolized by diabetics, where glucose isn't.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 And at the same time, people were applying the use of sucrose therapeutically for diabetics.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 But after the publication of the paper showing that diabetics can metabolize fructose,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 it was fairly common for people to recommend use of fructose or sucrose to diabetics rather than plain glucose.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 I think another thing too that happens with sugary foods is you don't often find a food that just has white sugar or honey in it.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 It's usually a sugar or honey with a carbohydrate.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 And that's where I think the diabetics get into problems with eating so-called sweet foods.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 And worse than that, polyunsaturated fats are very often combined as shortening in bakery products, for example.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 Right, okay, so that brings us to our good example and our bad example of sugar and fat.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 And then, of course, the sugar needs to be eaten with a fat as well as a protein,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 which is what one of our listeners asked me specifically to talk about tonight.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 The enzyme I mentioned before, pyruvic dehydrogenase, which is activated by insulin or by fructose to handle the oxidation of glucose,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 that happens to be activated also by saturated fatty acids, but it's inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 And the big overall diet change in the U.S. over the last 40 years has been contrary to what a lot of people are saying.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 It's been a slight decrease in sugar, a slight increase in starch consumption, and a big 7% increase in added fats to foods.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 And most of those fats are unsaturated because of the fear of saturated fats.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 And the cheapness. Now it's a cheapness, isn't it?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 The corn oil and safflower oil, all those unsaturated fats, canola, everything, but every liquid vegetable apart from olive oil, basically, is...

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 It's growing en masse.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 Is...

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 Hectoes and hectoes.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 You're right.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 Already in the 1960s, the polyunsaturated fats were recognized to be the diabetogenic factors.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 They interfere with the ability to oxidize glucose.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 It's more recently that they've seen that they specifically inhibit the enzyme which is activated by fructose and insulin.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 And don't they also destroy the pancreatic beta cells that produce the insulin?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 Every place you look, the polyunsaturated fats contribute to diabetes and obesity.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 That's a good point and question. Dr. Peat, what's your opinion on the possibility of regenerating islet cells in the pancreas?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Sugar itself, sucrose, is known to stimulate the regeneration of beta cells.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 That was in my newsletter about a year ago, describing the early treatment of diabetes with glucose

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 and then looking at the new in vitro studies in which sugar stimulates the regeneration and polyunsaturated fats kill the beta cells.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 And sugar often gets the blame for many other things that the polyunsaturated fats do, such as the glycation of hemoglobin,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 which they measure as a way of...

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 HbA1c.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 But most of the glycation, so-called, is really the oxidative breakdown fragments of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 So a person's HbA1c, for example, could be lowered if they avoided all polyunsaturated oils.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Yeah.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Because then they'll be able to use their sugars better.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 So we came up with a really bad example of a way to eat sugar, and that's a donut fried in canola oil or sunflower oil or corn oil.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 Hold that thought a minute, because I know you probably go straight on to it.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 I just want to let people know that you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMUV Gallivoo, 91.1 FM.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 either related or unrelated, to this month's Part 2 subject on sugar.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 And Dr. Peat is our guest speaker.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 And so, Sarah, would you like to carry on?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 Oh, I'd better get the number out. Sorry, I'm rushing ahead.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 The number, if you live in the area, is 923-3911.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 And if you live outside the area, it's 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 That's 1-800-568-3723.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 So a really bad example would be, you know, a donut made from white flour with also lots of fat in the donut.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 I think donut mixtures also have fat, so probably it would be shortening,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 which would be a corn oil, hydrogenated corn oil or something, and then fried in a liquid vegetable oil.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 So you not only have pure glucose, but then you have pure polyunsaturated fatty acids

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 that are blocking your cells using any of that pure glucose.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 And a good example, Dr. Peat said, was ice cream with fruit, fresh fruit.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 So there you go, there's the saturated fat and the fructose.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 Very practical application.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Okay, another question for you, Dr. Peat.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 Also, there was another part in your article that caught my attention,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 and it was surrounding fat peroxidation, so oxidation of fats involved in the degenerative disease process.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Despite the fructose increasing the production of uric acid,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 and you mentioned uric acid was an endogenous, that is, we manufactured it ourselves, anti-inflammatory.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 It's considered to be our main antioxidant, and most of the inflammatory signals come from oxidative breakdown products.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 And so it's our basic antioxidant and a major anti-inflammatory factor.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 But the breakdown of these polyunsaturates or the oxidation of those has a very strong inflammatory effect.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 Is that...?

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 Yeah.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 But the fish oil type breaks down much faster than the seed oils,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 and by the time it gets from your food into your bloodstream,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 there is so much free radical activity that it poisons some of your enzymes involved in immunity.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 And it's the anti-immune suppressive effect that people see as an anti-inflammatory effect of the fish oil type of fats.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 The other, the seed oil fats, don't even have that temporary toxic apparent benefit.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Flat out inflammatory.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 Okay.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 And then the last point that caught my attention was that,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 and this is a specific piece of experimentation that conclusively showed this effect,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 was that people that were given a 300-calorie drink containing either glucose or fructose or OJ, orange juice, separately,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 so 300 calories containing glucose or fructose or orange juice,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 those that received the glucose had a large increase in the oxidative inflammatory stress producing reactive oxygen species

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 and a product nucleofactor cap of beta.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 But it was absent in those receiving the 300-calorie drink with just fructose or just OJ.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 Yeah, that has lots of ramifications, including the immune system,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 which they were looking at some white blood cells,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 but bone cells are very responsive to the difference in carbohydrate.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 And about 35 years ago, someone fed different groups of rats either a high starch diet or a high sugar diet.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 I think it was sucrose in that case, and gave two of the groups a vitamin D deficient diet,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 and another group got the vitamin D and the standard food ration.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 And after they had been on that diet for a while, they tested the strength of their bones,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 and the vitamin D deficient diet that got starch had the rickett-type bones, poorly calcified, weak,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 and basically defective as you would expect from a vitamin D deficiency.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 But those on the high sucrose diet without vitamin D had strong, well-calcified bones.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 Surprisingly, it apparently was the increased carbon dioxide production from the catalyzed higher metabolic rate,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 and the carbon dioxide is largely responsible for proper calcification of bone.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 So does the higher CO2 content actually allow extracellular calcium to move into bone stores?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Yeah, the first bone material laid down is calcium carbonate, even though later it turns to a phosphate compound.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 And in vitro experiments showed that you can have an acidic condition as long as it's based on carbon dioxide as the acid,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 and have strong bones, and the same amount of lactic acid, pH, will cause interruption and dissolution of the bones.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 So it's the fact that starch tends to produce a shift towards lactic acid rather than carbon dioxide.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 Now, this is why you say that oxidative exercise like aerobics or jogging is bad for you,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 because the stress that that causes is counterproductive to calcium being laid down?

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Yeah, exercise coaches, it's taken about 40 years for the science to get to the trainers,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 but the East Europeans were the first ones to limit the training their athletes did,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 and they won a lot of Olympic medals by under-training.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Because the whole aerobic exercise puts too much stress on the body?

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 Yeah, the testosterone goes down and the cortisol goes up, and you lose tissue and speed and coordination.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 So do they do a different type of exercise for their athletes?

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 Yeah, cutting the exercise short before the lactic acid rises, enough to poison the right hormones.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 Which, I mean, isn't that long in aerobic exercises? It's like a couple minutes.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 Yeah, a minute or two is enough.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 A minute or two at a high heart rate, then followed by a break to let the heart rate go back down?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 Yeah, and to get the lactic acid under control, because it turns on the stress hormones that destroy your muscles and nerves and bones.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 And the other downside of the aerobic exercises that you constantly bring up is that you deplete your own CO2 stores.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 Yeah, by taking too much oxygen, which is another point that oxygen is not always a good guy.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 I know we need it to live, to breathe, etc., but it's not the thing we need to be striving for.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 I think most people that we see in labs, most people's CO2 is fairly low.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 The typical well-trained long-distance runner has been found to have basically defective lung function,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 because the chronic elevation of the lactic acid causes a thickening of the air sacs,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 making the path of oxygen diffusion longer, and so it poorly oxygenates their blood.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Wow. So is it a type of fibrosis from inflammation, or is it a different mechanism?

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 No, just, I think, water-logging.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 Right, okay.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 The lactic acid does lead first to water-logging, inflammation, and eventually to fibrosis.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 Okay, well, you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMU DeGarboville, 91.1 FM.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 And from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic on sugars.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 The number, if you live in the area, is 923 3911.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 Or if you live outside the area, it's 1-800-568-3723.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 That's 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 Okay, so to carry on with sugars, then.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 I think what we probably should bring out again is that the brown sugar movement,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 the hip and trendy replacement to what was maligned early on as the white sugar by many people.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 So it was a hip thing to produce brown sugar, raw sugar, molasses, etc., etc.,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 and it was a health food replacement, making a better replacement for the white sugar that we always had before.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 Say a little bit about brown sugar, because brown sugar itself is not particularly good, is it?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 In an extreme situation of poverty, the crude brown foods, brown bread, brown rice, brown sugar, or molasses,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 those are definitely important sources of nutrients.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 When people start eating more fat and protein, they can tend to lose the nutrients in those,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 and they're gaining some freedom from toxins and inflammation when they reduce those brown substances.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 In molasses, for example, it turns brown partly because the sugars are being caramelized.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 The minerals combined with heat and oxygen for dehydrating the juices, the minerals catalyze the oxidation,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 and you get reactions combining sugar molecules and changing them,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 and these become, to various degrees, toxic or pro-inflammatory, allergenic.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 And even potentially carcinogenic, that's correct, huh?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Yeah.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 We've all heard about the carcinogenic effect of a burnt piece of toast

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 or eating too many French fries that are really browned, and it's the same with brown sugar.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 It's the caramelization of the sugar that causes the allergenic and carcinogenic effect.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 Okay, we've got our first caller on the air, so let's take our first caller.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Hi, I heard you talking about sugar.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 My son's 34 now, and he drives me nuts about his sugar intake, because I think sugar is really bad for you.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 When we go out, like to have breakfast or something, he will pour the sugar holder into his coffee.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 And I said, you know, don't you know that it causes diabetes or it affects diabetes and your teeth?

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 And he's had kidney stunts, but whatever I say isn't going to hit him, and he just, you know, keeps using sugar.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 So I don't understand, because I didn't raise him particularly on a sugar-heavy diet.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 I believed in natural foods and everything.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 And so is there any information where I can get some that would, you know, influence him about the bad things about sugar?

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 There's a natural tendency of people who have some hormone imbalance, especially hypothyroidism,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 which makes your liver unable to store glycogen effectively.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 It causes a natural craving for sugar.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 Glycogen, just so you know, is a storage form of sugar.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 You take in dietary sugars and then it's converted to glycogen, so where everybody can store it up for later on?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Uh-huh.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Okay.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 I was always extremely craving sugar.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 So was I.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 And generally eating a lot until I took thyroid.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 I was probably about 40 years old when I first took thyroid.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 Uh-huh.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 And I suddenly had no more sugar cravings.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 I could go eight hours without getting terribly hungry or shaky or thinking about sweet things.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 Uh-huh.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 Well, that's good to know.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 Well, I'll just have to tell him, you know, he's got to ask his doctor.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 He said he's been tested for diabetes and he doesn't have it, but, you know, it's unhealthy what he's doing,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 pouring sugar into, you know, coffee.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 And I don't know if that's just to irritate me or, you know, but it's obviously he doesn't care and he thinks it's cool.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 And still he's had kidney stones.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 Aren't those influenced by sugar?

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 No, I don't think so.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 No?

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 Okay.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 Only in the sense of negative--

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 I can hardly hear you, doctor.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 When you aren't eating enough minerals, for example,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 if you let the sugar displace sources of calcium and magnesium and protein, then you do tend to form stones.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 The parathyroid hormone and other inflammatory things tend to create mineralization of soft tissues and formation of stones in the kidneys, bladder, and gallbladder.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 Wow.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 So what would be the test that would give him the information he needs?

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 Well, a vitamin D--

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Vitamin D.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 -- serum test for vitamin D3 is one relevant thing.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 I've had that.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 Well, and mine came out all normal and everything, so I don't know.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 But anyway, that's good information.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 I will pass it on to my son.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 And the fact that he's adding that white sugar to his coffee is probably protective because coffee lowers your blood sugar,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 and if you have just pure black coffee, you'll actually end up lowering your blood sugar.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 And if he's someone who's craving a lot of sugars, that's probably why he's just figured it out that if he has coffee, he better have sugar with it because it makes him feel better.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 Yeah, I take my coffee black, so I don't know.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 It's really weird for me.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 And it's going to be easier for his body to use the white sugar than it would be a big pile of pancakes.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 But he probably just craves all types of sugars, whether they come from starches or sugar.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 Is he quite lean?

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 No, and he works really, really hard, but he's stocky.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 He doesn't -- I don't know.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 I know he likes ice cream and stuff, but it's mainly what I just see him dump, like a sugar shaker into coffee.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 And we could be in an organic restaurant or whatever and having healthy foods, and he's still got to have that sugar fix.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 Well, his body's obviously telling him something.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 Yeah.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 He could get his thyroid checked and his vitamin D checked, and that would be a good place to start.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 Yeah, that would be a good start.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Well, thank you so much for your help.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 I really appreciate it.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 You're very welcome.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 All right, bye-bye.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 Bye-bye.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 Okay, well, we have another caller on the air, so let's take this one.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 You're on the air.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 Hello.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 Hi, guys.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 This is Kesha.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 Hi, Kesha.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 Hello.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 Well, first I just want to really tell you how much I appreciate you guys bringing this information to the airways,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 and I really want to encourage the listeners to really listen with an open heart

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 and kind of put everything you've heard your whole life in the background

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 and just take in the information that has it come, because this isn't readily available information.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 But to get back to that previous caller, you know, about the whole sugar with the coffee and whatnot,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 maybe you could expound a little bit more on the whole key of balance

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 and how when you do eat, consume sugar, how it is important to have it with the proper amount of fat

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 and protein to slow down, you know, the release of the sugar, and vice versa.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 If you're going to have protein, you need the sugar to help the body utilize

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 or be able to utilize and break down the protein, as you know what I'm saying.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 Exactly.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 So anyway, I just wanted to encourage you guys to clarify that even more so that people really, as they do tune in,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 even if they tune in to the middle of the show and they hear all these great things about sugar,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 go back to the balance and also, you know, I think it's great how you were explaining to add sugar into the coffee

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 to help boost up your blood sugar, you know, and all of that.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 But anyway, I just want to thank you guys a lot.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 Okay. Dr. Peat?

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 Thank you for your call, Tashian.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 Yeah.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 Dr. Peat, can you explain -- sorry, Andrew -- can you explain why it's so important to have a protein,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 to have it with fruit or honey or sugar because of the blood sugar lowering effect of the protein?

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 Yeah, the amino acids in the protein themselves are strong stimulants of the insulin secretion.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 And when you don't take in sugar, the insulin to dispose of the protein will lower your blood sugar.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 And to prevent the blood sugar going down, you tend to produce either adrenaline or cortisol or both.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 And if your liver didn't have the glycogen stored to release glucose under the influence of adrenaline,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 then you depend on cortisol to keep your blood sugar steady, and cortisol activates the conversion of protein to sugar and fat.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 And so you've destroyed a big part of the protein that you've just eaten.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 I've seen people who were eating a couple of pounds of meat a day who were having signs of protein deficiency

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 and getting fat.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 So to handle the protein efficiently, you need the glucose to make sure that your insulin isn't lowering your blood sugar.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 You need either glucose or fructose to steady your blood sugar.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 And the fat does several things. The saturated fat works with fructose and insulin to handle your oxidation of the glucose.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 And the fat also slows the absorption so that you don't get a surge of glucose in your blood from eating, say, a coffee with sugar.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 And the coffee, like the glucose, stimulates your metabolic rate.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 And both of those, by increasing your metabolic rate, are going to increase your general nutritional requirements.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 Minerals and all of the vitamins have to be adequate.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 And if you substitute the sugar for things like fruit, milk, cheese, shellfish, eggs, and so on, then you're very likely to become deficient.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 Biotin and vitamin B6 and panthenic acid and selenium and copper are things that are among the first to become deficient if you try to run on too much coffee and sugar and not enough food.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 So, yeah, as much as the fructose helps people's cells pick up the sugar and there's all these anti-inflammatory effects from eating fructose or fruit or honey or sugar,

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 everything has to be kept in a balance, is what I guess you're trying to say here, Dr. Peate, with the correct nutritional balance of proteins and good saturated fats, coconut oil and butter.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 Otherwise, you will suffer a deficiency from either too much protein or too many sugars.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Okay, well, just so people can get a list of some of the top fructose sources that also don't just have fructose.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 They have fructose and glucose, but they're things that you'd expect, like dates.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 Dates are 32% fructose.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 They contain B vitamins, potassium, calcium, and iron.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 I know, Dr. Peate, you're not too big on iron because iron is a particularly inflammatory iron.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 But when it's with the other minerals, it does help protect you from overloading on iron.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 Yeah, we're not talking about over-iron consumption.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 Okay, and then raisins.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 Raisins are in the same kind of group as dates.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 They're 30% fructose, antioxidant-rich.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 And then agave.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 Now, what do you think about agave?

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 Agave nectar has been touted as a very good replacement.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 It actually contains about 43% fructose, as well as the fructans, the polymers of fructose.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 And they're also found in asparagus and artichokes.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 Yeah, the fact that they mentioned the fructans, I think probably means that it's being produced enzymically from the core of the agave plant

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 rather than from the juice.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 Because that's a waste product, if you like, is it?

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 Yeah.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 Of tequila production.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 Yeah.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 They're using spent raw material.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 And so, Dr., can you give us some examples of some good food combining for protein, fat, and good sugar?

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 Oh, fruit and cheese would be a basic thing for snacks as well as meals.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 Grapes and cheese.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 Actually, we have another caller on the air, so let's take this other caller.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 Hi, yes, great show.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 First, I wanted to mention, Dr. Peat, whatever you did when that woman said that she couldn't hear you,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 I haven't heard you better on this show than when whatever you did was that.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 So keep doing it.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 I know Michael McCaskill does everything he can to keep everyone's levels good,

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 but I have a little trouble hearing to start with, and sometimes it is hard to hear your wisdom,

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 and I really appreciate what you bring to the air.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 You know, it's come up in recent news reports that it seems like under constant attack are the natural substances on the earth,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 what with raw food being attacked by the food rallies and the federal forces going in and dumping this raw milk,

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 and then what's going on recently with medicinal marijuana here after Obama told us it was going to be left alone

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 if it was legal in the states where it was legal.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 I understand Phoenix and states all along the west in Colorado, and of course right here in our own backyard, have been attacked.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 It always amazes me that the people who put out chemical concoctions cooked up in a lab somewhere,

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 call it Vioxx, say it's safe and kill a bunch of people before it's taken off the market but nobody goes to jail,

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 versus the people who are taken to jail because their food is inherently dangerous when it's natural.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 I don't get it, but you guys are on the front lines, and I really, really appreciate you bringing it back to Mother Nature

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 and bringing it home because this is provided for us, and you all are explaining what it does as it's been provided for, so thank you.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 I wanted to ask specifically about dextrose.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 Dextrose, from what I gather in my research, is basically that spoonful of sugar that helps the medicine go down

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 because I don't see dextrose mixed in with much of anything else but medicine.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 I'm curious as to the function and purpose of dextrose, what it's really all about.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 Also, since Steve Jobs recently passed and pancreatic cancer was related to that,

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 I understand he used to stay up for days at a time working on his inventions, a lot of coffee,

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 but he also ate a lot of health food.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 Maybe you could address the aspects again of -- because I was having a little trouble hearing this --

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 of what can help regenerate those pancreatic cells and what can adversely affect them as far as benefits of coffee

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 and keeping that in balance.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 So dextrose and pancreas, that's kind of the basic questions, and thanks again for all that every one of you do.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
 Thank you.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 Thank you, Dr. Eccle.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
 Dr. Peat.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 What do you think of dextrose, Dr. Peat?

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 Well, glucose, it's just the other word for glucose, and starch turns into that.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:19.000
 It's great stuff in itself when it's in the right balance with other things,

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 including a little bit of fructose always and saturated fat and minerals and vitamins.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 The dextrose or glucose itself is a factor in helping the pancreas to regenerate.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 It's the polyunsaturated fats which misdirect the metabolism of glucose and fructose,

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:53.000
 and the polyunsaturated fats that are creating the epidemic of diabetes and obesity

00:50:53.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 and later all of the degenerative diseases, cancer and Alzheimer's and so on.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 This is your engineer.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 I have a question.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 Do they call it dextrose when it's being used industrially instead of a food,

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 or how do they call it dextrose instead of glucose?

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 It just has to do with the optical rotation of it.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 It's just a different chemical history of the way they name the molecules.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 Fructose was called levulose because it turns the light to the left.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 Okay, so basically dextrose just gets broken down into glucose.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 It is glucose.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 It is glucose, okay.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 There's another caller on the air, so let's take this next caller.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 Hello, is that me?

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 You're on the air, yeah.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000
 Hi, yeah.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 I would like to ask the doctor, okay, I've stopped eating meat, beef,

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 basically I ate a little bit of lamb and I ate a little bit of pork

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 and I ate a lot of fish.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 I stopped drinking coffee.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 I stopped using mostly butter, and I stopped using milk altogether.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 And I'm curious about what is--because I have this lower back condition,

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 but I don't have the arthritis anymore that I had from basically from beef

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:30.000
 which I think was like--I call it uric acid.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:37.000
 But I have like a lower back condition and kind of a hip condition.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 And I was curious if there was--I take vitamin D3.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:50.000
 I take soluble B12, which is good.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 I'm kind of curious about what would be good, because I don't use sugar at all.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 I mean, if I use anything, I use a little bit of honey, but like that.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 Anyway, I'm going to get off of the thing here and--

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 Wait a minute.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 --let's go in the air.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 Can you stay on the air because I think Dr. Peat might have some questions for you.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 Okay, but I can't hear.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 Oh, right.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 Can you turn him up a little bit?

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 Okay, Dr. Peat, can you try to talk especially loud for this next caller here?

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 I'll see.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:37.000
 Honey has all of the virtues of ordinary sucrose,

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000
 and it has some special benefits such as antiseptic materials

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 that the bees collect from the flowers.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 But basically--

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 I also understand that there was some old Chinese princesses that were preserved in honey

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 that are still like okay, and honey is still edible.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 Yeah, ordinary white sugar has many of those same properties.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 They've done major surgery, like chest surgery, where they didn't have antibiotics,

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000
 and they just filled the hole with white crystalline sugar,

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:23.000
 and the person recovered and had fewer scars than would have happened if they had used antibiotics.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 Really?

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 That's fascinating.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 Honey has--

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 That's fascinating.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 Yeah, I've got some of the references in my Diabetes and Sugar Newsletter.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 Did you hear my questions?

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 Yeah, I think you probably had a slight weakness of thyroid function.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 Meat eaters often get--if they eat too much meat in relation to their thyroid function,

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 they'll often get symptoms including arthritis.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:09.000
 And the low back symptoms are very common in a thyroid problem.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 So you want to check your temperature and pulse rate

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 and maybe have your thyroid function checked.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 But sometimes just a daily raw carrot will help make up for the thyroid deficiency

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 by reducing the bacterial toxins that poison your liver and interfere with thyroid function.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 Okay, and what about kidney?

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 Same thing.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 The endotoxin absorbed from poorly digested plant material is the main thing.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 The endotoxin interferes with glucose or sugar oxidation

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 and prevents the activation of the thyroid hormone.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:03.000
 And then that leads to all of the inflammatory things,

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 and especially cartilage, the discs between vertebrae tend to swell or become soft

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:20.000
 when you're thyroid deficient and having endotoxin.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 What I was saying was that I stopped taking any basic dairy.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:33.000
 I do a little butter and a little bit of yogurt, but I don't do any milk.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 I don't do any beef.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 What about eggs?

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 I don't do any--pardon me?

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 Eggs.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 Eggs. No, I eat eggs maybe twice a week.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 You want to try to get at least 80 grams of good protein every day.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000
 Oh, yeah. No, no, I understand the protein.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 I eat lamb.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 I eat a lot of fish and stuff, but I stopped doing milk, coffee, sugar, white sugar, and beef basically.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 What about fruit like orange juice?

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 I'm not too into orange juice.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 I can use it, but it tends to make me rather phlegmy in my throat.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:25.000
 Well, dates and grapes, raisins, I love all that stuff.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.000
 Yeah, then--

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 And I eat them a lot.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:37.000
 Calcium would be the main thing to concentrate on if you're eating enough fish and lamb and eggs.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000
 Okay.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 You should maybe try powdering eggshells.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000
 Okay, you know what?

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 I'm sorry to have to break in here.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000
 Yeah, okay.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
 I'm going to get out of here and get somebody else on.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 No, no, we've only got two minutes left, so we need to--

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 Wrap up the show.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 We need to thank Dr. Peat for his generous time and his wisdom.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 Thank you, Dr. Peat, so much for joining us.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
 Okay.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.000
 Okay, so people that have heard this evening's show with Dr. Peat, please go check his website.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.000
 www.raypeat.com

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:20.000
 There's lots of scientific reference articles to back up everything that you've heard this evening and much, much more.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 So his website is always a good source of impartial information, and some of it, obviously, whilst counterculture,

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
 it's just open your eyes, folks.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000
 It's out there just for the looking and for those of you who have ears to hear.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000
 So until the third Friday of November--

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 We've still got a minute and a half.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.000
 There's only we're going to cut off too short, but until the third Friday of next month, November--

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000
 November 18th.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000
 November the 18th.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 That'll be-- The clocks will be going back, and it'll be dark when we come in.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
 So for those people--

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 Okay, our phone number.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
 Let's just tell people our phone number, shall we?

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000
 Okay, our number's-- Sarah, how about you want to say it?

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000
 There you go.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:10.000

 Thank you for your time.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.000
 And don't forget Pledge Drive for UK Mudd listeners.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
 Pledge Drive is coming up next week.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.000
 I think it was the 26th of October.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000
 Is that right, Michael?

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000
 Yeah, October 26th.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.000
 Great.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:44.000
 So those people that have heard and listened, how about pledging a little bit to help KMUDD keep doing what we're doing?

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.000
 Okay.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000
