00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 From the Hill Country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 Hello, welcome to our two of our little show here.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.800
 Dr. Ray Peat has a PhD in biology from University of Oregon.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.800
 He specialized in physiology.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 He's taught at schools like University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.800
 Natural College of Naturopathic Medicine, University of Dadaad in Bataclues,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.800
 and some other places in Mexico that I can't pronounce.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.800
 He started his work with progesterone and related hormones at 68.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.800
 He did papers on those and all kinds of pretty geeky things when it comes to the body.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.800
 And he's been studying these things since that for a long time.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.800
 Has quite a following around the world.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.800
 His website is raypeat.com and we're honored to have him back because we have lots of good questions for him.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800
 Well, good morning, Dr. Peat.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.800
 Good morning.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 How are things out there on the left coast?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.800
 It's been sunny the last couple of days.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.800
 Really? We just talked to Dave Stetzer that had a couple feet of global warming on the ground there in Wisconsin.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.800
 Dr. Peat, how do you spend your days generally up there with you?

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.800
 Usually reading.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.800
 Reading. How do you know when you read all this stuff?

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 How do you know what's kind of like right or medium or fake news?

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.800
 I mean, how do you know?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:10.800
 When I first went to college, I was a literature English major for several years.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.800
 I specialized in English literature mostly.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:32.800
 And doing that, you learn how to really interpret who a person is just from fairly short passages of their writing.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:42.800
 You can tell pretty much what their philosophy is, what their mind is like just from the way they make a few sentences.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:03:02.800
 And starting almost 100 years ago, science and medical journals started imposing a way of writing that creates the impression that there's no person present.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 And despite that stylized, impersonal, so-called objective way of writing, at some level you can detect the mind of the person behind those pseudo-objective sentences.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:29.800
 And I think of science and medical writing as political propaganda writing.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.800
 It's the same as reading the newspaper.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:43.800
 You know it's going to be 90% lies, but you figure out the motives, why they chose that subject to write on.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:56.800
 And the motives will explain the way they use their terms, the assumptions they make, and the conclusions, the way they draw conclusions from the evidence.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:07.800
 Very interesting. Similar to, I guess, that people have begun to discern just fake news in general when it comes to politics or science or whatever.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.800
 Much better than 20 or 30 years ago.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.800
 But still, most people are gullible.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.800
 Like what they're saying about Venezuela.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.800
 Yeah, right.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.800
 It has the biggest oil and gold deposit in the world.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.800
 And it's democracy we're interested in.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.800
 I know, just isn't it interesting to watch that.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.800
 And all these countries that have gathered up and said, "Oh yeah, this new guy, he's our guy, you know, he's our guy."

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.800
 It's very curious, isn't it, when it comes to money.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800
 Oh boy, yes indeed.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.800
 You can just spot it. I mean, I smell it, you know, a lot.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.800
 But I've studied the money thing for quite a few years.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.800
 So I guess after you study things for a long time, like I've done with the financial world for 25 years,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.800
 you just kind of, like you said, you kind of smell it, right?

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.800
 You just kind of intuit that the people have a particular position one way or another.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:11.800
 Yeah, yeah. Dietitians and doctors writing about statins or other drugs.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.800
 Sure, yeah.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:24.800
 What are some of the subjects that you get, like, you know, just top of the line interest in these days, Dr. Peat?

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.800
 Parts of organs or parts of the body or particular illnesses.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:37.800
 Do you see some things keep showing up in number one, two, three, like over the last year or so that kind of spark for you?

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.800
 Always hair loss and obesity are the most common.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.800
 But there's an awful lot of cancer recently.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.800
 Cancer is displacing heart disease in the people I've been talking to.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:12.800
 And two or three days ago, I heard from a veteran who had had 20 vaccinations and then had immune suppression therapy and then developed cancer.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:21.800
 I think the things we're being exposed to are creating cancer in young people.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.800
 It isn't being publicized because people generally think about an age-related cancer.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:37.800
 But just in the last 10 years, there's been a big surge in cancer in the 20s and 30s and 40s.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.800
 Air, food and water, the basics are getting toxic.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:57.800
 The combination of lots of PUFA in the diet, lots of radiation, tongue cancer is practically an epidemic compared to what it used to be.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:10.800
 Tongue cancer, tonsil cancer, eye cancer, thyroid and brain cancer from combination of cell phones around the head and dental x-rays.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.800
 Wow. Tongue cancer, is that a source of that? Do we know?

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.800
 I think oral x-rays are probably the best explanation for that.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.800
 Oh, they over x-ray when you go in and...

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:54.800
 Yeah, they talk about the new sensitive instruments that don't make as much radiation per exposure, but then they give you panoramic scenery x-rays that make dozens of exposures even though each one is low exposure, but some of them is much more than people used to get.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.800
 Yeah, a cinemascope and whatever, they really go for it now.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.800
 Oh, me darn.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:09.800
 If you have a question for Ray P, we have lots of emails already, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:33.800
 Several emails after your last show and folks were wondering why you were suggesting possibly the synthetic hormone replacement rather than the pig nature authority.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.800
 Nature authority, is that how you say it?

00:08:35.800 --> 00:09:04.800
 Oh, I don't know about that particular brand, but there are now lots of desiccated thyroid planned products available, but 100 years ago and up until the 90s, the Armour Company was the main producer of desiccated thyroid and there were a couple other companies that made extremely good products,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.800
 but they were testing every batch.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:23.800
 They took it from beef and pork both and you could get the type you wanted or a mixture, but every batch was standardized in potency by testing it on mice.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:38.800
 In the 90s, that stopped and then one of the major producers started extracting and selling thyrocalcitonin from the powder.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:52.800
 So you can't tell whether the powder is the entire gland the way it used to be 100 years ago when all of the great research was being done.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:10:03.800
 Now, you're likely to get a fractionated extract from the thyroid gland and since they don't standardize it on mice.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:15.800
 In Mexico, I got some thyroid glands from the slaughterhouse and found that they had almost no thyroid activity.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:21.800
 Something had been in the animal feed apparently that ruined their thyroid.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:36.800
 So if you aren't standardizing the product, the only way you can tell what you're getting is to get a good batch of a particular product and then test it on yourself.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:49.800
 With a natural product, it takes about two months of adjusting the dose to really know how much you should be taking.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:11:02.800
 With two or three good synthetic products, they are adjusted to a standard.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:11.800
 For example, I've been using CINO+ which was based on armor thyroid composition.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:20.800
 I've been using this one product for about 30 years and the potency hasn't noticeably changed.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.800
 And so there's no issues with the fact that it's a synthetic as far as you can tell?

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:38.800
 Yeah, it was designed by the armor thyroid company itself to imitate their own armor thyroid USP.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:45.800
 And now the synthetic is continuing that same composition.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:12:03.800
 And new companies that try to make T3 or T4 or the combination, if they don't test it on some animal, those materials are very hard to keep functional in a pill.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:18.800
 And so with those, if you don't use the well-known products such as Thyrol-R or CINO+, then it's a matter of testing those over a period of a few weeks.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.800
 I see. Very interesting.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:37.800
 So you're willing as a researcher and when you talk to people, if there's any downside at all and are you pretty sure there's not with the downside of the synthetic to do that because you're more sure you're getting exactly what you need or want?

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:47.800
 Yeah, I hear almost every day one or two stories of bad results with a so-called glandular.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:56.800
 There are lots of things that can go wrong with the glandular.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:16.800
 For example, they'll put additives in it or desiccated liver along with the desiccated gland and chemicals either in the liver or the other additives can alter the effect of the thyroid.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:32.800
 Yeah, I guess if you really thought about it deeply without getting too dark, if the animals are being fed antibiotics or growth hormones or even GMO grain or something, that could affect the thyroid as well, I guess.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:41.800
 Oh, yeah. If they give them fattening diets with lots of PUFA, that blocks the thyroid.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:50.800
 Maybe they need to make an organic desiccated thyroid or something. I don't know. Wow, very interesting.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:59.800
 We had a question. I have an email here that the lady wanted to understand more about the desiccated thyroid.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:08.800
 She has a 60 grain and it gives you so much T4 and so much T3. I had the numbers here that she wrote.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.800
 Yeah, they usually say 9 and 38.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800
 Right.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:22.800
 But as far as I can tell, those numbers are something that the FDA told them to put on the label.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.800
 Oh, good. Yeah. It's not necessarily what it is.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:51.800
 That's my impression because unless you standardize it on an animal, if you just do the tests on the actual pill, the desiccated thyroid, a chemist several years ago took a product from Thailand and saw on the label,

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:59.800
 it said 18 and 76 micrograms of the substances.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.800
 He tested for those and found zero in the product.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.800
 Zero?

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:17.800
 Zero, yeah. And I explained that that's normal. The gland should contain zero T3 and zero T4.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:30.800
 But when we eat it, we digest it and produce the digestive process creates those hormones when you eat the gland.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:52.800
 So he hydrolyzed the pills with acid, then tested it and they did have exactly what they claimed, but it's simply false. An FDA fiction to put on a glandular product that it contains T3 and T4.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.800
 The FDA really is that ignorant. They don't know what they're doing.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.800
 Yeah. Well, surprise, surprise, Dr. Peat.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:07.800
 You know what? I want to do a quick break and I'm going to call you back on a different line. I'm getting some clicks and clunks.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.800
 I'm not sure. Have you heard them?

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.800
 You're sounding fuzzy.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.800
 Yeah. I think it's this line. I'm hopefully that on a new line, it's going to be clear.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.800
 So if you would hang up, I'm going to call you back directly.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.800
 You'll hear a commercial plane when you pick up.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.800
 And I think there's a problem with the line I'm on. Okay?

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.800
 All right. Let's do that.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.800
 One of the fun and easy things we do with this Pearlcium product is brush our teeth with it.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:39.800
 But as we look deeper into this product, taking it internally is really kind of magical.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:46.800
 Calcium metabolism basically affects the whole metabolism and also your whole energetic systems.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:53.800
 Literally, the calcium is the powerhouse for energy and it also carries energy everywhere.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:17:03.800
 So whatever we do, either thinking or doing any work, calcium is a carrier to get the energy over there.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:11.800
 And recently we had a Professor Paul on our show on the electromagnetic fields.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:18.800
 And he explained very clearly how these things were interfering with the proper calcium getting into the cells.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:28.800
 That's fascinating. I completely agree with his research because everything is actually a field, you know, a vibrational field.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.800
 Even our body is a field.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:37.800
 And also Pearl can really alter the whole vibrational field because it has this crystalline structure.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:45.800
 And this crystalline structure carries the most positive energy and also information and matter.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:51.800
 And so when it gets into the body, it can change the completely vibrational field.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.800
 So it can heal us at a very deep level.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.800
 Well, Dr. Rulan Xu, we love the sound of that. Heal us at a deep level.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.800

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:15.800
 Previously with cardiologist Dr. Joel Kahn, 35 years experience in cardiology.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:21.800
 On your commercial break, you hit a hot button because I'm a giant fan of infrared sauna and the cardiac benefits.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.800
 Tell us about why you like these saunas for the heart. What does it do?

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:33.800
 In Japan, it's a traditional therapy of heart disease to even sick heart patients to sit for 15 or 20 minutes in an infrared sauna,

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:39.800
 then lie down and rest and hydrate for about half an hour. They call it "Wa-On." W-A-O-N.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.800
 It means soothing heat. And they've done research studies, like 30 of them, in humans.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.800
 It anti-ages your arteries and improves the strength of your heart.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.800
 And it may actually prolong survival in sick heart patients.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.800
 Anybody can just, again, go to the Internet, read about infrared sauna heart disease,

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.800
 or put my name there because I've written many articles about it.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.800
 Now there's data coming out of Sweden and Finland because they've published some amazing data

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.800
 that the number of times a week you're in a sauna, the number of minutes each time,

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.800
 you can just track out how long you're going to live.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.800
 So, very powerful therapy by being in, my favorite is, an infrared sauna.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:20.800
 Well, I don't know about you, but if the heart muscles and the arteries are happy, things are good.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.800
 Very important. We promote the Relax Far Infrared Sauna.

 Email me for the special price, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.800
 Okay, it is the 19th of February. Dr. Peter, are you there?

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:57.800
 Yes, that ad was very interesting in relation to thyroid because raising your body temperature

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.800
 is one of the basic essential things that the thyroid hormone does.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:08.800
 Broda Barnes, who was a pioneer in the prevention of heart disease,

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:14.800
 judged his thyroid dose for his patients on the basis of their temperature.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:24.800
 If they woke up very far from 98 degrees and didn't rise to 98.6 by the afternoon,

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:31.800
 he would adjust their thyroid dose until that's the way their temperature varied during the day.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:40.800
 And in his long practice of 30 years or so, he didn't have any one of his patients die from heart disease.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.800
 "Solve the Riddle of Heart Attacks" was the name of his book.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.800
 And even if you just warm up your body with a hot bath regularly,

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.800
 that does many of the things that the thyroid hormone does.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:02.800
 And the way that thyroid function is currently being estimated by the medical profession

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:10.800
 all around the world the last 20 years or so on the basis of the thyroid stimulating hormone,

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:20.800
 a pituitary hormone in the blood, that rises when we're deficient in the actual thyroid function.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:27.800
 And when you're correcting the body temperature and keeping your oxygen consumption up,

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:37.800
 your TSH goes very low. A healthy population was found to have no thyroid cancer

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:48.800
 if their TSH was 0.4 or below, in effect below the so-called normal range.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:57.800
 And the TSH itself, the thyroid stimulating hormone, rises when your thyroid is malfunctioning.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.800
 And the TSH promotes inflammation, promotes hypertension,

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:09.800
 the degenerative processes associated with low thyroid function.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.800
 Many of them are directly caused by the TSH,

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:19.800
 yet doctors won't prescribe thyroid until you get extremely high TSH.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.800
 And maybe that's a connection, as you said, on the infrared sauna and the heart and the thyroid

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.800
 and the temperature and all that. That's very interesting. Yeah.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:35.800
 So I'm wondering, so if folks have a high TSH, and you're way down there,

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:43.800
 how do we know if we want to give the body a T4 or T3?

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:50.800
 Really, most people, most men will get along with either of them.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.800
 In the 1940s, when synthetic thyroid came out,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:03.800
 the product was tested on male medical students, men in their early 20s,

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:11.800
 and they found that T4 thyroxin worked just like natural armor thyroid.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.800
 And that was the basis for prescribing it.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:26.800
 But starting in the late '40s, people created the idea that only 5% of the American population

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:33.800
 needed a thyroid supplement because they were testing the blood, not the temperature.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:42.800
 And they found that the iodine in the blood was deficient only in 5%.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.800
 For 20 years, that went on until they discovered that iodine in the blood

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.800
 has no correlation with thyroid function.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.800
 It isn't the thyroid hormone they were measuring.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.800
 That's amazing.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.800
 So they created this horrible myth.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:06.800
 And then as the good tests, such as radio-immunoassay for TSH, as that came out,

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:15.800
 they stretched the normal range to fit the myth that only 5% needed a thyroid supplement.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.800
 Interesting.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.800
 So in general, if folks wanted to get their body temperature up,

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:26.800
 they could either do the T4/T3 combo or just a little bit of the T3

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.800
 and experiment with it and get their body temperature up?

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.800
 Yeah.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.800
 Women--that myth was created on the basis of young men.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.800
 But women of all ages, especially when their estrogen is high,

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.800
 are sometimes extremely insensitive to a T4 supplement.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.800
 Oh, be darned.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.800
 And it can actually lower their thyroid function by suppressing the TSH

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.800
 and turning off the conversion of T4 to T3.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:03.800
 The first thing that got me interested 40 years ago was knowing of a patient

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:09.800
 at the University of Oregon Medical School who was brought in comatose

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:15.800
 because her doctors had started her on 100 micrograms of thyroxine,

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.800
 and she got worse.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:24.800
 They raised it in steps up to 400 micrograms of thyroxine, and she went into a coma.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.800
 And in the hospital, someone knew about the function of the liver and T3,

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:35.800
 gave her T3, immediately she came out of the coma and was normal.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:43.800
 But that shows that the female liver has to convert T4 to T3 like the male liver,

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.800
 but estrogen blocks that process.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:54.800
 So that's why women have about from 5 to 10 times the incidence of thyroid deficiency as men.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.800
 Oh, because of the estrogen in the body.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.800
 Yeah.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:03.800
 We had a gentleman on the show, a Dr. MD type,

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:08.800
 and he was suggesting that if you did a fraction of free T3

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:17.800
 and the bottom number would be the reverse T3, that number wants to be about 20 to 1.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.800
 Does that sound reasonable to you?

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.800
 I think it's probably ideal, but people get along with a much lower ratio.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.800
 A lower ratio.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.800
 And the actual ratio varies from tissue to tissue,

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:41.800
 but if you only have the blood to look at, it's good to have a fairly high ratio of T3 to reverse T3.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.800
 I was reading on your forum, and you gave us the website,

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.800
 and we put that up there, the Mexican place,

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:53.800
 and it seems like a reputable organization where people can just get the T3.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.800
 I think it's like $13 or something.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:01.800
 But I've seen on your forum that folks are actually putting it into a powder

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.800
 and just doing a little bit every few hours, which is kind of clunky,

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.800
 but why doesn't it work if you just take--

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.800
 the T3 is what, 25 micrograms, which is very small,

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.800
 but that's too much to take at one time?

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.800
 Yeah, the liver is the main source, naturally.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.800
 Okay.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:29.800
 And so if we produce, say, 400 micrograms of T4 at maximum--

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.800
 T3 or T4?

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.800
 Of T4, our liver will convert maybe a fourth of that to T3,

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.800
 so at the very maximum, we're getting 100 micrograms per day

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.800
 or a maximum of 4 micrograms per hour,

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.800
 but on average, we're about half that for normal functioning.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:57.800
 And so the normal hourly production should be around 2 micrograms,

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.800
 and if you take 25 at once, the liver experiences that tenfold excess--

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.800
 Not good.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.800
 --and shuts down.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:13.800
 I experimented myself taking 25 micrograms only in the morning,

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:20.800
 and after two weeks, I noticed in the mirror that my thyroid gland--

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:26.800
 there was a depression on each side of my Adam's apple where the gland should be,

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.800
 and it wasn't there.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:34.800
 But the real problem was that at sunset, my heart began stopping.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.800
 Oh, good.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.800
 Ten times per minute, it would stop for a few seconds,

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:50.800
 and there would be a few regular beats and then a pause of two or three beats,

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:55.800
 and I found that when my heart was having those episodes,

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.800
 if I took 10 micrograms of T3 and chewed it up,

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.800
 within about 15 seconds, the perfect rhythm would be back.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:09.800
 And I realized that I had activated my liver enzymes to the point

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:15.800
 that they were throwing off the T3 and creating a profound deficiency

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.800
 in just 12 hours from the single pill.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.800
 But if one was going to use the T3, would they have to do this every couple hours,

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.800
 like for a long time? That's pretty time-consuming, isn't it?

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.800
 Yeah. A friend of mine and his wife were on the train going to Chicago,

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.800
 and he had a heart attack and was rushed to the hospital,

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:41.800
 and they started taking his blood enzymes and showing that part of his heart

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.800
 was dying and releasing enzymes, and they were graphing it,

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:51.800
 showing the steady rise, and they said that would keep up for four days

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.800
 if he survived and would gradually correct itself.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:01.800
 But on the first day, his wife happened to have some T3

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:07.800
 and started giving him one microgram per hour with a glass of orange juice.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:13.800
 And that afternoon, his enzymes started normalizing downhill.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:19.800
 The doctors said that never happened and that he had to stay in the hospital

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.800
 for four days, but he went home and was fine.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:30.800
 Interesting. So I guess could you powder the T3 and then maybe mix it with liquid

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.800
 and dose it out that way?

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.800
 Oh, yeah, getting it finely divided.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.800
 Yeah, how would you do that?

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.800
 Some people just nibble, take a little crumb off the side of a tablet.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:43.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.800
 If you have sharp teeth.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.800
 Or you could powder it and just take a little dose of the powder

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.800
 and maybe get 25 micrograms over the course of the day.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.800
 Yeah, it doesn't have to be exact, just so you don't have those gigantic surges

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.800
 of 10 or 20 micrograms.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.800
 Is there any chance that by doing that that you could help the thyroid along

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.800
 to get better on its own?

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:13.800
 I've seen several people who were doing silly things that suppressed their thyroid.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:19.800
 One doctor, endocrinologist, told her that her thyroid must be dead

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.800
 because she had no thyroid function.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:31.800
 And she started taking thyroid and within a week her whole pituitary had recovered.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.800
 And there are published cases where people do recover their thyroid function

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.800
 just by taking a thyroid supplement.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:44.800
 But it's fairly rare because it's usually not just a short-term stress

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.800
 that has suppressed the gland, but a chronic stress.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.800
 Chronic stress, so it could take a while.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.800
 So again, before we leave the thyroid, I don't want to get bogged down.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.800
 We have so many different places I'd like to go this morning.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:03.800
 The difference in taking T3, which you can get, or the T4, T3,

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:08.800
 the common combination for the body is what, the difference?

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:18.800
 The T4 is only active by conversion to T3, which activates the oxidative heat-producing process.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:25.800
 But the T4, even though it isn't metabolically active, it does act in the pituitary,

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.800
 which can do the conversion locally.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:34.800
 And so it can be therapeutic just by suppressing your TSH.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:42.800
 But you have to take into account the heat production and calorie burning of the T3.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:50.800
 And the T4 takes a long time to equilibrate in the body from any dose that you're taking.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:33:00.800
 It has a half-life in the body of about two weeks, where the T3 has a 12-hour or one-day half-life.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.800
 So you can get up to normal quickly with T3,

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:13.800
 but it takes several weeks to find what your stable response to T4 is going to be.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:19.800
 And one thing I should mention, I got an email yesterday reminding me

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:34.800
 that deep venous thrombosis and other clotting problems are very easily usually resolved by a thyroid supplement.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.800
 When your thyroid is low, your clotting is up.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:43.800
 Hyperthyroid people have difficulty forming clots,

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:54.800
 but low thyroid people will have transient ischemic attacks and strokes and thrombosis of legs and lungs and whatnot.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.800
 So another reason to have that thyroid happy.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.800
 Yeah.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.800
 Yeah.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:06.800
 So other than the—I keep saying I'm going to leave, but there's so many people with the thyroid thing, it's like epidemic.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:13.800
 Other than the supplementation, before we leave thyroid,

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:20.800
 things we can do food-wise or lifestyle to boost the thyroid to get more back in balance.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.800
 Any ideas there?

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:33.800
 The PUFA are the main—polyunsaturated fats are the main things that interfere with thyroid production, transport, and response.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.800
 Okay.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:46.800
 But excess protein because of two or three amino acids, tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine are all the thyroid-suppressing amino acids.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:56.800
 So if you eat too much protein in relation to carbohydrate, that in itself is going to interfere with thyroid function.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.800
 Very interesting.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:03.800
 I've actually heard thyroid people that want to have you eat some animal protein in the morning to boost your thyroid.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.800
 Yeah, you need orange juice first to get your thyroid going.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.800
 Orange juice is better for your thyroid than animal protein?

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.800
 Oh, good.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.800
 And you don't have to kill a cow.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.800
 That's great.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.800
 Okay.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.800
 Let's move on here.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:24.800
 Here's a lady that really enjoyed the first show.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.800
 I hope Dr. Peat comes back.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:36.800
 I'm doing some liver, some eggs, some bone broth, zero PUFAs, sourdough bread, ripe fruits, and she's giving her whole kind of diet.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.800
 I feel much better, and my temperatures are higher.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.800
 I sleep better.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.800
 My question is this.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:48.800
 I've never had allergies or food intolerances, and none of these foods are new to me.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:56.800
 However, I get horrible, painful acne behind my ears and chin and below my ears even if I back off the liver.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:00.800
 Any idea I could find out what's causing this?

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:07.800
 When I first supplemented DHEA, I got acne.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:19.800
 And the thyroid, one of its most important functions is to increase your conversion of cholesterol to progesterone and DHEA.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:34.800
 And the surge of new youth-related hormones can give a 50-year-old person teenage acne if your nutrients aren't all in balance.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:45.800
 Some shellfish, some liver, fibrous foods, it takes a good balance of nutrients.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:59.800
 And too much protein relative to carbohydrate can dip your blood sugar and cause a stress reaction that activates the production of cortisol.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:12.800
 And if your thyroid is good, the adrenals will make a surge of DHEA, and that could make the skin oily and susceptible to acne.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.800
 So maybe she's just kind of getting a little younger.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:24.800
 Yeah, acne is a sign that the skin is rejuvenating its oil and moisture.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.800
 So she's doing good, right? She's just getting younger.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.800
 Yeah, it increases your nutrient requirement.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:42.800
 The thyroid stimulating the conversion of cholesterol to progesterone, for example, greatly increases the consumption of vitamin A.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:53.800
 And the vitamin A deficiency makes your immune system fail, can make bacteria able to grow in your skin.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:38:02.800
 And that's why the vitamin A is one of the whole reasons why the pro-cod liver fish oil people take this, right?

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.800
 Because they say you need the vitamin A for your eyes and everything.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:11.800
 Yeah, and it comes with vitamin D in fish oil.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:17.800
 Yeah, which you're not a fan of. That's like one of the worst poofers, right? The fish oil.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.800
 Yeah.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:25.800
 Have you ever seen people do well with cod liver or fish oil over a long period of time?

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.800
 Oh, sure. Yeah, young people do very well.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:36.800
 When the thyroid is up, it can consume, destroy, excrete the fish oil fats.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:48.800
 But when you're under stress, the fish oil then tends to accumulate, break down, and produce inflammation and immune suppressive products.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:55.800
 It oxidizes almost instantly into immune suppressors if your liver is a little slow.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:03.800
 So in a perfect world, if one wanted to do cod liver oil, you wouldn't get all yellow-fatted up or lipofuscin?

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.800
 No, for a young person.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.800
 For a young person, yeah.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.800
 Here's John. He's in Australia.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:23.800
 Could you ask Dr. Peat, if it's not too late, about the cell membrane and if it is not made of calcium and phospholipids to share what he believes?

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.800
 Does he believe the cell membrane is a polarized water?

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.800
 Wow, that's quite a question.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:42.800
 Actually, I think it should be referred to as the cell surface, an interface between two phases.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:53.800
 And every interface between ionically different substances will have an electric double layer.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:40:09.800
 No matter what the substances are, if you examine it on the electron microscope level, you'll see a polarization of whatever is there by this electric double layer.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:28.800
 Each substance has its own affinity for electrons. And when you put different substances together, they compete for the electrons and you get that microscopic reversal double layer electronic.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:46.800
 And that will polarize proteins or fats or ions, whatever is there, and create the microscopic appearance of a double layer bilayer, which if there's a lot of fat around, it'll be a lipid bilayer.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:53.800
 But that's a side effect, not an organ.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:41:05.800
 In the 1960s, disregarding the physics of the situation, there was a great movement to explain everything in terms of genes.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:17.800
 The genetic theory of cancer was imposed by the government in the 1960s and that came along with the membrane mania.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:25.800
 Biologists just went crazy in the 1960s creating new journals specializing in membranes.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:30.800
 By the early 1970s, that craze had died away.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:38.800
 People like Gilbert Ling and Harold Hillman showed that basically they were looking at artifacts.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:52.800
 You can make a picture of a membrane, but there's no barrier membrane. That's what they believed in and imposed in school, that there's an electronic barrier membrane.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:42:11.800
 Gilbert Ling long ago showed that with labeled isotopes, you can show that sodium moves in and out freely. There's absolutely no barrier to sodium, which was the whole philosophical basis for believing in a barrier membrane.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:18.800
 So what do we take away from this as far as learning about our health? It was a little geeky what you said. It was interesting.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:24.800
 But what could this information do for us taking care of our body?

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:43.800
 One of the selling points for fish oil was that PUFA are essential fatty acids and they're essential for making prostaglandins and for making membranes and our brains, they say, are 60% fish oil.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:54.800
 And so if you don't eat your essential PUFA, you won't have proper brains because the brains are so PUFA loaded.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:07.800
 But at birth, when you look at a newborn human or animal baby, their brains are defined as essential fatty acid deficient.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:18.800
 We have the mead acids in the newborn brain, which are the defining sign of a PUFA deficiency.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:29.800
 So if you want a newborn, fresh, energetic, able to learn brain, you don't want it loaded with fish oil.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:41.800
 That's something that accumulates all during adulthood and by the age of 50 is increasing the risk of nerve diseases.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.800
 The polyunsaturated fatty acids we call PUFAs, right?

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.800
 Which accumulate in the brain.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:44:02.800
 On the idea of electrons, we've been told that toxic substances steals, maybe, does it steal an electron or it's a negative electron thing and that causes the cells to oxidize? Is that close?

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:19.800
 That is one of the ideas. But behind that, if you cut off the oxygen supply, surprisingly, you get a surge of oxidative damage.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:33.800
 If you run an animal at high rate with thyroid or anything else that increases the mitochondrial oxygen consumption, their free radical production drops drastically.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:48.800
 There's a good paper called Uncoupled and Surviving in which they show that the faster the mitochondria run consuming oxygen, the less oxidative damage there is and the longer the animal lives.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:45:01.800
 The saturation index is another. The cancer-free animals and long-lived animals have a high saturation ratio to unsaturated fats.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:10.800
 So, how do we use that information to increase our lifespan and also that of our animals?

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.800
 Avoiding the PUFA.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.800
 Avoiding the PUFAs again, wow.

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:25.800
 Yeah, with farmed salmon, they found that they had better health, better endurance if they fed them some saturated fats rather than the fish oils.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:30.800
 So, even the cold water fish do better without their PUFA.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:36.800
 So, for the animals, we stick with the saturated fats just like for ourselves?

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.800
 Yeah.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:49.800
 Yeah, just like ourselves. So, does vitamin C and other things like kind of put this electron back on?

00:45:49.800 --> 00:46:14.800
 Yeah, ascorbic acid existing inside cells where it is active and protective is an oxidant. It's called dehydroascorbate and the dehydroascorbate to ascorbic acid ratio is at least 8 to 1 inside the cell, highly oxidizing.

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:24.800
 So, the so-called antioxidant, it does prevent oxidative damage, but it does it because it's pro-oxidative.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:36.800
 The things in fruits and vegetables that are considered antioxidants work because inside the cell, they are extremely pro-oxidative.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:53.800
 And if you imagine a cell which is suddenly suffocated and can't use its oxygen, electrons accumulate because they aren't being turned into water with the oxygen.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:47:14.800
 The electrons accumulate and any iron atom which had been in the inert F3 positive, it catches the electron and is turned into the F2 positive.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:31.800
 The reduced iron becomes a catalyst for destructive random oxidation. So, an excess of electrons is what creates destructive cell-killing oxidation by way of iron.

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:37.800
 Does regular ascorbic acid get into the cells to put that?

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:43.800
 Yeah, it's taken in and immediately oxidized to dehydroascorbate.

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.800
 And that's a good thing.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:55.800
 Yeah, and cancer cells, if you look at the ascorbic acid content, it is high relative to the dehydroascorbate.

00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:03.800
 It has become reduced and is no longer working because the cancer has an excess of electrons.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:09.800
 So, do you and do you recommend other people take daily doses of extra vitamin C?

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:15.800
 No, because milk and meat are very good sources.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:28.800
 I experimented stopping all the known sources such as fruits, vitamin C and ate mostly milk and meat and eggs.

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:42.800
 And several weeks later, I kept testing my urine vitamin C output and it was still up in around 3000 milligrams per day even though I was just eating milk and meat.

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.800
 Oh, so yeah, because you're a milk guy, right? Yeah, you're a milk guy.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:46.800
 Yeah.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.800
 Interesting.

00:48:47.800 --> 00:49:04.800
 Here's an, oh, yeah, do you have any knowledge or opinions of this very famous brand, this lipospheric vitamin C, if it works any better getting in the cells than the ascorbic acid?

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.800
 Is that the palmitate?

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.800
 Well, let's see.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.800
 I'm not sure if palmitate, it's lipospheric, live on labs.

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.800
 I'm not sure what's in there.

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:25.800
 Years ago, the sausage makers developed a palmitic extra vitamin C and that works for preserving fats.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:35.800
 So, it was good in industry and they started selling it as a supplement, but I don't think it's any better than real vitamin C.

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:39.800
 You don't think it does much of anything, it's just a marketing thing, you think?

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.800
 I think so.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.800
 Yeah, well, they do good at that, that marketing thing, boy.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.800
 Good at that.

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.800
 Dr. Peat, this is from Glenn.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.800
 He is, let's see where Glenn is, in Colorado.

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:56.800
 I know you're a big fan of cholesterol and keeping levels higher than is recommended by doctors.

00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:03.800
 My question is, is it safe to raise cholesterol levels by supplementing with dried cholesterol powder?

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.800
 And he's got another question and we'll do this one first.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:12.800
 There has been research with that, for example, in autism.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:20.800
 And I don't know what the source of their cholesterol was, but it did improve the autistic kids.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:34.800
 But years ago, someone analyzed the supposedly chemically pure cholesterol that was being used in experiments feeding animals.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:38.800
 And they found that it was pretty highly oxidized, making it toxic.

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:54.800
 So even at 1% oxidized cholesterol, I wouldn't risk taking a supplement unless you knew that it was very close to absolute unoxidized.

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.800
 So the liver makes most of the cholesterol, is that correct?

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:05.800
 Yeah, and when you eat more cholesterol, you shut off your own liver's production to a great extent.

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:14.800
 So by eating a bunch of cholesterol, like eggs or, I don't know, meat, it doesn't really raise that number that we like to keep up there?

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:26.800
 No, 40 years ago, someone tested patients and healthy people and found that very sick people, you could raise their cholesterol with eggs.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:34.800
 But healthy people, at 22 eggs a day, they still hadn't raised their serum cholesterol.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:42.800
 So we know with a lot of studies, a recent one of Sweden, that especially folks 60, 70, 80, up there,

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:50.800
 they have a much better mortality rate with higher levels, you know, high levels up there, 225.

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.800
 And avoiding dementia is very important.

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:59.800
 And avoiding dementia. So how do people keep that number up there if the food doesn't do it? I'm kind of confused.

00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:09.800
 The thyroid and sugar are very important, keeping inflammation down in the intestine.

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:19.800
 Eating raw vegetables feeds bacteria, and the bacteria create endotoxin, which poisons the intestine and liver,

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:24.800
 so keeping it from making adequate cholesterol.

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:34.800
 So a diet rich in non-irritating, easily absorbed foods, milk and orange juice,

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:41.800
 are the simplest for keeping the energy of the liver up and the inflammation down.

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:46.800
 So the raw foods, you're a fan of cooking your vegetables?

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:50.800
 Yeah, overcooking, actually.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.800
 Overcooking, yeah.

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:58.800
 Yeah, the reason raw vegetables lower your cholesterol way down to half of what it should be or less,

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:04.800
 is that they're feeding bacteria, which are poisoning your liver, so it can't make the normal amount.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:11.800
 That's interesting. Feeding bacteria that's causing your liver not to make the cholesterol.

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:18.800
 But I mean, all the raw food people, they talk about how the raw vegetables, they're feeding with good enzymes,

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:22.800
 and this is what we need as living human beings.

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:29.800
 Yeah, but the liver left alone and giving nourishment knows how much cholesterol to make

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:34.800
 and how much to turn into bile salts and hormones and so on.

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:44.800
 So supporting the liver, it'll do the right thing, which is to keep your cholesterol in the range of 160 to 200.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.800
 At least. And how do we support our liver just in general?

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:52.800
 Yeah, avoiding raw vegetables is very important.

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.800
 Very important.

00:53:54.800 --> 00:54:02.800
 Getting adequate calcium, sugar, sodium, all of the essential nutrients.

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:09.800
 All of the nutrients. Sugar in the form of fruits, right? Apples and oranges.

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:19.800
 Yeah, one of the anti-sugar guys, Yudkin, I think, wrote a book explaining that it wasn't saturated fat.

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:27.800
 It was sugar that raised your cholesterol, and that created the anti-sugar craze that it would cause heart disease.

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:33.800
 But raising your cholesterol, your liver's ability to make it, is just what we need.

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:41.800
 And what causes the cholesterol to rise up to 300 milligrams per cent, for example,

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:48.800
 is blocking the thyroid function because the thyroid function is using that protective cholesterol

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:52.800
 to make progesterone, DHEA, testosterone, and so on.

00:54:52.800 --> 00:55:00.800
 Back to the power and the critical nature of this organ, the thyroid.

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:07.800
 Don't you find it curious that there's literally an epidemic of thyroid dysfunction in our culture?

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:13.800
 Just in Broderbarn's time, before Synthroid came on the market,

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:20.800
 he was showing that about a third of the population benefited greatly

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:26.800
 and would avoid premature heart disease and cancer in his career.

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:30.800
 None of his patients died of heart attacks.

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.800
 By doing what?

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.800
 By supplementing thyroid.

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.800
 Did he use a desiccated at that time?

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:40.800
 Yeah, Armour was the only thing he ever used.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.800
 Which has a T4/T3, correct?

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:51.800
 Yeah, it was the standardized pork and beef thyroid,

00:55:51.800 --> 00:56:00.800
 standardized to have approximately a 3.5 to 1 ratio of T4 to T3.

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:05.800
 A listener wants to know the names of the brands that I might get

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:10.800
 if I wanted to move to a synthetic thyroid, as Dr. Peat recommends.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.800
 What are those names?

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.800
 Thyrol-R was the standard for about 50 years.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.800
 I don't know if they're even making it now.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:24.800
 CINO+ from Mexico is the one that I've been using for 30 years.

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:27.800
 CINO+, oh, that's from that Mexican pharmacy.

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.800
 You can get CINO+.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.800
 Mm-hmm.

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:31.800
 Yeah, uh-huh.

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.800
 And you've been using that for 30 years?

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:34.800
 Mm-hmm.

00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:40.800
 When the thyroid production went from the Armour company

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:45.800
 to Revlon, the cosmetics company, I stopped using it.

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.800
 And when was that?

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:50.800
 Around 1991 or '92, I think.

00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.800
 My goodness, my goodness.

00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.800
 Dr. Peat, stay right there, okay?

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.800
 I'm really having fun.

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:59.800
 Boy, we have lots of action going on, lots of emails, telephone calls.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:01.800
 We're going to do what we can here to take care of you.

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.800
 It's really fun having Dr. Ray Peat on,

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.800
 patricktimpone@oneradionetwork.com.

00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:11.800
 Dr. Peat's website is rayPeat.com.

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:12.800
 You can also sign up.

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:17.800
 He's got a very interesting newsletter, and it's very affordable.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:18.800
 He can tell you how much.

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:19.800
 It's practically nothing.

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:21.800
 And get that newsletter and stay up to date.

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.800
 Incredible amount of articles on his website.

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:27.800
 And as you can tell, he's well-researched

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:37.800
 and sounds pretty credible to me, rayPeat.com.

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:45.800
 Dr. Peat's a fan of milk, and we're kind of a fan of colostrum.

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:49.800
 I know that Dr. Thomas Cowan, a heart is not a pump guy,

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:53.800
 he's a big colostrum fan, and he says that it can help to heal

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:57.800
 and seal up the gut lining.

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:01.800
 And other people have said that, including Daniel Baitalos.

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:03.800
 Sir Thrivell makes a great colostrum.

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:08.800
 If you'd like to try some colostrum, it's the real deal.

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.800
 You open that little puppy up, and it smells--

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.800
 I can remember the first time I opened it up,

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.800
 and being an Italian Catholic, we had a lot of kids in my family,

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:20.800
 six brothers and sisters, seven total.

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.800
 Yeah, I did the math, six and one, it was seven.

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.800
 And I remember the first time I opened the colostrum up years ago,

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:32.800
 it actually had that smell, that little flame, that smell of breast milk.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.800
 And believe me, I smelled a lot of breast milk around my house

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.800
 because I was the only one who changed diapers

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:42.800
 and held the baby and stuff, more than all my brothers and sisters.

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:44.800
 I don't know what that was about.

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.800
 But anyway, it's a nice product.

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.800
 Click on it, front page, One Radio Network,

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.800
 and get yourself some colostrum if you'd like,

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:53.800
 from Daniel Vitalis, Sir Thrivell.

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.800
 Previously, with Wayne Blakely, we were talking about

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.800
 the Living Streams probiotics.

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:01.800
 That's why when we do your bifido in the mouth,

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:04.800
 we do it for the yttrium because the actual bifido doesn't--

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.800
 Right, that's a bifido 2 product I have.

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:10.800
 You put it in your ear, it bypasses the gastrointestinal tract,

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.800
 and it goes through the lymph system, the drain system,

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.800
 goes right into the small intestinal tract.

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:16.800
 It bypasses the gastrointestinal tract.

00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:17.800
 That's the reason I developed it.

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:21.800
 Now, for 50 years, they've been developing a probiotic capsule

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.800
 that you could take that'll open up in that area

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:24.800
 so the bacteria start growing.

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.800
 There's two problems with that.

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:27.800
 Number one, it doesn't work.

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.800
 And number two, they put a pathetic bifidos in there.

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.800
 They're weak, and they're dying anyway.

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.800
 What do you mean it doesn't work, number one?

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:35.800
 That's a bad way to say it.

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:36.800
 It doesn't work.

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:38.800
 It doesn't work. That capsule doesn't work.

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.800
 So that's the reason I developed a liquid product to bypass the gut.

00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:45.800
 Well, why doesn't the low pH just kill the liquid guys, too?

00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:49.800
 Because we put it in the ear, bypasses the gastrointestinal tract.

00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.800
 Oh, okay, that's the bifido, too.

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:52.800
 That's the bifido, too.

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:55.800
 You can use any of my products, do the same thing.

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.800
 They'll go right through, bypass the upper tract,

00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.800
 and go right into the lower tract.

00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.800
 That's where your immune system kicks in down there.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.800
 So we could use any of the living streams in our ear?

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.800
 Any of them.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.800
 It's all safe.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.800
 How are we doing?

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.800
 Totally safe.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.800
 Cool.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.800
 That is pretty cool.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.800
 That's where a good portion of the immune system is,

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.800
 in the small intestines.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.800
 Check them out in our store, Living Streams Products,

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.800
 all of them on OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.800
 Previously with Andrew Goss, I asked him

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:26.800
 why would someone want to buy coins from his company.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.800
 So if you don't know coins, you better know your coin dealer.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.800
 And you know, you shouldn't buy coins from someone

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.800
 who isn't a well-known registered dealer.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.800
 So if they're an NGC dealer, they're registered with NGC.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.800
 If they're a PCGS dealer, they're registered with PCGS.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:44.800
 Ask questions.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.800
 Don't just, "Oh yeah, here's 10 grand or 50 grand or 150 grand.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.800
 I just want to buy coins.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:51.800
 Let me know what I'm getting."

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.800
 No, that's not how an intelligent investor does it.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.800
 And we do not let you do that.

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:01.800
 So if you're not willing to learn about the coins that you're buying,

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.800
 maybe you should find another coin firm.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:04.800
 Don't call this one.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.800
 Because we're going to insist that you know why and how a coin is rare.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.800
 And once you know that, then I think you can take that knowledge

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.800
 into the marketplace and make intelligent investment decisions.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.800
 Aha, what a concept.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.800
 Intelligent investment decisions.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.800
 I've known Andrew for 25 years.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.800
 He's the real deal.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:28.800
 His company, SDL 800-468-2646.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.800
 Give him a call if you're interested.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.800
 800-468-2646.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.800
 Well, I don't know what's going on.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:40.800
 We're going to do a special remix archive show of Andrew Goss tomorrow,

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:44.800
 which is what we've been doing since Andrew passed on.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.800
 He went on his cosmic vacation, I guess, about a month ago.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.800
 God love him.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.800
 We really miss him.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.800
 So we're going to have a special show for you tomorrow.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.800
 So come by.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:58.800
 We're going to go over some of the things that are moving in the markets as well

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.800
 from all the places that we've done research.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.800
 I don't know what's going on, but I'll try to figure it out.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.800
 Gold is up $10 this morning.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.800
 Silver is up $0.15.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.800
 The dollar is down.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.800
 The stock market is up a little bit.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.800
 So we'll visit with Andrew Goss and have a special remix archive show.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.800
 People are enjoying them because I put together two or three shows,

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.800
 so it's really jammed with--it's always fun.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.800
 I've been listening to some of these old shows.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.800
 What a wealth of information he is.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:30.800
 By the way, with Andrew Goss, we have 11 years of shows in our archives,

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:35.800
 so you can get yourself a real PhD in economics by listening to this

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.800
 because he really fills you in.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.800
 That will be tomorrow, the Real World of Money Special Archives with Andrew Goss.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.800
 Speaking of PhD, Dr. Ray Peat has been around a while doing that.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.800
 Dr. Peat, you do a newsletter?

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.800
 Tell folks about that, how they can get that.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.800
 It's sent out every other month.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:04.800
 So 12 issues or two years, the email subscription is $28.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.800
 Oh, $28.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:06.800
 Even I can afford that.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:07.800
 I'm a talk show host.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.800
 Good for you.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:14.800
 That's a great--so every other month for $28 for two years at rayPeat.com.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.800
 I see.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.800
 Okay.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.800
 Boy, we can't get away from thyroid, but these are the questions.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:25.800
 Is it possible to become thyroid toxic from T4, T3 supplementation,

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:31.800
 i.e., can the body store too much T4 and cause problems?

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:40.800
 If it stores too much T4, generally that interferes with the conversion to T3.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:51.800
 So the real problem with taking too much T4 is the risk of turning off your brain metabolism.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:04:01.800
 If you take the combination, taking it too big a dose too fast can make you short of breath,

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:05.800
 can give you a fast heartbeat.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:15.800
 I think it was 1933, the JAMA magazine published a story about a doctor who had heard about

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:21.800
 Berta Barnes and preventing heart attacks with thyroid supplements.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:28.800
 He had a patient who had just recently had a heart attack, and this doctor hadn't read

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:36.800
 really what Berta Barnes was doing, so he gave him a full-size dose of thyroid, increasing

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:45.800
 his metabolic rate with his heart in a failing injured state, and the guy died almost immediately.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:50.800
 So that went out as a warning not to use thyroid.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.800
 It would kill you with a heart attack.

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.800
 I see.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:05:01.800
 In fact, when it's used properly, it's the best single way to prevent heart attacks.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:12.800
 But for example, a 40-year-old woman who had a fairly large fibroid blocking her fallopian

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:16.800
 tubes, and she wanted to get pregnant.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:24.800
 I explained how estrogen excess drives the growth of those tumors, and thyroid excess

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.800
 will give you an estrogen deficiency.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:36.800
 So she took Armour thyroid several grains a day, gradually worked up so that her resting

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.800
 heart rate was 110.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:47.800
 Her doctor said she was going to die from having a chronic 110 heart rate.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:55.800
 And then each month, the tumor shrank, and after four or five months, it had become small

01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:00.800
 enough that she became pregnant at a perfect pregnancy.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:05.800
 But that was a deliberate overdose.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:16.800
 Women who are having menorrhagia, hemorrhaging from prolonged excessive menstrual bleeding,

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:23.800
 that generally is hypothyroid, and they can temporarily increase their thyroid, not only

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:31.800
 to the point of normalizing menstruation, they can, within a few days of using an excess

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:39.800
 of T3, they can create an estrogen deficiency and turn off menstruation altogether.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:48.800
 So it can be dangerous if you take too much too fast, but it's a matter of watching for

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.800
 signs, increasing it in very small intervals.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:53.800
 Little by little.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.800
 That's Gina's question.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.800
 She's in San Diego.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:03.800
 I purchased some of the T3 from the website I got off your website, Patrick, in Mexico.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:09.800
 How long would Dr. Peat expect that I would have to take the T3 at these small doses throughout

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.800
 the day to raise my body temperature?

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:17.800
 It's currently about 97, almost all the time.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:24.800
 It varies with body weight and age and what you ate previously.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:36.800
 But if you have a sign such as elevated liver enzymes showing a sluggish liver, the small

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:42.800
 doses, one microgram at a time, within a few days, you can usually see normalization of

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.800
 the liver function.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:55.800
 But if you carefully watch your waking temperature and pulse rate, since the T3 acts within seconds

01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:05.800
 when it's absorbed, it's instant acting and acts as a catalyst to increase oxygen consumption.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:11.800
 That's the main virtue of T3, that with these very tiny doses, you can see exactly what

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:15.800
 you're doing, so you can avoid overdosing.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:25.800
 If they start with T4 and hope to get their temperature up, they see no results in the

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:31.800
 first three or four days, but meanwhile, it's accumulating in the body, taking a certain

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:32.800
 dose every day.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.800
 It builds up in your body for at least two weeks.

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:44.800
 So if you load up because you see no results in three or four days, then it turns out when

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:51.800
 you do get up to the normal temperature, you're going to overshoot it and you'll be, not happily,

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.800
 stressingly hyperthyroid for a couple of weeks.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.800
 It levels out.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:01.800
 So are folks generally starting really low, maybe 30 milligrams on the T4, the desiccated,

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:02.800
 and working up?

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.800
 That was Broda Barnes, a typical starting dose.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:14.800
 I've seen two people over the last 40 years for whom that was too much, their heart raced

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:21.800
 and they had to go back to even 15 micrograms for these oversensitive people can make their

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.800
 heart hurt or go too fast.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:29.800
 They have to supplement both sugar and magnesium.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:38.800
 The thyroid lets your cells retain magnesium and potassium, and so eating well and maybe

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:46.800
 supplementing magnesium helps you adjust to the thyroid because your muscles will take

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:53.800
 away the necessary magnesium and cause your heart vessels to constrict and cause heart

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:54.800
 pain.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.800
 I hope you don't.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:00.800
 So folks taking the T3 little by little, even one or two micrograms an hour, should they

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.800
 see their pulse rate move up a little bit?

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.800
 Yeah.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:06.800
 Or not?

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.800
 Yeah.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:08.800
 Very, very slightly.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.800
 One or two beats per day is fine.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.800
 One or two beats per day, did you say?

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.800
 Yeah.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.800
 Or per minute per day?

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.800
 Per minute per day.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.800
 Would they use that as a gauge if they're taking too much and not enough or just the

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.800
 temperature or both?

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:32.800
 If you get up to the ideal pulse rate and temperature in four or five hours, then even

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:42.800
 with T3, you're going to overshoot because it has a 12 to 24 hour accumulating half-life.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.800
 So you don't want to get there the first day.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:50.800
 Even with T3, it's best to work up gradually.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:51.800
 Go real slow.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.800
 So what happens if you would be on T3 and things are going good, your temperature's

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.800
 up, your pulse is up a little bit, and then you would just stop?

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.800
 Then what would happen?

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:04.800
 You got the hypothyroid like I did when I was taking it.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.800
 It would just go back?

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.800
 Yeah.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:16.800
 When I suppressed my thyroid so that I had these depressions in my throat, I stopped

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:22.800
 it entirely, and the next morning my throat was smooth again.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:28.800
 Several people who have overdosed on thyroid to the point of having a collapsed appearance

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:33.800
 of their throat, just in one day, it pops right back.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.800
 So is there any danger of being on T3 for a couple months and then quitting and seeing

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:42.800
 if it's going to help you just work without it?

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:47.800
 Yeah, usually two or three weeks you'll see whether it's correcting your own thyroid.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.800
 Oh, so you could get off it and see if it's going to hold?

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:51.800
 Yeah.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.800
 Oh, that's interesting.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:57.800
 Here's an email from, I'm not sure, Amy.

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:04.800
 Does Dr. Peate have any opinion about using pure pine gum spirits of turpentine?

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.800
 Oh, yeah.

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:14.800
 I always use turpentine as my painting medium.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:22.800
 Some people are allergic to it, but I always felt that it was safe and beneficial to have

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.800
 some of the fumes around.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:34.800
 It was very common to use it for a poultice in an inflammatory condition, even to take

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.800
 a drop of it on a sugar cube, for example.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:45.800
 I think that traditionally it seemed to have some benefits.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:51.800
 I think that the risk of allergy is present, but usually exaggerated.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:58.800
 Here's a lady that says, "I've never really had a menstrual cycle and began in ninth grade.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:02.800
 I've also despised, upset me."

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:07.800
 Well, Barry, I simply decided in my mind not to ever have one.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:13.800
 Not sure if this was part of it, but maybe a dozen times I've even had, and I'm 56,

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:17.800
 I have bloated belly and probably some hormone problems.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.800
 What do you think about this?

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:24.800
 So she just decided she didn't want to have a period, and she stopped having them, I guess.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:31.800
 Yeah, the cycles are governed by the brain, which governs the pituitary, which stimulates

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:32.800
 the ovaries.

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:40.800
 And so, attitude, stress is the main thing that turns off the cycles.

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:50.800
 It isn't good for an overstressed or undernourished person to get pregnant, and so the body regulates

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:56.800
 to avoid pregnancy when your brain doesn't want it.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.800
 Do you think when women go through menopause and they stop menstruating, that's one of

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:04.800
 the reasons why they generally live longer than us guys?

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:17.800
 Yeah, the iron absorption really begins at menopause because what fails and stops the

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.800
 period is the production of progesterone primarily.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:32.800
 And the myth that menopause is a deficiency of estrogen is purely a medical birth control

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.800
 industry fabrication.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:42.800
 What happens is a failure of progesterone around the age of 45 or 50 or 55, and all

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:50.800
 of the tissues of the body make estrogen, and in the absence of progesterone, they make

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.800
 more estrogen.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:15:04.800
 And the progesterone is needed to cause the cells to release estrogen and excrete it.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:12.800
 So when you don't have progesterone, you necessarily are going to have intracellular estrogen excess.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:19.800
 Any stress will increase your estrogen production, but it won't necessarily show up in the bloodstream

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:27.800
 unless you have the progesterone, which knocks out the enzymes that retain it in cells.

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:32.800
 And intracellular estrogen is active.

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:39.800
 For example, in a breast cancer, there is a huge amount of estrogen being produced in

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:40.800
 the tumor.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.800
 In uterine cancer, the same thing.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.800
 The uterus becomes the source of the estrogen.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:55.800
 In the 40s and 50s, they were taking out women's ovaries and pituitaries to treat breast cancer,

01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:00.800
 not knowing that the estrogen isn't coming primarily from the ovaries.

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:08.800
 In experiments with monkeys, someone actually measured the amount of estrogen coming out

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:15.800
 minute by minute from the ovaries, and to control, they measured the estrogen coming

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:22.800
 out of the arm vein, and they found that the arm was producing just as much estrogen as

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:23.800
 the ovaries.

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:30.800
 So a hysterectomy takes away your progesterone, but it leaves your arms and legs and all of

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:40.800
 your organs making estrogen, and so you're estrogen exposed beginning at menopause.

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:48.800
 And estrogen causes iron retention, and so in old age, women tend to catch up with men

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:53.800
 in the iron overload symptoms such as heart disease.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:54.800
 Very interesting.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:57.800
 Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone, raypeat.com.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:02.800
 Stanley wants to know if bone broth is as healthy as it claims to be.

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:10.800
 Not if it's made with marrow bones because of the fat and iron in the marrow, very high

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.800
 concentration of iron which interacts with the fat.

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:20.800
 So the healthy broth is made from the joints.

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.800
 The joint bones, yeah.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:33.800
 Lots of cartilage and tendons, ligaments, and all of the connective tissues that are

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:34.800
 rich in gelatin.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.800
 But not the marrow bones.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:37.800
 That's interesting.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:42.800
 I give my dog some marrow bones, grass-fed, and boy, she'll work and work and work to

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:44.800
 get all that marrow out of there.

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.800
 She's usually generally pretty smart about what she eats.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.800
 Do you think she knows that she needs that or?

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:54.800
 It's very tasty and nourishing in the short run.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:00.800
 But if you do it over the years, you accumulate too much iron and broken down fat.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:01.800
 Okay.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:02.800
 Here's a telephone call.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.800
 On the phone, who's this, please?

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:05.800
 Hi, I'm Patrick.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.800
 This is Mike in Chattanooga.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.800
 Mike, you're on the air with Ray Peat.

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:10.800
 Go ahead.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:11.800
 Yeah, Dr. Peat.

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:16.800
 My digestive tract is a real train wreck and it has a lot of inflammation.

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:21.800
 I've seen a chiropractor and he took an x-ray of my gut and he said he'd never seen that

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.800
 much inflammation in a man's gut.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.800
 And so I'm real sensitive to foods and stuff.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:32.800
 And when I juice beets, it really helps lower my blood pressure.

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.800
 As a result of this train wreck digestive tract, my blood pressure wants to jump up

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.800
 a lot of times.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.800
 If I eat certain things, it will irritate it.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.800
 You know, like something that's really fibrous.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:48.800
 And so I have to really watch what I eat.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:53.800
 Do you know anything that can help reduce the inflammation in a gut when it's really

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.800
 off the deep end like that, you know?

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:07.800
 The main thing is to reduce the fermentable grains, nuts, vegetables, starches, and use

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:14.800
 the foods that are easily, quickly digested and absorbed.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:22.800
 Milk, meat, eggs, and sweet fruits such as oranges are quickly digested and so they don't

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.800
 support so much bacterial growth.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:31.800
 And there are some fibrous foods that are also antiseptic.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:40.800
 Cooked bamboo shoots, cooked, well-cooked mushrooms, and raw carrots are antiseptic,

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:47.800
 antibiotic producers as well as being good fiber.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:54.800
 Right, and I juice a lot of carrots and beets together and that nitric oxide will lower

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:55.800
 my blood pressure.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:59.800
 If I don't do that, then my blood pressure will be too high.

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:09.800
 But the carrot juice is very rich in carotene and so if you do that chronically, it's going

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:15.800
 to accumulate in your tissues, make your palms turn orange, and suppress your thyroid and

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:16.800
 testosterone.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.800
 Oh, that's not good.

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:23.800
 Right, and that was where I was going next is because if I eat broccoli and cauliflower,

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:28.800
 you know, even if it's cooked, all of a sudden I'll break into this freezing, you know what

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.800
 I mean?

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.800
 I'm that cold.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:35.800
 I mean, it's just like I am freezing when I eat those vegetables because they shut down

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.800
 the thyroid activity, don't they, temporarily.

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.800
 That's true.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:42.800
 Okay, Mike.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:47.800
 I repeat saying this like maybe 10 years ago and I've been watching it.

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:48.800
 I have to be real careful.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:55.800
 I try to eat broccoli and cauliflower occasionally, but I have to really not eat much of it because

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.800
 it will make you just freezing cold.

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:06.800
 I use that Edgar Cayce iodine, the good kind, Patrick, that you have, and that will help

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.800
 warm me back up.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:14.800
 Yeah, but Ray P, you said that the iodine really doesn't affect the thyroid like we

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:15.800
 have been told.

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.800
 Is that correct?

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:25.800
 Usually, people eating foods from various regions will have at least as much iodine

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:32.800
 already, and if they use iodized salt, around the world there have been surveys that showed

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:41.800
 that people who add iodized salt to an already good diet have an increased incidence of thyroid

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:51.800
 inflammation, thyroid gland inflammation, and thyroid cancer because, for example, a

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:57.800
 cow won't produce milk, a chicken won't produce eggs if they're seriously iodine

01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:58.800
 deficient.

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.800
 So, eggs and milk are guaranteed good sources of iodine.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.800
 Okay, thanks for the call, Mike.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:05.800
 We appreciate it.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:11.800
 On a past show, this is Max's in Switzerland, Dr. Peat mentioned that Hashimoto's is

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:16.800
 not really an autoimmune condition caused by the immune system attacking its own thyroid

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.800
 tissue.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:24.800
 Could he elaborate on the mechanisms and reasons why the body starts producing these antibodies

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.800
 against the thyroid?

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:37.800
 There were experiments years ago in which a piece of cow's cartilage was implanted

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:47.800
 and the immune system recognized it as normal cow material, but then they twisted it, just

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:57.800
 mechanically gave it a sharp twist and implanted that, and the cow's antibodies recognized

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:04.800
 it as foreign material and began phagocytizing it, breaking it down.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:16.800
 And the immune system recognizes damage to your own tissue and goes in to remove damaged

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:20.800
 tissue as part of a normal cleanup process.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:29.800
 In the last 25 years, there have been two people showing the fallacy of the usual idea

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:38.800
 of how the immune system works that derived from Paul Ehrlich, and they showed that Mechnikov,

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:41.800
 he shared the Nobel Prize with Ehrlich.

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:48.800
 Mechnikov was an embryologist who had a very different idea that the immune system helped

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:52.800
 maintain healthy structure of the organism.

01:23:52.800 --> 01:24:01.800
 And these two recent theorists, Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Matsinger, have what they call the

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:09.800
 danger or damage theory of the immune system, that the immune system, if you have an infection,

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:18.800
 the damaged human tissue is what the immune system recognizes and goes in and as a byproduct

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:26.800
 of correcting our own healthy structure, removing the damage, they take out the cause of the

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.800
 damage just as a side effect.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:36.800
 But if you damage a joint just by twisting it, your immune system recognizes it and goes

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:39.800
 in, invades it with white blood cells.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:47.800
 If you damage your thyroid gland by taking too much iodine or too much PUFA that blocks

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:55.800
 its function, that is an intrinsic structural damage of our tissue that the immune system

01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:01.800
 recognizes as danger and damage and goes in to clean it up.

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.800
 Same in the brain.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:11.800
 They've demonstrated that if you block the white blood cells and antibody production

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:19.800
 that are involved in encephalitis, that the encephalitis kills the organism faster for

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.800
 blocking the immune reaction.

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:28.800
 So the immune system is doing what it's supposed to do in this classic autoimmune situation?

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:39.800
 Somewhere it's limited and failing to finish cleaning up the job because usually it's an

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:48.800
 excess of estrogen interfering with the stabilizing hormones, DHEA and progesterone and pregnenolone,

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:55.800
 which stabilize the whole structure of the cell so that the body recognizes it as good

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.800
 immune material rather than random damaged material.

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:06.800
 So it's a matter of re-energizing the cell that will stop the autoimmune process.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:07.800
 Re-energizing.

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.800
 Here's a question for you.

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:14.800
 Medical medium Anthony Williams, I've heard of him, claims that Hashimoto's immune response

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:20.800
 is really a body attacking a chronic Epstein-Barr virus hiding in the thyroid.

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:23.800
 What does Dr. Peat think of this theory?

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:32.800
 That is probably valid as one of the causes of the tissue damage, but the Epstein-Barr

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:39.800
 goes wild in a hypothyroid person because of the low energy.

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:46.800
 We activate things like herpes virus and Epstein-Barr when our cell energy is low.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:50.800
 So it may be accurate, but there's a whole lot of other things going on, what you're

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:51.800
 saying?

01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:54.800
 The most general thing is failure of energy.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:57.800
 Failure of energy.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:03.800
 Thyroid up energy and PUFA energy down.

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:04.800
 PUFA down.

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:11.800
 I consume 325 milligrams of aspirin, writes Mark, right before bed, 625 milligrams upon

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.800
 waking for joint pain.

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:14.800
 It helps a lot.

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:17.800
 How much vitamin K would you suggest I use?

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.800
 Do I need it daily or weekly?

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:28.800
 One milligram a day is adequate to keep your liver making the clotting agents.

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:34.800
 And one of the things the aspirin is doing is activating the thyroid function, activating

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.800
 mitochondrial oxidation.

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.800
 It revs up your thyroid function.

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:46.800
 So aspirin, like he's using it, is a sensible approach?

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.800
 I think so.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.800
 So aspirin is relatively safe?

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:58.800
 Yeah, you just, in the long run, you can suppress your immune, your clotting system.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:08.800
 And so the thyroid, I did that myself using a combination of penicillin and aspirin.

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:16.800
 I was going along feeling very good, but I wasn't eating vegetables or liver and I became

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.800
 vitamin K deficient.

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:23.800
 And the tiniest little scratch, I would drip blood for several minutes.

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:30.800
 And I realized that I had to eat liver or take vitamin K if I was going to use a combination

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:38.800
 of penicillin and aspirin because penicillin stops the vitamin K production in the intestine.

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:39.800
 Interesting.

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:44.800
 George writes in, "People with kidney disease and ammonia overload are being told to avoid

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:47.800
 potatoes because of excess potassium.

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:52.800
 Is there anything to this or is it just mainstream medical mythology?"

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:53.800
 The latter.

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:55.800
 Medical mythology.

01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.800
 Sure.

01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.800
 A lot of that going on, right?

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:05.800
 Gosh, it's tough to keep up with this.

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:09.800
 Well, hold on a second.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:13.800
 A lot of thyroid questions here.

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:20.800
 My wife, a woman 62, had a total hysterectomy, all female ovaries removed.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.800
 Can she live well without estrogen?

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:26.800
 She takes bioestrogen, progesterone, and thyroid.

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:32.800
 I know Ray is kind of anti-estrogen.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.800
 Partly depends on weight.

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:43.800
 A skinny little person is fairly safe for not producing too much estrogen, but the plumper

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:56.800
 you are, the more risk you have of accumulating dangerous amounts of estrogen.

01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:06.800
 I know an endocrinologist who was giving his wife monthly progesterone, and in her 60s,

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:11.800
 she looked very young, and he said she was still menstruating because he kept giving

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:19.800
 her the monthly progesterone, but her skin looked like a 30-year-old because of the protective

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.800
 effect of progesterone.

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:31.800
 What could cause hot flashes to start up again after 10 years of not having any?

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:40.800
 Oh, hot flashes have been taking nature thyroid for several years.

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:48.800
 Various things can increase your estrogen and nitric oxide production, a change of flora

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.800
 in the intestine.

01:30:50.800 --> 01:31:00.800
 That's one of the benefits of a high-fiber diet, but the natural antibiotics, some of

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:11.800
 the bacteriophage viruses that kill bacteria, and a few of the antiseptic bacteria, bacillus

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:21.800
 subtilis, for example, can normalize or improve the intestinal flora so that we aren't producing

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:24.800
 huge amounts of nitric oxide.

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:34.800
 Estrogen, serotonin, and nitric oxide are involved in the vascular changes that produce

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:35.800
 the hot flashes.

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:41.800
 Here's an emailer that has hypertrophic cardiopathy, heart muscle thickened on the

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:42.800
 left ventricle.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:47.800
 My symptoms are mild palpitations, a little bit of lightheadedness sometimes.

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:50.800
 Cardiologist doesn't have much to do to help me.

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:53.800
 Does Dr. Peate have any insights on this?

01:31:53.800 --> 01:32:01.800
 Yeah, I have a couple of newsletters a few years ago on the heart and progesterone and

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.800
 estrogen's effect.

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:10.800
 Animal studies, traditionally, they've blamed heart enlargement on the thyroid because if

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:18.800
 you take gigantic doses of thyroid, keep your heart going 125 per minute, that will enlarge

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.800
 your heart because it works harder.

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:29.800
 But when they did this in rats and then gave them only a physiological supportive amount

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:36.800
 of T3, the fibrosis of the heart was actually reversed.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:48.800
 The fibrosis is a product of not enough oxygen, too much nitric oxide and estrogen and stress.

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:57.800
 And by reducing the stress, keeping the oxygen and carbon dioxide up, lactic acid down, if

01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:04.800
 you had your blood tested, you would probably see higher than average lactic acid as a result

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:07.800
 of low thyroid function.

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:13.800
 Lewis writes in, "My resting pulse rate is about 65 and if I get up to 70, I feel kind

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:17.800
 of anxious and unsettled, much like Patrick has talked about.

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:18.800
 I'm in the same way.

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.800
 I'm 60 all the time, boom, boom, boom.

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:24.800
 And if I get to about 65, I can kind of feel it."

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:27.800
 So what do you suppose is going on for Lewis and I?

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:30.800
 I mean, we should be just okay with 60, right?

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:35.800
 I mean, do you think that there could be some improvement for us with low pulses?

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:37.800
 Oh, yeah.

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:39.800
 Temperature is very important.

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:44.800
 Some people can get their temperature up and still have a slow pulse.

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:53.800
 But the central thing to think about is having around a 98.6 temperature during most of the

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:54.800
 day.

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:58.800
 And that's the key and then whatever your pulse wants to be to get it there, then that's

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.800
 fine, is what you're saying?

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:01.800
 Yeah.

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:07.800
 If you have a very big heart, it can do enough circulation with fewer beats.

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:08.800
 Oh, I see.

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:09.800
 Of course.

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:11.800
 If you have a small heart, it has to beat faster.

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:19.800
 But on average, I think people feel best with an 85 per minute resting pulse.

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:20.800
 Really?

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:21.800
 Wow.

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:23.800
 That seems like supercharge to me on a bullet train.

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:24.800
 I can't imagine that.

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:25.800
 But who knows?

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:26.800
 That's really interesting.

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:32.800
 Does Dr. Peat recommend supplementation with B12 to either meat eaters and non-meat eaters?

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.800
 And if yes, what type of cabalimine B12 does he recommend?

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:42.800
 I generally don't recommend it because we can make it in our intestine.

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:50.800
 And in the last few years, I've seen many people with twice the normal amount of B12.

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:57.800
 And it turns out that they have overgrowth of bacteria in their intestine.

01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:04.800
 The B12 isn't hurting them, but when it's so high without a supplement, that means that

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.800
 their bacteria are going wild.

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:10.800
 Oh, that's the bacteria in the small intestine, the classic SIBO thing we hear about?

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:11.800
 Yeah.

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:12.800
 Yeah.

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:13.800
 And that is caused by?

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:14.800
 Slow digestion.

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:15.800
 Slow digestion.

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:26.800
 When your thyroid is good, you should make exuberant amounts of stomach acid and quickly

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:34.800
 get the digestion going and then squirt out lots of enzymes from the pancreas.

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.800
 The germs just can't survive in that environment.

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:42.800
 The small intestine should be absolutely sterile all the way down to the colon.

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:47.800
 Emily gets loose stool, she says, when she takes even just a little bit of the T3.

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:49.800
 What is that telling me?

01:35:49.800 --> 01:36:00.800
 That usually the estrogen is very high, increasing the serotonin, which is what activates the

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:04.800
 peristalsis too much, causing the diarrhea.

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:14.800
 And so reducing inflammation, gradually nourishing the liver so that it can regulate those hormones.

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:22.800
 Do you think it's reasonable to take milk thistle and things like that to keep the liver

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:25.800
 happy and cleaner and stuff like that?

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:32.800
 Several of those natural plant substances can be anti-inflammatory.

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:39.800
 And for example, for mushroom poisoning, milk thistle is a lifesaver.

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:48.800
 But I knew one woman who was having chronic liver enzyme elevation and taking milk thistle

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:49.800
 for it.

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:59.800
 And when she stopped the large doses of milk thistle, her liver immediately returned to

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:00.800
 normal.

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:04.800
 So an excess of milk thistle can be irritating to the liver.

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:07.800
 Does Dr. Peat ever recommend doing blood tests?

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:09.800
 And can we learn something from them?

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:13.800
 Or are they just a snapshot in time?

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:15.800
 They can be useful.

01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:19.800
 That's where lots of our information comes from.

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:27.800
 But I don't generally advise people to do it because the doctors are going to misinterpret

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:28.800
 them anyway.

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.800
 Yeah, you really have to have a good interpreter to do that.

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:32.800
 Yeah.

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:39.800
 Is cancer, writes Leroy, is cancer caused by too few or too many electrons?

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:50.800
 Yeah, the reductive stress where your vitamin C instead of being in the oxidized form becomes

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:59.800
 reductive, the excess electrons activate iron to make it a toxic reductant.

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:06.800
 Cancer characteristically has a great excess of reducing power.

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:11.800
 And so it's an electron excess condition.

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.800
 A couple more then we'll let you go to work.

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:17.800
 What role does water play in regulating body temperature?

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:24.800
 Can hydration keep my fingers warmer in the winter?

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:31.800
 The hydration in the sense of blood volume does improve circulation, but that requires

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:40.800
 a balance of sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and that's regulated by hormones such as thyroid

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:44.800
 and progesterone to optimize the blood volume.

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:53.800
 And that will usually take care of how much water you take in and put out by adjusting

01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:57.800
 your thirst and kidney action.

01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:12.800
 But the healthy person with a good 2,500 calorie daily consumption should be evaporating at

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:17.800
 least two liters of water just in their breath and from their skin.

01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:18.800
 Wow.

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:19.800
 Yeah.

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:23.800
 One of our listeners said that on our first show we did with you long ago, you had about

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:29.800
 five, six, seven minutes that really explained the way to properly prepare grains.

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:31.800
 And we won't go into it now.

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:35.800
 So we're going to dig that out and maybe make a file and let people listen to that.

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:41.800
 So there is a way, and I don't even remember it all, that we can work with grains to make

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:45.800
 them much more user-friendly for the body.

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:47.800
 Alkali cooking.

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:48.800
 Alkali cooking.

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:58.800
 Yeah, it was mixed tamaleization, the tamale tortilla masa arena method.

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:02.800
 And you explained that all on the original show.

01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:07.800
 So yeah, we'll get people to be able to hear that so they can do that.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:13.800
 Linda says, "Do coffee enemas deplete iron or is donating blood the only way to lower

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:16.800
 excess iron?"

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:22.800
 Drinking quite a bit of coffee is helpful because it reduces the absorption of iron

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:23.800
 from your food.

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:24.800
 Really?

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:32.800
 And the enemas would have some of that effect, but I think just a regular having coffee with

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:36.800
 every iron-rich food is very protective.

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:38.800
 Here's a final one for you, then we'll let you go.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:44.800
 Can you explain the difference, writes Ben, between hydrogenated coconut oil, not oil,

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:48.800
 and extra virgin coconut oil?

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:58.800
 Yeah, extra virgin oil has all of the aroma and good flavor, but it also has 2 or 3% of

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:00.800
 PUFA left in it.

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:06.800
 And it has some proteins, which for some people are allergenic.

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:14.800
 The hydrogenated has been not only thoroughly deodorized so there's no taste, but it has

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:18.800
 been treated so there's no PUFA left.

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:26.800
 So it's extremely, coconut oil itself is very stable against oxidation, but the hydrogenated

01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:32.800
 form is essentially resistant.

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:35.800
 You just don't have the breakdown.

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.800
 There's no PUFA there to break down.

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:39.800
 You think it's a better choice, hydrogenated?

01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:41.800
 It's what I use.

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:44.800
 I've never really seen it, but I guess you can find it.

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:46.800
 Do they sell it in the health food stores?

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:50.800
 Not yet, but there are a few places on the internet.

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:57.800
 The first time I got it, it was a free sample from the company, but the shipping was $200.

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:05.800
 But what about all this negative stuff that was said years ago about partially hydrogenated

01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:10.800
 this and that, and even Whole Foods took all that stuff out of their ingredients?

01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:20.800
 Yeah, if you partially hydrogenate soy oil or corn oil, a tremendous amount of the intermediates,

01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:22.800
 which are potentially toxic.

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:30.800
 But if you start with only 2% or 3% of the PUFA, then the process goes to completion.

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.800
 There are none of the intermediates left.

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:38.800
 Oh, so it's not partially, it's just hydrogenated, which is a different quality of the product.

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:45.800
 Yeah, for example, a Russian study, they knew that peanut oil in itself is toxic, but when

01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:54.800
 they hydrogenated it and gave it to animals, it restored aged mitochondria to their youthful

01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:55.800
 ability to oxidize.

01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:57.800
 Oh, P. Turner.

01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:01.800
 Those Russians, they've got some pretty interesting research over there, don't they?

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:04.800
 They're really into longevity on a deep level, I guess.

01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:05.800
 Yeah.

01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:08.800
 That's why they drink a lot of vodka, that'll pickle you.

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:09.800
 Yeah.

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:13.800
 Well, Dr. Peat, what a joy having you here.

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:18.800
 We covered a lot of territory, and I appreciate you being so generous with your time.

01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:20.800
 Thanks so much.

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.800
 Okay, thank you.

01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:25.800
 Okay, hope you had as good a time as we did.

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:26.800
 Bye-bye.
