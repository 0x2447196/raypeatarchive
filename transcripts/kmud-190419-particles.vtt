00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 Well, once again, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:16.480
 It's April 19th, 2019, and this is Ask Your Herb Doctor. KMUD Garville 91.1 FM proudly hosts this

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.920
 free speech independent radio program that we do the third Friday of every month. And from 6.30

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.480
 until 7 o'clock, callers are invited to call with questions either related to this month's

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.520
 continuing topic of antiviral herbs, and we're going to break into nanoparticles and their

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.720
 health effects, negative health effects, and also looking a little more at some other articles

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.120
 surrounding polyunsaturated fats and cancer incidence. So that'll be something we'll bring

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.080
 out here. The tide is slowly changing and slowly turning, and as Dr. Peat has said and has been

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.960
 famously quoted in the past, "A lie gets around the world quicker than truth can tie up her shoelaces."

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.480
 So once again, we're very welcome to have Dr. Peat join us on the radio show live. You there, Dr. Peat?

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.880
 Yes, hello. Thanks so much for joining us. I just first wanted to start a very brief introduction

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:25.200
 into some of the things that we're going to cover again this evening, which is a kind of follow-up

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.880
 from the last couple of months that we haven't finished, but I won't dwell too great length on

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:39.120
 it. The antiviral activity of selected medicinal plants for which there are plenty of articles.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.280
 If you look at PubMed, for example, you can type in the Latin name of a plant and type in

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.800
 "antiviral activity" and you can get a host of search results that will come back with

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.400
 clinical trials that have been done on that plant for that known virus, whether it's herpes or

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.800
 hepatitis or whatever. So whilst we know that the source of this information may not be

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.960
 fully accurate, as is always the case with everything, PubMed is one of those places that

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.720
 does supposedly publish, you know, reviewed articles and like ResearchGate and other

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.640
 affiliates, is at this point, I think, probably one of the only real avenues that we have to look

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.560
 for the results that we hope are not skewed and tell the facts like they are. I know I've

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.560
 interviewed Dr. Peat and many times he's quoted supposedly scientific research articles that are

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.720
 nothing of the sort and has pointed out blatant errors in the research and has put the record

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:49.760
 straight. I think before I carry on, I would like to get you, Dr. Peat, just to introduce yourself

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.440
 to people who maybe haven't heard of you before, though I think your fame is spreading around the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.560
 world. But if you just outline your academic and professional background for people that have maybe

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.760
 not heard of you before, and also, like I've said, you know, all of these programs will be

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.440
 on an Instagram page and we'll be doing a fairly intensive Ray Peat based ideology Instagram page

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.840
 for people to find all of the information that you've been talking about rather than

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:26.000
 recapitulated from various websites that are purporting to be Dr. Peat friendly, some of which

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.760
 suggesting things that I know you wouldn't suggest. So just for people listening tonight,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.040
 it's April 2019 here now and hopefully in the next two months or so we'll have an opening

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:45.840
 Instagram page and we're going to chronologically as well as by subject matter list it in a logical

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.720
 sequence for people to educate themselves from the very beginning of your work, Dr. Peat,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.360
 which was on polyunsaturates and thyroid and hormones. But anyway, enough of me. Would you

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:06.720
 just introduce yourself? Between 1968 and 72, I studied biology, emphasizing physiology,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.040
 especially reproductive physiology at the University of Oregon. But I didn't start

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:26.720
 academic study of biology until I had about 20 years of investigating controversies in biology and

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:36.400
 having decided that academic biology, especially in the US, was too dogmatic and commercial

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:46.720
 to really be scientific. But I finally decided to go through the academic process and find out

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:57.200
 some of its weaknesses in the process. And after getting a PhD, I discontinued my independent

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:07.200
 studying, doing nutrition counseling, hormone counseling, and studying how the brain,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.680
 reproductive and immune systems in particular, interact with the environment, especially

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.160
 nutrition. You've been a big proponent for a long time now of getting people to stop

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:30.880
 using polyunsaturates, quoting Burr and other people who had previously studied this and were

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:39.040
 supporting it in the mid-30s or 40s and from there on. And you've always mentioned the fact that the

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.800
 paint industry was a big user of these vegetable oils and that when the petroleum industry came

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.280
 into being, synthetic additives and paints were then manufactured from petroleum and put the

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.120
 seed oil producers at risk. And so they decided to put these seed oils into the food chain.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:04.560
 And for a long, long time now, as I grew up in the 70s, the polyunsaturates and the sunflower oil and

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:11.760
 everything else was margarine, it was just advertised everywhere as the heart-healthy

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.160
 wonder oil. And the things that our forebears had used, very natural products like saturated

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:26.960
 fat from beef, these kinds of things, animal fats and animal products even, largely.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:36.320
 A big study in veterans of the heart-healthy diet with margarine found that it not only

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:43.600
 caused more cancer, but also increased deaths from heart disease. And that was a turning point

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.320
 against the original essential fatty acids and that set the background for fish oil to come on

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.240
 the market. Yeah, okay. Well, I think probably, if this is not the order, I was going to ask you

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:04.960
 some questions related to things from antiviral components in medicinal herbs that you probably

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.360
 have read about and you would understand and be able to elucidate somewhat from your perspective

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.760
 of how they work, especially those we've talked about in the past, the dark pigments, the anthocyanin

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.920
 pigments that you have described as being radical quenching because they have the ability to mop up

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:30.400
 electrons and suppress inflammation and that kind of thing. But let me just, and I didn't send

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.560
 any of this to you, but I read this article, it just came out of the blue as I was looking at

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:42.720
 articles to support a negative detrimental effect from polyunsaturates because,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.480
 gosh, you type in polyunsaturates and all you find is how good they are, how healthy they are,

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.920
 how cardiovascular friendly they are, how you can't live without them and how you'd be crazy

00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:01.840
 not to use them. So there's a strength pushed in the industry weighed on the pro-polyunsaturates

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:08.800
 side that it's very difficult to find evidence for the opposite. But I came across this article

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:15.680
 and it's entitled "Are diets high in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids unhealthy?"

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:24.400
 and this came out of work that was done at the University Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.440
 and it said that, just I want to quote a small paragraph from it and then we'll carry on

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.200
 in the order that I think we were going to do this subject in with antivirals and then move on to

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:44.160
 nanotechnology as an emerging potential problem. But anyway, it said that in the introduction,

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.800
 and I am quoting the introduction here, so for people that might even come across this article,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.160
 yeah, it's plagiarism in some ways, but I just want to directly quote the article.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:59.120
 It said, "Israel has one of the highest dietary polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratios in the

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:05.760
 world. The population consumes some 8% more omega-6 PUFAs than in the USA and some 10 to 12%

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.920
 more than in most European countries. Israeli Jews may be regarded as a population-based dietary

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:18.160
 experiment of the effect of a high omega-6 PUFA diet on disease, one of which until recently was

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.440
 widely recommended. Despite such national habits, paradoxically there is a high prevalence of

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:30.240
 cardiovascular diseases from hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:36.160
 and obesity, all diseases which are associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance,

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.600
 and grouped together as the insulin-resistant syndrome or syndrome X. There is also an

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.720
 increased cancer incidence and mortality rate, especially in women, in comparison with Western

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:53.520
 countries. Studies suggest that high linoleic acid consumption might aggravate hyperinsulinemia

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.000
 and insulin resistance, as well as being a substrate for lipid peroxidation and free

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.040
 radical formation, which I know you've mentioned extensively. Thus far from being beneficial,

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.880
 high omega-6 PUFA diets may have some serious long-term effects, acting as the link between

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:17.120
 hyperinsulinemia, atherosclerosis, and carcinogenesis. So what do you think of that article?

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.080
 Very good.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:25.840
 So you've got to search. I don't know if it's had any bearing on the search results, folks,

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.400
 and I don't want you to interpret what I'm going to say as just the way that's evidence of it,

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:39.120
 but I was using Startpage as my browser and increasingly going off Google, which I think

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.400
 obviously has become de facto for a lot of people just because it's so ubiquitous, but I truly

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:51.120
 believe, and this is my own personal opinion, that Google are streamlining results based on

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:58.080
 search terms that suit their agenda, folks. A couple of sociologists recently did a study

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:09.360
 on Google-like search engine, and they slightly jiggered the frequency of particular names of

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:18.800
 political candidates. They thought they might be able to rig the choice in an election by two or

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:27.520
 three percent. It turned out they were getting a 48 percent false result just by which name they

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:34.560
 favored with the search engine. Very horrifying about what Google could be doing.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.520
 Absolutely, and this mirrors what I said very early on in the beginning of that,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:46.000
 that you have to be careful where you get your results from because even published medical data

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 is skewed and it's abused and data is misinterpreted or downright corrected in favor

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.920
 of the results they're looking for. And so it is with the internet as well. I mean, it is paradoxical

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.800
 that there's a wealth of information out there, but you've really got to be careful that now I

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:14.000
 think the information increasingly so is becoming manipulated by the main players in the world of

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.280
 the internet, you know, in terms of search engine results, and that's Google. Obviously, there are

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:27.040
 other players, but Google is one of the biggest, and certainly becoming a bone to contend with in

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:34.320
 terms of being objective about where you're getting your information from without being on the fact

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:42.480
 checking side of paranoia. There is definitely a weight of evidence to show that a lot of the

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.840
 search terms are being manipulated in terms of algorithms that are produced by these companies to

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:53.440
 either show or hide results that you would normally find. But anyway, so the start page

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.000
 came up with this and it was at the end of the day, and I didn't even have time, Dr. Peate,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.280
 to put this into any kind of introduction for the show and the questions, but I thought that

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:09.360
 was quite interesting. I'll probably take a look at some start page search terms in terms of PUFA

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.040
 and its negative effects, because like I said, you generally just find all the positive stuff on.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:23.120
 Okay, so you've talked about naringenin before several times in different contexts as

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:31.440
 antioxidant. Do you, and I don't know that you do, I'm just putting it out there that perhaps you've

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:42.800
 have a way of explaining naringenin's potential antiviral effects, because I know that there are

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:50.160
 quite a few studies that are showing naringenin as a preparation for herpes simplex virus being

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:56.560
 fairly effective and not knowing as much perhaps as you do about naringenin and its activity. I

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.840
 wondered if you'd know anything that would support that? Oh yeah, I think it works the same way

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:10.080
 as aspirin and progesterone and all of the cell stabilizers work. It increases the oxidative

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:19.680
 balance of the cell, simply reinforcing the effect of the oxidative respiratory metabolism,

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:30.880
 and that makes the cell able to resist improper excitation, stabilizes it against random

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:43.120
 irritation, and just about anything that is unphysiological will destabilize the cell in the

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:54.320
 same direction. So these things protect against viruses, radiation, vibration, oxygen deprivation,

00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:02.560
 sugar deprivation, too much of the polyunsaturated fats, and too much phosphate, too little calcium,

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:11.360
 just anything that shifts the balance towards meaningless excitation or reducing

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:18.080
 proper energy production. Okay, so this is a cell stabilizing component,

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:28.400
 which also has an antiviral effect because of its energy saving effect rather than allowing

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:35.040
 the cell to become excited and in an exciter toxic way, wasting energy and being unstable.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:42.640
 Yeah, when the virus wants to replicate, it excites the cell, gets the cell churning its

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:52.560
 mechanism and that damages the organism, produces more viruses. Yeah. Okay, so there's naringenin,

00:15:52.560 --> 00:16:00.640
 that was that one, and mainly oranges and lemons, the peel, but I found actually there was a greater

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:06.560
 proportion of naringenin actually in the membrane. So this is that kind of white pithy membrane that

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.720
 you'll find either in between the segments of the fruit or just underneath the surface of the skin.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.000
 So you're listening to Ask Urib, Dr. K. M. E. D. Garboville, 91.1 FM,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.440
 from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock. You're invited to call in our guest speaker,

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:29.280
 Dr. Raymond Peat, covering a few antiviral herbs before we get into the subject of particulates,

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:38.720
 especially the nanoparticulates and nanotechnology. The number here is area code 707-9233911.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.800
 Okay, then I guess I'll very quickly just mention, because I don't see too much

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:53.280
 conclusive evidence here, but hemidesmus, which was Indian sarsaparilla, I saw a few articles there

00:16:53.280 --> 00:17:00.320
 about its herpes simplex 1 and 2 activity, but then I wanted to mention pomegranate. I think

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:07.760
 this is a fairly ancient fruit that's been mentioned since biblical times, and an article

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:15.280
 that mentioned the effect of zinc in conjunction with pomegranate rind extract being eight times

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:21.280
 greater in its viricidal activity than an equivalent mass of just purely pomegranate extract.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:28.160
 I would understand the pomegranate again to being fairly antioxidant, as I think that's the main

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:34.160
 reason it's juiced and sold as its potential health benefits. But from the point of view of

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:41.760
 the ion zinc, I think it has been used, it obviously uses a sun blocker, and I think zinc

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:50.720
 on its own has been touted as a healing agent for speeding up the healing process in cold sores.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:57.040
 Do you have anything to say on zinc or what you've heard or read before that would support

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:04.560
 any activity there? I think the protein synthesizing function of zinc is like vitamin A

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:11.360
 for accelerating healing. So the protein synthesizing effect, and this would be why it

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:18.080
 would be used in the production of sperm? Yeah. Interesting. Okay. All right. And then

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:24.560
 something that I'd have a kind of personal relationship with, if you like, between this

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:32.240
 one and the next one is birch bark extract. And I had an article that was published by the

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:41.200
 University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Romania on betulin. And betulin and betulinic acid

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:49.840
 were two ingredients that were used for this and had some pretty good results with it in treating

00:18:51.280 --> 00:19:00.400
 melanomas and colon and cervical cancer. And this study seemed to show here that the

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.680
 double staining analysis that was conducted on the cells after they were treated

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:13.680
 measured the activity of the cell enzymes which were responsible for angiogenesis. And this was

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:20.800
 the rationale by which the extract had a anti-cancer effect was that it directly

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.880
 interfered with angiogenesis and creation of new blood vessels. Structurally, betulinic acid is

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:34.240
 analogous to progesterone. And it's a triterpene, isn't it? Sarsaparilla, I think, has a similar

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:43.920
 steroid. Okay. Yeah. They call it a pentacyclic triterpene. Interesting. Okay. So they had this

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:51.520
 trial of X amount of people. And they said that it was fairly significant, its effects. And so

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:58.880
 they were calling out birch bark as a good source of betulinic acid and production of betulin.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:06.400
 And there was one other tree, another tree actually, was the red alder. And they said also

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.520
 that Native Americans use the bark of the red alder tree to treat a variety of inflammatory

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:18.320
 conditions from poison oak to other inflammatory skin conditions as well as TB. Okay. So that's

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:24.000
 birch bark. And I want to just mention here briefly, and I'm doing a kind of trial myself,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.600
 I know when we spoke maybe two months ago about skin cancers, I had, actually, it was the beginning

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:38.640
 of the year, wasn't it? With Simoncini, the Italian doctor here who had, you know, a bunch

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:50.400
 of YouTube channels talking about iodine and his belief that there was a fungal origin of cancer,

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:57.280
 or especially candida as an origin of cancers, and that iodine's use was implicated in treating that

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:04.560
 because of its antifungal effect. So I got a product from Australia. And in Australia,

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:14.560
 there has been probably for about 20 years now, a patented herb-based product for skin cancer.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:21.280
 And it works for both actinic keratosis, which is a kind of pre-cancerous, it's called a cancer,

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:30.400
 but it's a pre-cancerous lesion. Then obviously the basal and squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:38.240
 So this particular plant is a solanaceous plant, so belonging to the tomato family,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:46.640
 called Solanum sodomasium. There are other solanums that do have these solacidine glycosides.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:57.520
 Aubergine is one of them. And I have a herbalist in England. He's about 82. I met his daughter

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.800
 while we were studying. She's like a second generation herbalist there. But anyway,

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.320
 he produces this cream. He bases on both aubergine and birch bark.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.840
 And we call aubergine eggplant. Eggplant. Okay, there you go. So for

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.000
 those people that are listening, I'm talking about the eggplant. So anyway,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.680
 both the aubergine and this Solanum sodomasium both contain Solamargine.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:26.560
 And these are the glycosides that are attached, actually, rhamnose sugars that are attached

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:36.400
 to this Solamargine and directly kill cancer cells specifically and leave normal cells intact.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.880
 And so he's actually patented this. I think it was a biochemistry doctor.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.560
 And 25 years ago, he patented this product and it's been sold all over the world. And you can

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:52.080
 go on the website and you can, I think it's about 60 to 65% effective. It's not 100% effective 100%

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.080
 of the time. But there's quite a lot of anecdotal evidence there from people that have used it.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:01.360
 And they've got nothing but good things to say about it. So anyway, I wanted to mention that I

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:08.800
 had on my forearms from sun damage, what I believe, but again, this is anecdotal for me, I never had a

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:15.040
 biopsy taken to tell me that it was cancerous or precancerous, but definitely these raised,

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:22.240
 you know, irregular, bordered, pearly gray, sinister looking skin lesions that I just,

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:31.040
 and I used 7% iodine on them. And the results from both of that are that after about 60 days,

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:38.320
 they totally gone. So it took about 60 days. But I've no visible sign of anything left there that

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.520
 was there previously. And I'll keep an eye on it to see how it goes. But at the same time,

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:47.520
 I purchased this Curidone from Australia and I've been using that on what I have on the bridge of

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:53.280
 my nose, which I've had probably for a couple of years, has just stubbornly resisted any and

00:23:53.280 --> 00:24:00.240
 everything I put on it. But it's unequivocal at this point in time, because the results are still

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:07.120
 waiting. And so Dr. Peat, in terms of cancers and skin cancers, especially, I know it's a little

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:13.040
 bit of a touchy subject from a global warming perspective, you know, if the planet's heating

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:18.640
 up or if we're losing our ozone layer. But cancers are definitely on the rise. And I think before we

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:25.920
 get into the rapid increase in cancer incidences, and we have some facts and analysis from a few

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:33.040
 departments that have done studies on this, in terms of cancer and skin cancer, do you have

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:41.120
 a way of defining it or a way that you would understand it outside of, you know, the regular

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.440
 kind of sunburn causing genetic changes type approach? You know, that's...

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:56.560
 Oh, for melanoma, sun really isn't the main factor. Most melanomas occur in

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:05.520
 areas that aren't much exposed to the sun, back and inside of the thighs, even on the bottom of

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:17.120
 the feet. And it's a very hormone sensitive thing. Estrogen has been suspected for a long time of

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:29.680
 being involved in it. I've seen dozens of apparent melanomas that disappeared. A couple of people who

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:37.680
 were diagnosed with terminal melanoma, a very advanced metastatic, it regressed when they

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:48.000
 changed their diet, used coffee, aspirin, and various nutritional things, vitamin D,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:56.800
 a lot of orange juice and milk and such. Is this an anti-estrogenic type approach in that you're...

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:07.920
 Yeah. And so far, all of the melanoma people that I've talked to have had a really quick

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:15.760
 response from changing their diet. Interesting. Okay. Have you come across many people yourself

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:21.520
 that have had, I don't know, either actinic keratosis or basal or squamous cell carcinomas

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:31.040
 that have been treated effectively without any medical intervention? Yeah. The first one I saw,

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:43.760
 man, about 80, 45 years ago, put progesterone on his diagnosed lip cancer. Okay. And in a week or

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:50.880
 so, it was gone. Interesting. Okay. We'll be coming up to 730 here. So just to remind people again,

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:59.920
 this is AskYourOvDoctor, 91.1 KM UD, 91.1 FM, and the number is 707-923-3911.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:09.600
 I got your recent newsletter, Dr. Peat, and I have definitely wondered about it myself,

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:17.760
 as like everything else, whenever you tamper with nature, things usually don't go too well.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:24.800
 Obviously, there are some cases where we interfere with things and hopefully make them better.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:30.320
 But nature does a pretty good job of selecting out the good from the bad. And I think we've

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:38.320
 gotten where we are because of its job doing that. So nanotechnology is a rapidly progressing

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:45.360
 science, a little bit like CRISPR gene editing. I think it's got the same kind of mystique and

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:53.760
 similar kind of fears surrounding it. It's found in many different products. It's not just something

00:27:53.760 --> 00:28:01.680
 that builds nanotubules, for example, to promote ultra light strong structure, but it's put in

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:12.000
 skin creams. It's added to foods. I got an article that I don't have to read at this point in time,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.680
 because I'd like to get your feedback on the whole nanotech industry and where you see it

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:26.960
 causing problems and what you think would be the right approach to its development. And it's,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:35.360
 you know, coming into being a part of our science and not getting away from us like a Pandora's box

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:42.320
 opening. But what's your opinion on nanotechnology, where it's come from and how fast it's moving?

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:59.520
 I'm not sure exactly where the industry came from. People have recognized that particles like soot

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:09.120
 spontaneously makes these highly structured ultramicroscopic particles.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:22.320
 The industry, I think about 30 or 40 years after they recognized that these things were happening,

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:33.360
 they thought up things to do with them. About 35 years ago, I had some contact with the

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:41.280
 chemical industry and without asking for it, they sent me two gallon sized containers that

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:48.720
 weighed almost nothing, a sample of their products that they wanted to promote. I screwed the top off

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:58.240
 one of them and the material floated out like smoke. It was fumed silica, which is now being

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:09.040
 added to toothpaste and can be included in foods. It makes salad dressings seem more creamy.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.720
 How long ago was this?

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.640
 35 years ago.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:26.960
 Anyway, it worried me that the stuff floats right into the air. It's dangerous to be around.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:36.320
 I closed it up and set it aside. I didn't know how to dispose of it in an ecologically safe way.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:50.000
 The stuff can get into groundwater. Things of that sort are produced naturally by friction,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.600
 tires on the highway, and smoke coming out of engines.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.680
 Right, diesel engines.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:10.880
 Yeah, so it's something being produced by ordinary processes of industry and social activities,

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:19.520
 but they're deliberately manufacturing it in vast amounts and thinking of new ways to

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:32.000
 make clothing, deodorant, antiseptic, control heat and moisture better.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:41.120
 But these particles, even in clothes, the fine particles, if they contact sweaty skin,

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:47.520
 actually can pass through the skin into the bloodstream in small amounts.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:55.520
 Interesting. You mentioned soot, and that just reminds me of the chimney sweeps in the

00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:01.200
 late 1800s in England. They would get testicular cancer. It was a well-known

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:06.800
 result. So that's funny that you mentioned that. I mean, soot is

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.360
 an ultra-fine nanoparticle in its own right, huh?

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:18.160
 Yeah, and it contains estrogenic as well as carcinogenic chemicals. But the particles

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:24.800
 themselves, because of their shape and size, the reason asbestos is carcinogenic

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:35.040
 is its fine-pointed crystalline structure. And more or less spherical particles,

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:43.200
 if they're as small as the point of an asbestos crystal, the body interprets the...

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:53.440
 I think it's probably related to viral immune processes. It starts an inflammatory process

00:32:53.440 --> 00:33:02.560
 when the particle has a certain fineness or length to diameter ratio. A sharp particle or

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:11.440
 a very small particle activates the inflammatory process, which excites a whole system of the cell

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:22.560
 in the activity, which if you have the biological energy, you can segregate, isolate, and tamp down

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:32.320
 that excitation and recover. But when it becomes either too frequent, too intense,

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:42.720
 or your energy level decreases, the balance shifts towards inflammation, degeneration,

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:47.440
 production of fibrous tissues rather than functional tissues.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:55.520
 Interesting. I came across an article that was put out by the National University of Singapore,

00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:04.160
 and the phenomena, they called it "nanomaterial-induced endothelial leakiness" or

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:13.040
 "nano-L" for short. They had recorded the fact that this nano-L process accelerated the movement

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:19.520
 of cancer cells from the primary tumor and also caused circulating cancer cells to escape from

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:26.880
 the circulatory system. Because these nanoparticles created a gap physically within the

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:33.280
 endothelia large enough for cells to come in and out of, so thus evading what would normally be a

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:40.800
 host immune response within the vasculature. They physically were able to leak out of these spaces,

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:46.240
 and so that was one direct way in which nanoparticles had been implicated in causing

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:54.080
 cancer. Most of the places are talking about gaps between cells, but that leakiness, it's really

00:34:54.080 --> 00:35:04.880
 a basic thing that excess excitation or energy deficiency causes to happen in all cells,

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:14.000
 that the substance of the cell leaks out. In a hypothyroid person, for example, if you exercise

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.640
 the muscle too much, it leaks its enzymes right through the surface of the cell, and

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:32.000
 particles, relatively big particles on the scale of these nanomaterials of the cell emit its own

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.880
 nanoparticles right through the surface of the cell when it's stressed. The leakiness is an

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:47.280
 intrinsic property of the cytoplasm when it's under stress, but they talk about it in terms of

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:55.120
 gaps because they have a membrane barrier. It's mechanistic again, isn't it? I keep having to

00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:01.760
 check myself every time I talk to you, you come up with this and it's, yep, okay, the textbooks

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:07.360
 interpret this physiologically one way because that's the way they want you to remember it,

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:14.000
 that's the way they want to teach it and propagate it, but that is a much more fluid dynamic system

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.160
 that's in place rather than this rigid mechanistic, you know, lock and key type approach that they've

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:28.640
 always stuck by. Just giving the cell glucose to get its energy up can stop that leakiness,

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:35.600
 and one of the interesting things about cancer, the tumors, instead of looking at

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:43.040
 what's inside the cancer cell, someone looked at what's outside of the cells in a tumor. They found

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:51.120
 there was a thousand times more ATP in the fluid of a tumor than in normal tissues. The cells are

00:36:51.120 --> 00:37:00.320
 leaky and they're leaking their necessary materials so fast that they are constantly in this

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.720
 over-simulated condition. This would be an energy depleted state too, right? Yeah.

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:12.960
 They're losing their basic building block for energy production. Interesting. Okay, so you're

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.840
 listening to Ask U. I'm Dr. K. M. D. Galbavool, 91.1 FM. From now until the end of the show,

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:24.080
 you're invited to call in. The number is 707-923-3911, and if we don't hear from you,

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:28.960
 which would be very unusual, I would just imagine that you're listening. Anyway, so Dr. Peat,

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:40.160
 in terms of an anti-inflammatory strategy for life, I know you've mentioned many substances which

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:47.040
 many people that we've worked with have changed their diet and their lifestyle,

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:54.320
 but in terms of energy, it's really everything that you've touched on this evening in these

00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:01.360
 different subjects is based on an energy-wasting perspective that causes cancer and that the

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:10.720
 leakiness of a cell, for example, could be based on inflammatory mediators like estrogen and how

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:20.400
 energy-wasteful an estrogenic environment is. This is quite probably why, and I'm totally sold on the

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:29.360
 whole thyroid thing, because the fundamental basis of human life is energy. Everything in the universe

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:40.000
 is energy. I'm not being flippant or braggadocious or anything, but energy is the sum basis of

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:48.160
 everything that we see, do, and see. So thyroid hormone and glucose strike me as the two biggest

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:57.520
 fuels, substances that promote energy because the whole process of ATP and muscular movement,

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:04.160
 for example, requires glucose splitting to drive the whole Krebs cycle and produce energy. So

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:10.960
 when the thyroid hormone is low or it's compromised because of blocks to its production or uptake or

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:17.680
 synthesis, then naturally the organism is going to get weaker and there's going to come a point where

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:24.400
 you exceed the ability to put up with that and then you start getting into a diseased state.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.480
 The engineer's got his finger up and he's got his finger up for a reason.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:34.560
 Okay, we have a caller. Let's get this next caller on the air. Caller, where are you from and what's

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:41.040
 your question? I'm from Redway and my question is, would you please go over the information

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:49.760
 about the Australian herbal topical cream for acne keratosis once again and can it be obtained

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:58.240
 online? Yeah, okay. So the product is called Curaderm, C-U-R-A-D-E-R-M, Curaderm, and it's

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:04.480
 trademarked, it's patented, and yes, you can get it online. There's several different outlets,

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:10.640
 but the place that I did get it from was from Australia, but I think there are several European

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:17.280
 outlets for it. So that's what you want to type in and you'll find that information online,

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:21.360
 no problem. Thank you very much. Yeah, you're welcome. Okay, so we have another caller on the

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:26.000
 air. Caller, you're on the air and where are you from? What's your question? Hello, I'm in Eureka.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.960
 Eureka, welcome to the show. Thank you. I've got questions about Parkinson's. Okay.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:42.000
 What is kind of a good direction to take, go with that? Okay, do you have a radio on in the

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.040
 background at all? No, I have... All right, it's just a little bit of feedback. Okay,

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:51.280
 so your main question is Parkinson's and the best way forward with Parkinson's?

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:57.360
 Yes. Yeah, so Dr. Peat, Parkinson's, I know it's multifactorial and what they call Parkinson's now,

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:02.240
 I've also seen recent research showing that it's actually multifactorial, the

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:08.560
 neurofibrillary tangles and all the rest of the physiological findings, sometimes

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:13.600
 they're way before the symptoms and actually they're now wanting to break it down into

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:20.080
 five or six different causative organisms that could be responsible. But what's your view on

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:30.000
 Parkinson's? Keeping testosterone and related steroids up, the neurosteroids are very protective

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:37.360
 and testosterone has just been identified as one thing that goes down in relation to Parkinson's,

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:44.960
 but the pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone are all nerve protective

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:55.920
 and restorative. Vitamin D is another steroid that is extremely protective to the nerve cells.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:03.440
 What was that one last one you said? The vitamin D. I take vitamin D. How much do I take?

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:11.680
 And phosphate should be reduced in the diet along with the pro-inflammatory fatty acids,

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:21.040
 so more carbohydrate and sugar and any good source of calcium and magnesium,

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:31.440
 milk, cheese, green vegetables, well cooked, but less beans, nuts, and meat

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:39.360
 because of their high phosphate content. So testosterone will be first and foremost in

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:44.560
 terms of what Dr. Peat said about its neuroprotective effects and for males very

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:50.640
 importantly and not so difficult to achieve. In terms of Dr. Peat's recommendations for

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:56.000
 light weight-bearing exercise would be the best way to improve your general testosterone as a

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.360
 male. Obviously avoiding the estrogenic substances is another no-brainer because estrogen directly

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:10.720
 antagonizes testosterone and so to avoid all of the polyunsaturates in the diet. Obviously,

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:18.640
 there's things from plastics interfering with hormones, etc., causing xenoestrogenic effects.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:24.000
 So the food that you eat, you need to be careful, nuts, beans, and seeds to avoid those from the

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:31.600
 polyunsaturated perspective and then to either use thyroid hormone if you are low thyroid and

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:37.360
 you can check that with your temperature impulses and also things like aspirin,

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:43.680
 good anti-inflammatories for reducing generalized inflammation. And fibrous foods because they

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:51.440
 help to reduce the reabsorption of estrogen in the intestine and because Parkinson's

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:59.600
 almost always involves sluggish intestinal movement. Constipation, yeah, there you go.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:07.440
 Okay, so did you get that list? Yeah, let's see, vitamin D, testosterone,

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:16.000
 DHA, thyroid hormone, making sure you're getting enough sugars in your diet, making sure your

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.760
 bowels are working, you know, you're not constipated or clearing up any constipation

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:25.920
 that you have because you can reabsorb estrogen from the bowel. All of those pro-testosterone

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:36.240
 things, pro-energy things and anti-estrogenic and inflammatory mediated in the causative

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:44.000
 substances like the PUFA, the polyunsaturates in the food chain. Yeah, okay, all right. Well,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.680
 if you need any other questions, we've got at the end of the show, I'll give out the best way to

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:54.880
 contact myself and how to find Dr. Peat's articles. I'm sure, in fact, I know there are a couple of

00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:00.480
 articles on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and those kind of neurodegenerative processes that you could

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:05.520
 go ahead and read. So call it, we have another call on the air. So let's take this call away

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:13.120
 from what's your question? I'm dealing with peripheral neuropathy in my feet, caused by

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:24.240
 chemotherapy. And I'm wondering, you were talking about less estrogen producing foods and

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:33.600
 more testosterone. Anyway, if you could save the list of things to avoid,

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:44.560
 or if there's a way to get that, I would be very grateful. Because it is an inflammation

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:54.800
 at an incredible level. It's very, very, very painful. And I've been taking some pain pills

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.280
 when I just can't stand, I can't stand taking the pills and I can't stand the pain.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:06.640
 Anything you could do that might mitigate or suggest that might mitigate the inflammation

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:12.720
 would be great. Okay, so Dr. Peat, peripheral neuropathy post chemotherapy.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:30.640
 The nerve regeneration, peripheral as well as central, there have been many studies in animals

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:37.760
 showing that vitamin D and progesterone work together to restore nerves. I think it's a good

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:43.760
 idea to have a blood test for both vitamin D and progesterone and keep the vitamin D

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:53.360
 at least in the middle of the normal range, 50 nanograms per milliliter is good, 50 or 60.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:47:04.320
 And progesterone should be in the luteal range, even for postmenopausal women is good to

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:13.040
 supplement it if it isn't naturally detectable. And this is because it's directly opposing

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:23.440
 estrogen. Yeah, and the serum tests for estrogen are meaningful if you don't have a good amount of

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:33.280
 progesterone because after menopause, estrogen begins forming inside cells all through the body,

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:40.960
 fat cells, skin cells, breast, uterine cells, everywhere that you don't want it, it can be

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:54.160
 formed from adrenal precursors and the anti-inflammatory things, aspirin, progesterone

00:47:54.160 --> 00:48:03.360
 and thyroid, vitamin D and the calcium in the diet all help to minimize that inflammatory

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:12.160
 process of spontaneously forming estrogen in the tissues. Okay, aspirin, vitamin D,

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:20.880
 progesterone, thyroid hormone, I've taken that since I was in ninth grade. Which thyroid hormone?

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:35.600
 Yes, and my thyroid organ, it doesn't function. Are you taking Synthroid?

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:41.040
 I am taking Synthroid. Yeah, I've talked to a lot of people who just get no benefit whatsoever

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:48.080
 from Synthroid. I think it's a very... They can test it in my blood, for all the good that does.

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:51.600
 You can see it in your blood, but you've got to convert it yourself too to active hormone,

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:56.240
 which is sometimes a problem for people. But I just found a lot of people who I've spoken with

00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:04.080
 very disappointed with any approach that Synthroid has taken them in. And there are other alternatives.

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:12.720
 I know that Dr. Peat's mentioned alternatives to it and both the active form of T3 as well as...

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.560
 Where does that come from? Where do you get that?

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:21.920
 Well, typically, you can go to your doctor and ask for a synthetic T3. If you are diagnosed

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:27.440
 hypothyroid, there shouldn't be any problem with that. If you have an understanding doctor who,

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:32.640
 despite whatever levels you would have on a blood test, that would seem to show that you are treated

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:38.720
 and you have been treated and it seems to be within the range. If you've still got clinical

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:43.280
 symptoms of hypothyroidism, which are legion from...

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:45.360
 I've got them.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.200
 All of it. Yeah. You probably know...

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:47.920
 My whole life.

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:48.560
 Yeah, exactly.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:50:00.480
 The active thyroid hormone T3 is itself directly anti-inflammatory. But even the Synthroid, it

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:07.440
 does have the good function of suppressing TSH. So if you are taking enough to keep your TSH

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:15.680
 close to zero, that has an anti-inflammatory effect. But the main anti-inflammatory

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.240
 action of thyroid is through the T3.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:26.960
 I think my body has a problem with uptake. I think that that's always been a problem for me.

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:33.920
 And I don't have any of the organs that produce estrogen.

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:42.960
 Avoiding polyunsaturated fat is very important because it blocks the activation of thyroid

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:43.920
 into T3.

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:48.160
 I've never subscribed to that. I always thought butter was probably better.

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.260
 Good.

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:57.760
 Also with the... I'm interested in the iodine.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.780
 Okay.

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:11.680
 I mentioned earlier that a 7% iodine, I'd used it topically on two lesions on my forearms,

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:18.080
 and both of which one took significantly longer time than the other. But I'd had

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:20.720
 the one that took significantly longer, I'd had it longer.

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:25.280
 I'd had it probably for the best part of three years. And every summer I'd look at it and just

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:28.480
 be a little bit more concerned because it was just getting a little bigger and a little bit more

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.640
 scary and was very much activated by sunlight exposure.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.000
 Whereas the one on the other forearm, I'd just seen it last year.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.320
 So that one cleared up the quickest. That cleared up in about 35 days, 40 days.

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:44.800
 And the one on my other arm took about 65 days, I think it was.

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.440
 And you just put iodine on?

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.960
 Yeah, it's a 7% iodine. So you can get one...

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.080
 Are you talking about the gray kind of grainy?

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.280
 No, no, no. It's a liquid.

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:55.780
 It's...

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:57.040
 On your arm?

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:02.560
 Yeah, yeah. It was a raised kind of gray, white, pearly...

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:06.320
 I think I have one. I'm on my way to Rite Aid.

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.200
 And you said Curiderm?

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.080
 Curiderm, yeah.

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.520
 Does it end in an N or an M?

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:21.840
 M, as in derm. Your skin. Your dermal layer. Dermatitis. Dermatology.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.520
 Okay, yeah.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:28.560
 I want to thank you very much. I will try these things.

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.520
 Yeah. And I'll give out Dr. Peat's information at the end of the show,

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:35.200
 and you can go ahead and read his articles, which you'll find very interesting.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:41.520
 This has been so informative. It's the first time I've heard anything that even remotely.

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:46.000
 Well, there you go, Dr. Peat. You see, we've been doing this for 10 years now,

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.400
 and there's still people that probably never heard you.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:53.280
 I've only been here for a few years, and I don't always...

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:53.840
 Okay.

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:54.720
 Anyway, thank you.

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.240
 Yeah, you're welcome. You're welcome.

00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:02.080
 Okay. So, Dr. Peat, I was going to ask you what you would describe

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:05.920
 as an anti-inflammatory dietary lifestyle, but I mean, you've already mentioned it.

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:09.840
 Those things that you constantly...

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:14.640
 And I won't say constantly in a negative way, but you repeatedly highlight the fact that

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:19.360
 both aspirin, progesterone, thyroid, vitamin D, and calcium

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:24.880
 are important anti-inflammatory components of a healthy lifestyle.

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:31.440
 And other things that people often neglect are getting sunlight as much as possible

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:37.840
 and doing things that are fun. You've heard of the enriched environment,

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:42.960
 rat experiments that made their brains not only more intelligent, but also bigger.

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:50.800
 That kind of entertaining environment causes rats to produce more progesterone

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.960
 and to have lower estrogen.

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:59.440
 So just doing things that are fun and interesting,

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.760
 keep your hormones in the right direction.

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:06.000
 Yeah, it's another reminder for folks out there listening to this right now that

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.640
 that whole subject of which we have done several shows on environmental enrichment

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:15.280
 has been backed up by lots of animal studies that have shown categorically,

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:22.960
 you know, like the four swimming test and other tests of endurance that the rats

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:27.280
 that just know no escape just fail and die quickly, whereas the other rats

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:30.560
 that are given a bit of a chance, you know, they just, they make it.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:34.960
 And the whole thing about environmental enrichment, doing something you enjoy, folks,

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.040
 I mean, life's work, there's no doubt about it.

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:45.920
 I do a lot of work. So I'm totally up for some social and environmental enrichment.

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:50.080
 And I try to get it. I mean, sure, I have a garden and I like to walk to work.

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:52.400
 And I do get that. So I'm very lucky.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:57.760
 But I think people out there who perhaps feel entrapped by their jobs or entrapped

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:02.560
 by their situation need to get outside of themselves as much as they can.

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.880
 And even if it just means stepping outside the door and just looking up at the sky,

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:10.000
 you know, there's things like that that you can do.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.200
 Just give yourself a few moments and don't forget to breathe.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:17.600
 And it's an old Buddhist saying, don't forget to breathe.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:21.360
 But I think it's been such a busy state in our life these days,

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.200
 and it seems to be getting busier and busier.

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:25.600
 And Dr. Peat will attest to that.

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:32.080
 Speaking of breathing, I should mention that one of the main effects of taking thyroid

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:36.560
 or having a good thyroid function is producing carbon dioxide.

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.480
 So you don't want to over breathe.

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.720
 Right. Well, good on that note.

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.360
 Let's give give out your information.

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:52.080
 And I will quickly mention something that I feel led to talk about, which is a very strange guy.

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:54.960
 It seems to be doing the impossible.

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:58.880
 Wim Ho, you can check him out on the Internet.

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:03.920
 I would not advocate what he does or the reason by which he does what he does.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.400
 But over breathing is something he ascribes to,

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:10.640
 which is completely the opposite philosophy to Dr. Peat.

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:14.720
 But anyway, for those people that have listened tonight

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.440
 and for those people that have called in, thank you for your questions.

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:23.200
 Dr. Peat's website is raypeat.com.

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:30.400
 He's got at least 50, if not more, articles that are fully referenced on many different

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:36.800
 conditions, pathologies, states of mind, being well worth reading.

00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.240
 It's quite heavy.

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:42.800
 Some of it is very scientific, but he's also very approachable, too.

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:44.720
 I think he's still possibly approachable.

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.200
 I don't know where he gets the time from, but and we can also be reached

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:55.360
 1-888-WBM-ERB or on the Internet at westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.920
 I want to just say again, it's April 2019.

00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:03.200
 We will have an Instagram page dedicated to Dr. Peat's work from A to Z,

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.080
 and it will be from the horse's mouth.

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.640
 I won't add to it or take away.
