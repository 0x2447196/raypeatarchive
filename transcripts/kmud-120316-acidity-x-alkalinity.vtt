 The month from 7 to 8 p.m., we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with patients about a wide range of conditions

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 or which are sourced from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 to this month's subject of alkalinity versus acidity with reference to disease.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 or if you live outside the area, the toll free number is 1800 KMUD RAD.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 We can also be reached toll free on 1 888 WBMERB

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 for further questions during normal business hours Monday through Friday.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 So once again, we're very welcome to have Dr. Raymond Peat

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 share his wisdom and expertise with us for this next hour.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Dr. Peat, are you there?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Yes, hi.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Hi, thanks for joining us so much.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Okay, so would you as usual just give the listeners who perhaps have never heard you before

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 or heard of you a rundown of your academic and professional background?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 I studied biology at the University of Oregon

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 and have since about 1970 just continued on my own figuring things out

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 and talking to a lot of people and listening to their problems

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 and almost every time I talk to someone I learn something about physiology.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 It's a very complex continuing thing.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 You did a PhD in physiology, didn't you?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Based on hormones?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Yes, reproductive physiology and the aging was the subject of my dissertation.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Okay, because I know we've interviewed you quite a bit on the show now.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 I know we really enjoy having you here to share your experience

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 because you're so factual in terms of your scientific reference

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 for what most people will just spout out as being the truth.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 So that's something I very much appreciate with being able to have this opportunity

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 to talk to you and consult with you even.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 So it's always refreshing to have the science behind the reasons why.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 It just makes it a little bit more relevant.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 I think people are only too easily suckered into believing that something is the way it is

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 just because they've been told.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 So I really appreciate everything that you do to bring a scientific relevance to the subject.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 So this month, I know we've mentioned impartial cancer

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 and I know that your specialism with metabolism and thyroid hormone

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 and the other physiological hormones that are pro-life and not inflammatory

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 brings me to this topic of alkalinity and acidity.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 So generally summed up as pH.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 There's lots of information on the Internet

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 and I know that most people that are listening to the show now

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 that might be interested in the subject will appreciate the kind of clarity

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 with which you'll bring to the reason that you understand the importance of maintaining healthy pH.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 I think the main reference for cancer is that cancer seems to predominate in acidic environments

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 and that our diets for want of a better reason through the poor proteins

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 or other protein-based foods that we would eat, beans and seeds and some meats,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 produce about acidic byproducts.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 So how do you look at some?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 These sort of traditional ideas about the acid-base balance of food,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 they usually lead to a pretty good diet.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 For example, the Indian diet, fruit, vegetables, and milk and cheese,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 that's a good example of the alkaline residue diet.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 And so I don't have any disagreements with the dietary recommendations

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 to eat lots of milk and cheese and fruit and vegetables,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 but it's the small details that people use to argue for certain refinements of that diet.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 For example, the fear of milk.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 They talk about the loss of calcium in the urine as indicating that maybe it's too much acid,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 but actually the residue of milk is on the alkaline side because of the very large amount of potassium

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 and calcium in the milk, very similar to the vegetables that the cows eat to make the milk.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 They accumulate a huge amount of alkaline.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Let's just talk about that subject a little bit more, the residue, you've said.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 That's the, if you like, what's left behind once the food source has been metabolized.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 That's what actually dictates whether a food is what we call alkaline or acidic.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Yeah, and grains, nuts, beans, and meats do have a very acidic residue or ash after they're metabolized.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 And the biggest part of that in meat and nuts and grains is phosphate.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Proteins have a lot of sulfur, turns into sulfuric acid when it's metabolized.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 And those, it is possible to do biological harm by eating too much of those

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 and not enough of the potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium side.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Okay.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Which are predominantly found in fruits and vegetables.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Yeah, fruits, vegetables, milk, and cheese.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Okay, so would you be prepared to run through some of the more commonly experienced acidic production processes in the body,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 whether they're respiratory or in producing urine or other wastes,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 and how the body will deal with maintaining the pH balance in the body?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 I think it helps to look at the picture in the very biggest context,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 which is that mostly we're a huge lump of protein, and protein is on average acidic.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 And if you just leave acid sitting around in the environment, it will accumulate the base that neutralizes it.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 And so if we think of ourselves as a big piece of acidic protein,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 this just spontaneously will associate alkaline material with it, potassium, magnesium, for example,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 will neutralize the acidity of the protein.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 But as we energize our system by burning carbohydrates and fat mostly,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 the carbohydrate in particular turns into carbon dioxide,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 and the carbon dioxide has to constantly be leaving the organism.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 What comes in is oxygen. The oxygen combines with the fuel, carbon, and becomes carbon dioxide.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 So you have a neutral oxygen coming in, and it's called oxygen, meaning the acid former.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 The acid that it forms in this case is carbonic acid,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 and we're constantly metabolically producing this acid, which is streaming out of our cells

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 and leaving through our lungs primarily, the kidneys.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 We hardly lose any carbon dioxide or bicarbonate. It almost all leaves through the lungs.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 And as the carbon dioxide is produced, combining with water, it turns into carbonic acid, which ionizes.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 And so you have the acidic carbonic acid leaving the cell as a charged particle.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 It takes the oppositely charged sodium with it, primarily sodium and calcium,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 are constantly being drawn out of the cell by the stream of carbonic acid being produced inside the cell.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 So the alkaline minerals reach the bloodstream in balance with the carbonic acid,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 and then the carbonic acid leaves the lungs as carbon dioxide, leaving an alkaline trace in the blood.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 The cell basically was neutral until it produced the acid.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Then that neutralized protein gave up some of its mineral alkaline material,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 which then shows up in the blood.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 So the pH of the blood is above neutral, about pH 7.4.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Because of the carbonic acid?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 And in this healthy metabolite, well, the carbonic acid which left in your lungs,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 the mineral gets pulled out of the neutral cell, originally neutral.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 But as it's pulled out with the acid being constantly formed, the cell shows its basic protein acidity.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 And so the respiring cell is normally slightly on the acidic side.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 A good healthy cell with plenty of oxygen will be around pH 6.8.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 And if you stress a cell so it isn't getting enough carbon dioxide, or stress it in any way, radiation,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 not enough oxygen, not enough of any of the things that it needs,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 the cell becomes activated and shifts to the alkaline because it can't make carbon dioxide to acidify itself,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 and it begins producing lactic acid very inefficiently.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 And the thing about lactic acid is that the sugar, instead of being oxidized all the way to carbon dioxide,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 comes to the point of pyruvic acid.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 And instead of that being oxidized, the cell reduces the pyruvic acid to lactic acid

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 by taking some of the energy substance that was produced in this metabolism,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 wasting it to get rid of the electrons so that this NADH, NAD can go back and become reduced again

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 and produce more of the conversion of pyruvic to lactic acid.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 And in that process, the lactic acid is taking protons out of the cell

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 and is raising the pH of the cell as the conversion of pyruvic acid to lactic acid increases the pH of the cell,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 just the opposite of what the production of carbon dioxide was doing.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 So the stressed cell becomes alkaline.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 So when the popular theory is stated that cancer cells like an acidic environment,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 it sounds like if a cell is stressed, it likes an alkaline environment,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 then that sounds almost exactly opposite.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 Well, it shifts internally to become alkaline when it's stressed,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 but the produced lactic acid accumulates in its environment,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 and that's where the acid is in the surroundings, and then it shows up in the blood.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Right. So that's like if you've stressed your muscle out too much,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 then you're producing lactic acid, and that makes your muscle sore.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 Yeah.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 So that's a stressed cell. And does lactic acid play a big part in cancer as well?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Yeah. It not only acidifies the environment, which in itself could be actually protective

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 if it was acidified by carbon dioxide,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 but it happens that the lactic acid acts as a signal to do all of the things associated with cancer,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 such as stimulating the growth of new blood vessels so that the inflammation continues.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 It signals a lot of inflammatory changes, vasodilation, and the formation of new blood vessels

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 and the release of carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, lots of things producing free radicals and injury.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 So the lactic acid is functioning as a local poison or inflammatory agent.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 And the acidity that it produces is a sign that something is wrong,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 but it isn't the acidity in the tumor that's harmful because the tumor itself is internally alkaline.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 Right. So as a side point, what do you think of foods that are high in lactic acid?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 Well, even when we make it ourselves, it has these pro-inflammatory, swelling-producing, tumor-promoting functions.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 And when it's made by bacteria, it's somewhat more toxic.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 And when the body receives it, either from a stressed muscle or a tumor or from too much yogurt

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 or some food that has been fermented, it goes to the liver to get detoxified.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 So every time you eat something with lactic acid, it's the same as if you had been stressed physically.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Your liver has to work extra to detoxify it, and it has to have a source of energy to detoxify the lactic acid,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 turning it back into glucose. And the glucose is right back where you started.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 So you've lost ground every time your liver has to process lactic acid.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 So would you consider any amount of lactic acid-containing food to be a stress to the liver,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 or do you think there's some margin of benefit?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 A healthy liver doesn't notice an occasional dish of yogurt or sauerkraut or something.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 But how I got interested in it was a long time ago, I discovered kefir on some store.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Kefir?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 It tasted good, and so I drank a little more than a cup of it, I think, each day for lunch.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 But every time I did that, I would get a migraine-like headache every afternoon, and that started me looking up

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 what happens to your blood sugar and inflammatory mediators when you get more lactic acid than your liver likes.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 Interesting.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 How do you think about people's lifestyles promoting an acidic situation from stress,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 and how that would negatively impact someone's health in a scientific way?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 That's the reason why. How does stress...

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 The nervous system is in control of metabolism to a great extent, so you don't have to run five miles

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 to shift over into that stress metabolism if your nervous system and emotional systems are very stressed.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 Just the thought of what you're doing, I mentioned it before, that if you hang an animal by its tail

00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 or put it in a tube where it can't move, it will very quickly get an ulcer with lactic acid going to all of its systems,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 releasing histamine and other serotonin mediators of inflammation.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 But if you give something for the animal to bite, even though it's in the same restrained stressful situation,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 as long as it can defend itself by biting back, it doesn't get the ulcer.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 Do you think this could possibly explain why, as people have said in the past,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 people that are angry, as long as they let it out, they generally don't get cancer.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 The people that are angry that hold it in and don't do anything about it, they get cancer.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 The rat experiment really suggests that.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Okay. So do you think that if we can coin the term in the acidic lifestyle,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 the stressed businessman who's always trying to meet deadlines, that he's hard pushed to make,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 just missing the plane or just missing his appointments and being very stressed out,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 that's a potential for a situation where cancer could arise because of the acidity from stress?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 Well, it's actually the things like lactic acid and serotonin.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 And the stress really is doing its damage by creating an intracellular alkaline condition.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 It's the alkalinity.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 So when someone is under surgery, they often get ulcers just from being operated on somewhere else.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 And if they are respirating them, that stress will very often give them lung inflammation

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 and brain inflammation and so on.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 And they've found gradually, 60 or 70 years after the people originally discovered it,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 they've found that if they don't ventilate them very thoroughly

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 and let them accumulate quite a bit of carbon dioxide, their lungs and brain are protected and don't swell.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 So the acidity from carbon dioxide is extremely anti-stress and protective.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 It's the alkalinity that goes with producing lactic acid which does the harm.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Right. I think just to explain that, you're saying that the acidity is produced by the production of hydrogen ions,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 say, that are in the extracellular medium from the cell.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 So the cell is alkaline.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Yeah, it just shifts the protons out of the cell.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 So that's why people get stomach ulcers if they're stressed because instead of their cells in their stomach holding onto the acid,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 it's like releasing it into the environment and then it damages the stomach lining.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 Can you look at it like that?

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Yeah, it's really the serotonin and other inflammatory things in the stomach rather than just the acid.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 The stomach is very good at holding extreme acidity safely.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 But when stress gives the wrong kind of signals and you don't have continuing respiration, then you get the damage.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 So it's the presence of that acid in a stress cell that's then triggering the inflammatory mediators.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 You can't actually just measure it because everyone's stomach is acidic.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 It's the most acidic environment ever.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 I mean, they say when you have stomach ulcers, you shouldn't have this acidic food,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 but it's not really down to the acid that you're saying.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 It's more down just to the other inflammatory mediators.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 You're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMU DeGarboville 91.1 FM from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 You're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of alkalinity versus acidity

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 in reference to certain disease processes.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Dr. Raymond Peat is joining us in the studio.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 And until 8 o'clock, if people would like to call in with any questions related or unrelated, please go ahead.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 OK, so Dr. Peat, how realistic is it?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 I mean, because there's a thing that they call the potential renal acid load of a food, right, the P-R-A-L,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 that I guess is the measure of how much ammonia or protons are within the food when it's metabolized,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 and that's the kind of ash value, as it were, of the food.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 How realistic do you think it is to consume alkalizing materials

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 and how that would affect the overall acid-base balance when the stomach is so acidic?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 Well, I think it's very safe to consume a great excess of the alkaline material,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 which the fruit and vegetable and milk people do.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 And the body can produce -- can change protein, for example, into ammonium.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 And if it doesn't have enough mineral, it will waste protein, turning it into the equivalent of the alkaline material

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 and using the ammonia as the cation equivalent of the sodium, so it can save the sodium and calcium and so on.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 Okay, because I always looked at ammonia as the NH4+ as being able to dissociate into hydrogen protons,

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 but I probably missed the point of somewhere along the line.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 I always look at ammonia as -- I know ammonia is a base, it's not an acid, but I think I got it messed up in chemistry.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 When it becomes the ammonium, that is the equivalent of sodium.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 Right, that's the NH4+, right?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 Yeah.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Okay.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 All right, so how realistic do you think it is to consume?

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 Do you think that consuming things that have an excess of potassium and magnesium and calcium

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 can actively work to raise the pH of someone's environment?

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 Well, I think they have -- the main function is sparing protein that you would use for the kidneys to help to regulate the minerals.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 And, for example, when a person is fasting for several days, they will generally lose more protein than fat

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 because the stress hormones rise and they live on a pure meat diet when they're fasting as their tissues break down.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 Right. Okay.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 So if you drink that fast, if you just drink the minerals, salt water, baking soda, potassium, magnesium and calcium,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 any of the alkaline minerals will radically spare the amount of protein that you would be consuming and wasting.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 So a fast is much less stressful and harmful if you're getting the alkaline minerals.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 Okay. I know that you've mentioned sodium bicarbonate as being -- there's a caller.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Yeah, okay, we have a caller on the air, but I think we better take this caller first.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Hello, you're on the air?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Yes. This is fascinating, and thank you very much, yourselves and Dr. Peet.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 Is the carbon dioxide circulation or exchange that the doctor just spoke of,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 is that why it's so calming to re-breathe carbon dioxide when you're in stress?

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 Because stress, that's really a primary thing that stress does, shifting to the alkaline and making lactic acid.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 The cells are in danger of getting into a chronically activated state.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 The panic attack is a typical thing where the body too easily shifts over into making lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 And so the person feels that they're suffocating, but in the long run,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 that same thing can lead to degenerative diseases or cancer in which the cells are stuck in a panic attack condition.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 And if you think of the original state of the cell as being the protein acid which attracts the minerals to neutralize the acid,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 you can restore that condition with carbon dioxide, just re-breathing it,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 getting your percentage of the acidic carbon dioxide dissolved in the blood up where it should be.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 You can stop the production of lactic acid, reverse these stress processes,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 and restore the cell to its relaxed, unpanicked condition.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 And that's through like bad breathing?

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Yeah, and for example, you can generally lower your blood pressure just breathing a minute or two in a paper bag a few times a day.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 I've seen people take their blood pressure down 30 points in just a day or two that way.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 Thank you so much.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 So it really is a de-stressor not only for the mental state, but for all the other cellular states that are panicking.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Yeah.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 Every cell or tissue that you look at, it's protected if you restore the proper amount of carbon dioxide.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 And the carbon dioxide in the gaseous form, it's easier if you think about the pH, acid-base balance of the organism,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 if you think of it as being pushed by a few factors, one of which is the amount of dissolved or gaseous carbon dioxide.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 So that breathing in a bag is one of the most powerful ways to restore the proper balance.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 If you need more bicarbonate, the gaseous carbon dioxide will allow you to make more bicarbonate.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 And that will help you regulate your minerals and even help you retain more of your alkaline minerals.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 So it will help correct your balance either in the acid or base direction.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 Taking a sodium bicarbonate, for example, will actually acidify cells that are in need of more carbon dioxide

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 because when the bicarbonate has been deficient, when a cell is exposed to the bicarbonate,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 it will convert it into the acidic carbon dioxide and be able to lower its pH, even though you've taken the alkaline baking soda.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 So is that why you recommend baking soda for athletes, to help lower their... does that help balance out that high lactic acid?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 Yeah. There have been experiments, for example, in the marathon or bicycle races in Death Valley where the altitude is very low.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 They found that I think it was a tablespoon of baking soda at the start of the race made them tolerate the stress much better.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 All right. Good. There's another caller on the line, so let's take the next caller.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 Hi. My question involves a study I heard just recently on, I think, NPR about the cultures, the Western civilizations,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 that the mortality rate for Japan, and they're the highest smoking population of all Western cultures,

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 is actually much higher than here in America.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 I'm wondering, does smoking increase that carbon dioxide that you're talking about in the body to release, to relax it?

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 I'll take my answer off the air. Thanks.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Could you rephrase the question? What was higher in the other cultures?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 He said smoking, and I think he was trying to get at, was smoking an efficient way of raising your CO2, but it's monoxide, I think.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 The carbon monoxide is something that we produce under stress, and it lowers our ability to use oxygen and to produce carbon dioxide.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 Carbon monoxide is what you inhale as part of the cigarette smoking, right? It increases your carbon monoxide, no?

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 Yeah.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 Okay, so the caller that called in the carbon monoxide from smoking is pretty damaging,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 and it's not something that would improve your CO2 content.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 I think Michael has a question.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 Do you have any thoughts as to why the Japanese culture has such longevity compared to, or lower mortality,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 especially since they do consume a lot of tobacco?

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 Much of that is propaganda.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 When you look at the actual details of the population, it isn't as great as some of the articles have been saying.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 For example, one of the articles, if you look at the mortality figures, it suggests that the average lifespan is 300 years.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 If you don't look at the whole structure of the population, it's hard to get an idea of what the real age-specific death rate is.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 You have to look at how likely a person is to die when they're 60 or 70 or 80 or 90 years old,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 rather than looking at the mortality per population.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 That's the trouble with the United States since the turn of the century.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 They stopped publishing the actual raw figures, the given age-adjusted mortality rate.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 I don't think anyone outside of the Bureau of Statistics really is sure what the longevity of Americans is doing right now.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 Back to what that call-out question was, you don't think that smoking raises carbon dioxide in any way?

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 It does, but it raises the carbon monoxide so seriously that that's the main effect and it's harmful.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 Right.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 Okay, so you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMUD 91.1 FM.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 Until 8 o'clock, rather, from now until 8 o'clock, people are invited to call in.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 Dr. Raymond Peat is here joining us in the studio.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 If you live outside the area, it's 1-800-KMUD-RAD, or if you're lucky enough to live in this area, code is 923-3911.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, you mentioned the sodium bicarbonate for the athletes in Death Valley

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 would actually give them a greater interval between getting stressed.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 The potassium bicarbonate, is that something that could be used similarly as sodium bicarbonate?

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 Yeah, the average person is very good at getting rid of the sodium,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 and so the sodium bicarbonate is something that most people can use without experiencing edema or disturbance of blood pressure.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 But the potassium bicarbonate, it has a relaxing effect on your blood vessels,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 and so it can help to lower your blood pressure even more than the sodium bicarbonate,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 but you have to be cautious because too much of it can relax your heart.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 And just for our listeners, in case people don't know what sodium bicarbonate is, it's baking soda.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 I'm just making sure we've mentioned that. I'm not sure if we have.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 If we have, I'm sorry to repeat that, but sodium bicarbonate is baking soda.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 Okay, so what would your suggestions be, Dr. Peat, for the people that are out there

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 that have been thinking about acid and alkalinity and cancer problems with maybe an acidic situation?

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 What would be an ideal lifestyle that you would suggest?

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 Well, the only foods I would suggest eliminating would be the grains and beans and most of the nuts,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 and probably reducing most meats. Gelatin happens to be the part of the meat that doesn't have so many

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 of the disturbing acidic pro-inflammatory effects.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 And in the news currently is the pink slime issue, which is made from connective tissues,

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 but it seems to me that that might be the best part of the meat.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 Okay, we do have another caller on the air, so let's take this next caller. You're on the air.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 Hi, thanks for taking my call.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Whenever I do rather short walks, like half an hour, I get muscle soreness for a couple of days afterwards.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 So I'm assuming I'm making too much lactic acid somehow.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 So I started taking baking soda baths, and I wondered if taking these baths with about two pounds

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 of baking soda per day is safe.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 Dr. Peet, did you hear that?

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 Yeah, I think it's good. Salt, magnesium sulfate, epsom salts, and baking soda are all good.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 The baking soda helps you absorb magnesium if you have epsom salts mixed with it.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 So that's a good combo, like maybe one pound baking soda and one pound epsom salts?

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 Yeah, and some experimenters in naturally carbonated mineral springs found that people were absorbing carbon dioxide

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 through their skin. Even though their body contains a lot of carbon dioxide, the body has such an affinity for it

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 that it will soak it up from the mineral water against the gradient. It's as if we had pumps in our skin.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 Because it's going from a high concentration, I mean a low concentration, to a high concentration.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 Yeah, it's a matter of solubility. The enzymes turn from the bicarbonate into the gaseous carbon dioxide

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 form which dissolves in our fats and cells.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 I can't actually remember the person that was talking about this, but it was in relation to a cancer treatment.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 They were purporting the use of ascorbate at the rate of up to 130 grams a day.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 It was 9 parts ascorbate and 1 part ascorbic acid. It was supposedly keeping certain types of cancer from growing

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 and actually causing some to regress. Do you know much about that?

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 Because it's vitamin C, but I understand the processing for these things is less than desirable.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 Yeah, they keep changing the technology. I don't know exactly what they're doing now,

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 but as recently as about 10 years ago, a free radical chemist dissolved a gram of pure powdered ascorbic acid

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 in a liter of distilled water and found that there were enough heavy metals in that purified vitamin C

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 to produce as many free radicals as a killing dose of x-rays would have produced.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 Oh my goodness. So it's citrus season. That's a great source of vitamin C.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 Yeah, all of our foods except grains and beans basically are very good sources of vitamin C.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 The analytic methods have generally ignored it in meat and some of the solid foods like that,

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 but it's present in meats at a very high concentration in the oxidized state.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 All you have to do is metabolize and you turn the oxidized ascorbic acid into the common ascorbic acid.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 So is that the theory why a concentrated orange juice still has absorbable vitamin C?

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 It's just a slightly changed form when you boil?

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 Yeah, and most of the tests don't really look at the molecule.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 They just look at the reducing power, and in some vegetables and meats, for example,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 the tissue has oxidized it partly into dehydroascorbic acid, but as soon as you eat it,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 it turns back into ordinary ascorbic acid.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 Well, they say in Britain it was the fish and chips that prevented the British people from developing scurvy

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 because potatoes have quite a lot of vitamin C in them as well, don't they?

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 Yeah, and fish.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 And fish, right, and the fish.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 All right, so how about, would you be to clarify a little what the people out there with,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 unfortunately dealing with cancers who are reading things like, you know,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 the problems with acidic states in the body and kind of getting confused about how exactly to do anything about it,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 what would be the best way of maintaining enough energy in the body to deal with it, really,

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 I think in terms of not only making things acid, but not making...

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 The so-called alkaline ash diet, lots of fruits and vegetables, milk and cheese,

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 all of those are things that will help to let the stressed cancer cell repair itself as far as it can.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 And things like breathing in a paper bag to increase the carbon dioxide are probably helpful.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 As long ago as 1910, the insurance companies knew that people who lived at very high altitudes

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 had a very low cancer mortality.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 And that has been tested experimentally 50 years ago, taking implanting tumors in rats

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 and leaving them near sea level, all of them quickly died, taking them up to 17,000 feet altitude,

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 half of them threw off the cancers and had no symptoms left.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 Just from the carbon dioxide retention when the oxygen retention was lowered.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 The carbon dioxide, one of its basic functions is to assure the delivery of oxygen to the tissues.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 So, heavy breathing, hyperventilating is a way to lower the oxygen in your tissues

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 because you blow out the carbon dioxide and you need a lot of carbon dioxide in your tissue

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 to deliver the oxygen, open up the blood vessels and let the oxygen circulate and be used.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 Okay. A little digression perhaps, but it's on a kind of anti-cancer path.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 What do you think about Gerson therapy and what he was putting forward as a diet for anti-cancer?

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 I happened to get a copy of his book just a few years after he died in the mid or early 1960s.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 And I read it and was very impressed by his detailed studies.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 I seem to have read just about everything about cancer in the first half of the 20th century.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 And so I tried to figure out how it was working and the minerals are a very important part of it.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 And restoring the oxidative metabolism, he regularly gave his people armor thyroid.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 I think two grains was a very common dose for his patients.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 Okay. I have a question about thyroid.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 If you say you took thyroxine and you took armor thyroid and you were suddenly without the ability to get armor thyroid,

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 how much of a mammal's thyroid would you need to eat in order to get the dose you needed?

00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 The armor product was standardized to imitate the fresh glandular weight.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 And so they would powder, defat the gland and powder it and then dilute it with glucose or lactic acid

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 or something to increase the weight and volume until it was similar to the fresh piece of gland before dehydration.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 And so they called that the normal dilution.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 And the powder itself was called the 3X concentrate,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 meaning that the gland is three times more concentrated than the old armor thyroid pills.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 And that means that one gram of the gland is equal to 15 grains of armor thyroid.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 So one gram of the fresh gland is equal to 15 grains of the armor thyroid.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 Yeah.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 Okay. We have another call on the line.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 Go ahead. You're on the air.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 Hi. I always enjoy the program.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 This is Jeff Frider on the Mendocino Coast.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 And my question may sound flip, but Dr. Peet, I always listen to what you say

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 and try to put together what you're saying in a question that I really am intrigued by.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 So I'll put it in these terms.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 What would a double latte espresso, pink slime milkshake with baking soda, a tablespoon on the side,

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 do for an athlete's performance in the Death Valley race?

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 Would it enhance their performance or would it give deeper meaning to Death Valley?

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 It would need a lot of ice, I think.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 The caffeine tends to enhance performance in mysterious ways that no one has really figured out how it works.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 But the gelatin has an antistress effect.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 That mixture seems like it would be pretty good, the baking soda, gelatin content.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 And you would need quite a bit of sugar with it, preferably fructose.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 That actually brings up another question I have for you, Dr. Peet.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 I know we've had several programs again, but I think the people that may have just tuned in and listened

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 have read that the cancers feed on sugar and you've got to starve a cancer from sugar.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 Actually, they feed on amino acids and turn the amino acids into sugar and then turn some of the sugar back into fat

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
 and then they metabolize the fat.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 And with all that silly chemistry, they produce a lot of heat with no light or no function to speak of.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 That's why you can identify a cancer, because it's so hot, because it's burning protein,

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 turning it into amino acids and then into sugar and then into fat.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 So is that why thermography is quite an accurate way at looking for cancers in the body?

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 Yeah.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 So if you can feed it as much sugar as it wants, then it won't eat your protein, at least not so fast.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 Okay.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 So it could prevent the wasting disease associated with cancer then.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 Yeah, and saturated fats aren't probably as good as sugar for quieting stress tissues,

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 but they do have specific anti-stress functions.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 So I would recommend avoiding all of the polyunsaturated fats, because those turn on the stress reactions,

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 increase your adrenal corticoids, adrenaline, pituitary hormones, and so on,

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 and while the saturated fats inhibit those same stress systems.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:16.000
 So just for our listeners, in case you're not aware of what the PUFA or the polyunsaturated fat is,

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 it's the liquid vegetable oils not including olive oil.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 So everything but olive oil and coconut oil is the saturated fat that's very, very useful,

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 as well as beef and lamb fat if it was from an organic animal, and butter, of course, butter and cream.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000
 Okay.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 I have another quick question for you.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 I think there's going to be another caller here who's being attended to, but going back to the Gerson diet,

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 you mentioned one of the things that I've looked at and it kind of caught my attention,

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 because I know you've always been a great advocate of consuming liver from a vitamin point of view.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 What was with the injected liver extracts?

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 Oh, that was a way to get all of the essential nutrients.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 Right, okay.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 And around the time I read his book, I had been -- I met Leonel Strong,

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 who developed the cancer-prone strains of mice, who developed spontaneous breast cancer,

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:28.000
 and he had been curing cancer just with an extract of liver.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 And that was my first research project was using to try to find out what it was in the liver that,

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 in these liver extracts, could cure cancer.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 But he also wanted to eliminate salt from a diet, too,

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 and that's a little bit of a strange one for me to get my head around,

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 because I know you're, again, an advocate of salt as actually a very good product,

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 rather than what modern dietary trends would have us think otherwise.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 Another person who studied cancer at the very basic level was Frederick Coke, William Frederick Coke.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 He, in working on the parathyroid hormone before he did his famous cancer preparations,

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 he found that the alkaline minerals, to a tremendous extent, would substitute for each other.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 So you could, for example, cure -- you can take out the parathyroid glands,

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 which cause a calcium problem, but you could cure that with sodium or potassium or magnesium.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 So the salt could replace the calcium or the potassium or the magnesium.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 Yeah.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 To a great extent, any of those alkaline minerals can replace the others.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 You don't have to worry about the balance so much, because having an excess, your body can sort them out.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 Well, that's a good fail-safe mechanism of the body.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 I think we have another caller on the line.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 And first I have a brief question for someone, because it's simple.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 Can you simulate being at high altitude by eating a lot of baking soda?

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 Yeah, that's what the racers, bicycle racers, were doing.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 In Death Valley?

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
 Yeah.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 When someone who lives at a high altitude goes to sea level, they very often get sick.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 And vice versa.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 Oxygen poisoning is really worse than deprivation.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 You recover quicker.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000
 We do have one more caller for you, Dr. Peet, so let's get this caller in.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000
 Because we only have five minutes left before the end of the show.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 You're on the air.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 Hi. I'm wondering, is this diet stuff you're talking about specifically for people with cancer,

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 or can regular people adjust their diet?

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 I'm vegan, and I'm looking for different sources of protein.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 Well, potatoes are the best vegetable protein known.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 They're better than eggs in terms of quality.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 What's the best protein?

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 Potatoes.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 Potatoes.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 Potatoes are actually -- they have --

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 more than 6% of the protein quality ranked next to egg yolk.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 Right.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 So eight ounces -- I think eight ounces of potato has eight grams of protein.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 Oh, wow.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 I had no idea.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 I thought it was a carb.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 When you're eating the starch, too, a liter of potato is like a liter of milk on average.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:50.000
 Yeah, if you make potato juice and don't drink the starch that settles out.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 If you make potato juice, then it's more like eating pure egg yolk.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:03.000
 And you can even make a scrambled egg-like preparation from potato juice, and it's quite tasty.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 Wow.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 And this would be healthy for the general public or for only people with cancer?

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 Well, I've seen that for people with mysterious ailments who seem to be dying,

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 and they have one or two meals and they just popped out of it.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 No one really knew what was wrong with them, but I've seen it happen.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 Okay, so what about the raw potato juice?

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
 You'd recommend cooking it, right, Dr. --

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 Yeah, I think there's someone who is now testing the raw stuff,

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.000
 and he's going to tell me whether it made him sick.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000
 My experience is with cooking it, like scrambling an egg.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000
 Let the starch settle out before you cook it.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 We are wrapping up.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
 We have three minutes left before the end of the show.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000
 Thank you very much.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 You're very welcome.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 Thank you for tuning in.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 Okay, let's leave it there, and let's let people know where and how to contact Dr. Peet.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 So for those people that have heard this evening's show, maybe for the first time

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 or have heard Dr. Peet on the radio before, just a reminder,

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 his website is www.raypeet.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 Lots of scholarly articles there written by Dr. Peet, fully referenced.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000
 And as far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong, he is open to being e-mailed.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.000
 Is that right?

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
 Yeah, good.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000
 Okay, so there's the word from the doctor himself.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:37.000
 Okay, so for all of those people who have contributed by asking questions

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000
 and being part of the show, thank you so much.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 We can be reached for further questions on 707-986-9506 or toll free.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
 On 1-888-WBM-ERB.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000
 Yeah, so take a look at Dr. Peet's website.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 It's very useful information.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 It's not what you're going to find in mainstream,

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 and if you do find some of it in mainstream,

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.000
 you'll probably find it confused with some other erroneous information.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 So go to Dr. Peet's website, and you can be guaranteed that he's done all the research for you.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:16.000
 Thank you for joining us, Dr. Peet, and thank you for all those callers.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000
 Have a good night and see you in April.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:28.000
