00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240
 Well, welcome to this 2019, January, the 18th, 2019 edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.560
 As usual, the third Friday of every month is given to the show, which is a one-hour live call-in

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.000
 from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock. And this month's topic is going to be just

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.840
 wrapping up the last two discourses from December and November on skin cancer. But to tie in the

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:42.800
 topic of oncogenes with viruses and epigenetics with the viricidal activity of selected medicinal

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.800
 plants, there's lots of research. And whilst I know there has to be a little bit of reservation

00:00:50.800 --> 00:01:00.800
 and careful reading around the subject, there's a wealth of new articles being published on PubMed

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:09.280
 and other "scientific peer-reviewed sites", ResearchGate and quite a few others. I've got

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:18.320
 lots of 2018 and some even from this month, January 2019, research being done either on

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.520
 new subjects around viricidal components or bringing up old material with a new spin,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.160
 as we'll see with camphor and some of its imine derivatives. The number here, if you live in the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:41.360
 area or if in fact, if you live in Iceland or anywhere else on the planet, is 707-923-3911.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.760
 We'd love to hear from you from 7.30 until the end of the show. For those people, especially,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.880
 who have experience with Dr. Peat, following his protocols, seeing the benefits, Dr. Peat,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.120
 again, thank you so much for joining us this month. For those people who perhaps haven't heard

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.480
 of you and don't know too much about you, I will just give a rundown of your academic and professional

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:15.760
 background before we get started. Okay. Graduate study in biology for a PhD, 1968-72, University

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:27.040
 of Oregon. And since then, following up on some of the ideas that I worked on for my dissertation,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:37.520
 aging and cell energy production, basically. And among other things, that includes how hormones

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:46.960
 and foods promote viral immunity. Okay, good. I'll just qualify what you briefly touched on there.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.120
 You're a big advocate of, well, let's call it natural medicine anyway, but a big advocate of

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.640
 food-based help in terms of helping the organism to recover their homeostasis, their balance,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.240
 to fight infection, etc., whether it's producing natural steroids or fighting bacteria and viruses.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.760
 So you're a big advocate of good food. And essentially in that, I think when I first

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.400
 discovered you, you were the person who pretty much set me straight with fish oils and liquid

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.880
 oils as being good for you, that actually being very destructive. So you'd spend a lot of time

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:35.840
 discussing the nutrition aspects of healing, don't you? And the immune system ideas go way back

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:44.240
 before I went to graduate school in biology. I had read some of William F. Koch's research,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:55.840
 and some of his colleagues found that the treatments he used for curing cancer also

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:05.520
 worked for curing animal diseases such as mastitis in cows. And he showed that the healthy cow could

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:15.600
 actually have more bacteria in its udder than the sick cow with mastitis, and that a healthy cow

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:24.720
 tolerated microorganisms without suffering damage from them. And that was what led me to get

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:36.960
 interested in the newer research. Jamie Cunliffe in England has what he calls the damage theory of

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:48.240
 immunity in which the immune system really is a system for repairing tissue damage. And if

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:56.800
 microorganisms cause damage, then the immune system so-called will clear out the microorganisms

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.960
 that cause the damage. But that's a side effect of repairing the damage. Pauli Matsinger

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:11.440
 about the same time came out with the danger hypothesis. And that's very similar, except

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:26.000
 it isn't really as realistic as Jamie Cunliffe's, because it still leaves it open for seeing the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.560
 microorganism as intrinsically dangerous. I think the facts indicate that we can tolerate

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.280
 microorganisms as long as they don't poison us. Right, or if indeed we're not poisoned by the

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:49.200
 environment in which we live. Yeah. I mean, it's a very grand idea. And I think for some people,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.880
 they are successful in putting it into practice. I think, speaking from personal experience,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:04.640
 in terms of having been helped by you and guided and put straight about things that I thought were

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:13.840
 true when I was studying herbal medicine in England back in 1993. It's like I said, a grand

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:21.680
 idea to have that common route that the body is intrinsically able to heal itself if you give it

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.280
 the right material. And I don't necessarily mean the drugs, whatever it is that pharmaceutical

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.520
 companies produce to treat quote unquote, the illness, but that the body has got a fairly

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.240
 good, it's got an incredibly miraculous way of running per se. And then it has a pretty good

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:48.080
 way of dealing with organisms and threats to its own homeostasis, which will hopefully we get into

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:55.920
 here fairly soon. When you look at a viral disease epidemic, there are always people who don't

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:02.560
 succumb to it. And you often find that they have contracted the infection, they have antibodies

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.560
 to it, but it didn't make them at all sick, or just slightly sick. Yeah. Okay, I just wanted to

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.720
 remind myself here, when you started talking about, you know, the organism and, you know,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.360
 the cows with the higher loads of bacteria that were actually fairly, you know, safe and

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.680
 non susceptible. That makes me think of the theory of terrain that I read research that I was doing

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.800
 my dissertation on the essential oils of the labiae, the mint family when I was studying

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.440
 my degree in herbal medicine. And there was a couple of French scientists who developed this

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.920
 theory of the terroir, or the terrain of the organism being exactly what you're saying,

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:50.400
 the key pivotal moment around which disease will or won't affect the organism and how

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:56.800
 the terrain could be subtly changed with essential oils. And I got to learn about the isoprenoids

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:03.120
 and the terpenes and all of the other volatile smells that we get from the mint family. And I

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.120
 hopefully later on, I will touch on some of those medicinal herbs that have had some fairly recent

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:16.000
 documentation as being viricidal. And again, I got to make it kind of make it plain that people

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.240
 need to do their own research. Because when I bought articles to your attention and say,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.440
 well, hey, how about this? You've said, well, actually, that's not because of this,

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:29.520
 it's because of this. And I think we'll maybe talk about that a little bit concerning

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.560
 mevalonate and statins and how this whole, it was supposedly a good thing. But let me

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.000
 kind of first start by just clearing up a few questions from the last month about

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.800
 melanoma. We talked about skin cancers, whether it's basal cell or squamous cell and,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.480
 or actinic keratosis, or whatever they want to classify them at. But apparently, the incidence

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:57.280
 of melanoma has been on the rise exponentially since the 80s. I think from before that,

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:04.320
 I've seen that it has increased 500% since about 1940. Okay, what do you think about that? Do you

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:11.360
 reasons for that? I'm pretty sure it's not sun exposure, because it has an inverse

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:22.000
 relation with altitude. And the change that I think is relevant is the polyunsaturated fats

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.560
 in the diet, which have increased just about at the same rate that melanoma has.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:32.560
 Are you thinking it's because the polyunsaturates are energy depleting and or producing lipid

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:41.040
 fish skin and the skin or your many of those things? Yeah, the energy goes down and inflammation

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:50.000
 goes up. In the veteran study, supposedly, to prevent heart disease in the 1960s, they gave

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.440
 corn oil based diet to one group and regular fats, including margarine and butter and ordinary,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:07.040
 moderately unsaturated fats. And the one group that got corn oil in their diet regularly,

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:13.120
 at the end of eight years, had three times the mortality from cancer.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:22.720
 So, one of the industry's own studies related to what you see in the animal studies that,

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.240
 for example, if you look at just linoleic acid, which was the original

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:37.200
 essential fatty acid, so called, as the proportion of linoleic acid in the diet goes up, the

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:43.520
 cancer incidence mortality goes up right with in proportion to linoleic acid.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.640
 Okay, these are just because the pro-inflammatory nature

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:55.760
 of this in people's diets and in the food chain in general. And they do interfere with

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:01.040
 production and use of cholesterol. Right. Okay, good. I'm glad you mentioned that,

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:08.160
 because we will touch on that again a little bit later. Okay, so I was looking at an article that

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.800
 his headline was the following, I just wanted you to say, if you can comment on this, that

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:19.840
 the lung cancer incidence decreases with elevation, quote unquote, evidence for oxygen as an inhaled

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:27.360
 carcinogen. So, oxygen at sea level versus altitude and what you've always mentioned about

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.920
 CO2 being protective with longevity definitely increasing with elevation.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:40.800
 The insurance companies have known for more than 100 years that cancer mortality in general

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:49.760
 decreases with altitude, very low and high altitude cities. And as the oxygen pressure

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:57.680
 in the air increases, the carbon dioxide tends to decrease. If they are competitive,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:05.120
 the pressure of oxygen displaces the carbon dioxide bound to blood.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.720
 So this is at sea level. So people at sea level are much more likely,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.720
 perhaps statistically, than to get cancer because they don't have the protective effect of CO2 that

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.520
 you'd get at altitude. Yeah, it's an anti-inflammatory protective factor.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.920
 Okay, good. All right. Well, you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMUD Gov. Bill

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:31.360
 91.1 FM from 7.30 till the end of the show. We'd love to take calls related or hopefully not too

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.000
 unrelated to this subject of skin cancer, oncogenes, and then hopefully in a bit here, we'll

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.360
 get into some viricidal activity of medicinal plants and ask Dr. Peat his opinion of the

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:48.080
 structures because I know he's got a few favorites, especially those things that have dark pigments

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:53.120
 and/or the dark red color, the free radical quenching things like palyarcho. But anyway,

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:58.960
 the number here, if you're in the area or even if you're not, is 707-923-3911.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:08.240
 So I just wanted again to just quickly cover what I found is very disparate information on the one

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.400
 hand. This is all from either looking at PubMed articles or ResearchGate articles. And again,

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:20.880
 you can definitely offer your impression of those. And I know that you've got a lot of history with

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.280
 bad research being uncovered and you're finding information that's completely contrary

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:30.720
 and/or just downright stupid being published. I don't know how it happens, but it happens. It

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.840
 gets into print and people read it and then you've got to spend a time unlearning a lot of things

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.920
 that you thought were the way you've been told they were. But statins, I know you're completely

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:48.400
 against statins and actually you've got a very different base level at which someone's cholesterol

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:55.040
 will be termed by you healthy. I know the medical association start looking at interfering with

00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:00.080
 people's cholesterol levels when they get up to 200 or so milligram percent. And you've always

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:07.360
 said that the elderly or even people over 50, not that elderly, but people over the age of 50

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:17.760
 want a cholesterol level of 200 or 220 to 230. So in terms of what statins do, I saw from their

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:25.280
 pharmacology that they block mevalonate or they can interfere with mevalonate and it's a kind of

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:33.840
 upstream chemical. And this can cause aneuploidy and this in its own right is really quite a serious

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:43.600
 outcome for using statins. So if you experimentally starve cells for cholesterol,

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:53.520
 the same thing that statins does to the person, the cells in vitro are stuck in the tetraploid

00:14:53.520 --> 00:15:04.400
 state. They can't do the reductive separation of chromosomes and old people's skin is

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:14.080
 relatively loaded with cells stuck in that state because with aging, the cells lose their ability

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.520
 to maintain the production of cholesterol. And when they get stuck in that condition,

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:26.000
 then if something forces them to divide, they get the number of chromosomes

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.480
 sort of randomized as they divide and that can produce cancer cells.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:43.520
 Do you see any protocol or do you have any kind of answers in terms of rejuvenating skin cholesterol?

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:51.440
 Experimentally and in the cosmetic industry, they're starting to put cholesterol in cosmetics

00:15:51.440 --> 00:16:00.240
 because it in effect does rejuvenate the cells. It restores their ability to divide healthfully.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.880
 So you can physically topically apply cholesterol in the form of anointment or cream to the skin

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.880
 and expect the skin to take up a reasonable portion of that?

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.920
 That's what the experiments show and the cosmetics companies are taking advantage of it.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.840
 Interesting. Okay, because that was the whole thing that you mentioned about vitamin D production in

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:23.440
 the elderly. You have to have twice as much or more sunlight exposure to get the same conversion

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:29.440
 from cholesterol to vitamin D, which is so important for immune health and immune suppression,

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.520
 immune surveillance. There's half as much cholesterol in the old skin as...

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:42.400
 Half as much. Okay, so that's a potential to look out for then. And I think from an anti-aging

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:49.120
 perspective of... I know the collagen is the issue, well, it's some of the issue in people's skin when

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.440
 they get older, when it starts to look a little unsightly or wrinkly or saggy or whatever, however

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:59.120
 they'd want to describe it. Do you think there's much that can be done to restore the collagen or

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:06.560
 the scaffold in which the skin is normally elastic and stretchy? Yeah, the cells normally are able to

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:15.840
 turn it over. Energized cells can eat up the hardened, crystalline, aged collagen and let the

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:26.320
 cells produce fresh collagen. And the cholesterol lets the cells divide normally and so they are

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:35.680
 more energetic, produce a thicker layer of healthy cells rather than a scaly, hardened layer of

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:42.720
 aged, flaky cells. Okay, so there does seem to be then, from what you're saying, research showing

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:49.200
 that that is beneficial, that if people want to think a little bit along those lines down the road,

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:56.400
 they could probably do something themselves in terms of acquiring cholesterol and, again,

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:02.560
 because it's very... it's amphoteric and it's moiety, isn't it? There's a hydrophilic

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:12.640
 head, is it, and a hydrophobic tail? It's one or the other. Yeah, the practical way to keep your

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:21.360
 cholesterol synthesis ability is to avoid polyunsaturated fatty acids because they turn off

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:28.880
 the synthesis of cholesterol and interfere with its use in the cells. Yeah, okay. I know I've had

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:36.000
 this question put to you before. In terms of raising your cholesterol, you've always advocated

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.240
 orange juice as a good fructose source that would actually increase a person's cholesterol. Yeah,

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:50.240
 getting the cell energized with sugar and supplementing thyroid if necessary. Yeah,

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.880
 so if you were able to do this, you're saying you think the cholesterol here itself would be

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.040
 distributed evenly throughout the body and actually in the skin you would wind up with a

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:05.920
 higher concentration of cholesterol than before? Yeah, except if your body is already saturated

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:13.120
 with polyunsaturated fats, they will interfere with it and misdirect, put it into harmful forms.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:22.160
 The aging brain has much less, about half as much free cholesterol as the young brain,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:28.960
 but it fills up with the ester form combined with polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.320
 Okay, so apart, and again it's just good to refresh me on this subject, but in terms of,

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:42.160
 you've always said that four years is a rough approximation for the turnover of lipids in the

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:50.000
 cell. So given that you had a completely exclusive diet of saturated fats and you completely excluded

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.280
 polyunsaturated, after four years there should be a fairly good turnover within the cells.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.720
 How is this the same with the brain, for example, if you're talking about the polyunsaturates

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:08.160
 causing damage in the brain and interfering with energy production and the whole thing

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:14.240
 for dementia and etc down the road? Every night there's a tremendous turnover of lipids in the

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:21.600
 brain, but when you're asleep your blood sugar falls and the free fatty acids tend to be liberated

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:30.240
 from your fat stores. And so if you have bad fat in your fat tissue during the night, it's going to

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:37.920
 be in the blood vessels when your brain is remaking itself. So if you can keep your blood sugar up or

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:44.720
 get your fat so that it's pretty saturated, then your brain every night remakes itself considerably.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:50.080
 Okay, and then this is again, it's a little off topic, but we've gotten on to the,

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:56.640
 excuse me, the topic of cholesterol. What about the, I think you mentioned this chemical to me a

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:02.320
 month or two months ago, hydroxymethylbutyrate as a producer of cholesterol, was it a precursor?

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.640
 Yeah, it's a precursor that supposedly helps to increase it.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.640
 I think most people are always thinking about decreasing their cholesterol, but I'm always

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.200
 thinking about increasing it. I know my cholesterol is actually low. I almost have a

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:24.480
 problem with it. It's probably 135, 140. It's very important to get it up to 160.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:31.120
 Bodybuilders are the ones experimenting with this precursor, but I haven't heard much from them

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:36.080
 about its effectiveness. Interesting. Well, I'm due to get some basic blood work here done in the

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.560
 next month or two, and I'll see if it actually has increased through using this product. Because I

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:47.360
 know it varies quite a bit, and I think that may either be a seasonal variation with whatever food

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:53.040
 groups that we're particularly eating, whether it's the fruits and those sweet, juicy things

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.640
 during the summertime, or probably gravitating towards less of that and probably having to rely

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:05.600
 more on things like gelatin and meats in the winter times without so much fresh fruit. But anyway,

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:12.640
 it's coming up for half past seven here. So if people have any questions, the number is 707-923-3911.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:18.400
 Give us five minutes or so. I think we have one or two callers kind of waiting. Let's just sit

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.040
 tight here. Actually, people were concerned about the roads, and I can let you know that the big

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:28.880
 tree is still across the road on the ave near Weyott, but it seems as though the power line is

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.920
 off the road at Elk Creek Road. A caller will call us back and let us know for sure. But still,

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.800
 please drive very carefully. There are traffic hazards everywhere.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:53.680
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, if I can get into antivirals and have you give your perspective, because I know

00:22:53.680 --> 00:23:03.280
 it's very different. And again, it takes a kind of a constant relearning in terms of cementing this.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:14.080
 But the viricides per se, whether or not they are the latest and greatest direct acting antivirals

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:20.960
 or plant-based antivirals that are specific antivirals for things like herpes or whether

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:28.080
 they're for cytomegalovirus or the whole Zika thing that's happened here or dengue fever.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:35.120
 There's lots of fairly current research which has been done on medicinal plants and the components

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:42.080
 of those, and I'll get into those a bit later and ask you if you know anything about them in terms

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.720
 of the structure, because I think that's the important part. Lots of them seem to be flavonoids

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:53.920
 and essential oil components, which seem to have quite a high affinity for viricidal activity.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:24:04.560
 But within the actual role of viruses and how they take over the cell to manufacture their

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:12.000
 own virions and replicate, and in things like hepatitis, they reach huge proportions and burst

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.560
 out of the cell, liberating millions of new viruses. And this whole thing just seems to be so

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:26.480
 out of this world and sci-fi. Part of our genome is viral and is part of probably our historical,

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:33.360
 you know, being in contact with viruses historically, how these things have just

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.320
 become part of our makeup. And I'm not saying it's good, and I don't think you would say that

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:45.840
 viruses are good either, but in some ways I think you've said that they are messengers and can be

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:52.720
 used or can be understood in some beneficial terms. But if you have anything to say on that,

00:24:52.720 --> 00:25:00.800
 then I'll question you about some of the specifics. A very large part of our genome resembles the

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:09.760
 retroviruses. But when you wonder how viruses came into being, since they can only exist in

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:19.040
 the cells of higher animals, they obviously derive in some way from the higher animal's

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:28.000
 genetic material. And it's only in the last several years that Western biochemists are

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:35.760
 starting to recognize that there are particles circulating in our blood and lip system.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:46.800
 A Korean 60 years ago claimed that he discovered a third circulatory system other than blood and

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:56.400
 lymph, which carries particles of genetic material. And about 10 years ago, this was actually

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:05.760
 documented to not the third circulatory system, but the fact that there are very small particles

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:15.520
 of nucleic acids circulating in the blood and lymph carrying genetic information to repair cells or

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:24.560
 change their functions. The particles are so small that people examining blood under microscopes just

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:31.440
 considered it to be sort of dust in the background. But with proper magnification, they see that there

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:39.680
 are these micro vesicles, they call, which bud off from the surface of cells or exosomes, some of

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:49.040
 them are called. They carry both DNA and RNA and proteins and other parts of cells that act as

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:59.920
 signals, for example, between a working organ like the lungs and the turnover of cells in the bone

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:07.600
 marrow that are producing stem cells and immune cells and so on. So all of our organs are

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:15.200
 communicating with each other through these little particles that are about the size of viruses and

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:22.480
 that contain genetic information and proteins the way viruses do. Do you think there's anything,

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:30.480
 well, let's say the word useful about viruses? I mean, I've always imagined viruses just to be

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:36.960
 the bad guys and just you don't want to pick up a virus if you can at all avoid it, because

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:43.360
 there's nothing good about them. Is there anything to be said for viruses? I know most viruses,

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:48.960
 the smart ones at least try to keep the host alive. But a lot of viruses, you know, end up with

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:57.760
 causing morbidity and early death. So when bacteria are exposed to a dangerous environment,

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:07.920
 such as antibiotics, they are able or starvation, they are able to edit, re-engineer their own

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:18.720
 genes to produce adaptive changes. So it's now recognized that bacteria are capable of

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:25.840
 non-random so-called mutations for defensive adaptive purposes. And when one bacterium

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:33.280
 achieves the immunity to a certain thing in the environment, they can conveniently

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:41.440
 pack it up into a little exosome, a plasmid, which they pass on to their neighbors. So it spreads

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:51.600
 like a viral infection. It's like a self-constructed virus that the bacteria pass on

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:59.760
 for the defense of the community. And within our body, we're passing these little plasmids

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:06.320
 or micro-vesicles to different parts of the body. When we eat another organism,

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:14.240
 we incorporate some of their DNA into our own cellular DNA. You eat beef and you get some

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:20.640
 cow DNA incorporated in the cells. You eat carrots and you get some carrot DNA.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:31.840
 In that sense, we're communicating across species all the time genetically. It's kind of equivalent

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:45.280
 to what the bacteria do defensively. But I imagine that viruses have some of that function so that

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:58.400
 if it's in our genes and it's like a bacterium can use its adaptive ability to change its genes

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:06.240
 or to find this plasmid that it has received from a neighbor. I think we have the ability to

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:14.320
 look into our genetic reservoir, including carrot and cow genes, to see what's useful.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:22.400
 And that these things, if they aren't useful, if we're not able to adaptively use them,

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:30.480
 if our energy is very low, then they can cause trouble. They can interfere with our adaptation.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:37.280
 But if our energy is high, I think getting these particles of genetic information

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:43.520
 can actually increase our repertoire. Very good. Interesting. Okay. Well,

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.840
 I think we have a caller on the line. So let's take this first caller. You're on the air. Where

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.200
 are you from, caller? What's your question? I'm from New York. Andrew, by the way, great

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:59.520
 questions tonight. Really excellent job. I want to ask you two questions, but I want to follow

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:06.480
 up on the cholesterol, if you ask me in context. The total cholesterol, 2225 to 230 for older

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:12.160
 people. What about, is that the only one that matters? There's triglycerides, there's LD,

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:18.560
 HDL. And it's very hard to know how to consider those. What are the appropriate ranges,

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:23.440
 even relative to someone who has a normal cholesterol, let's say, of 225?

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:33.200
 Okay. So Dr. Peat, what would you say about HDL, LDL, triglycerides in terms of their range?

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:43.040
 Actually, let's start off. You actually view, quote me if I'm wrong, but the quote unquote bad

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.560
 cholesterol is not what you see as a bad cholesterol at all. You see that actually is a

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:51.440
 building block for manufacturing steroid hormones.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:32:01.360
 Okay. Maybe I engineer as, I think our engineer might've hung up.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.520
 We just lost Dr. Peat somehow. I'll get him back.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.720
 Okay. Well, let's just, I guess we can do some music or something until Dr. Peat comes back on.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:16.240
 I could just discuss the next subject, but it seems a little, it seems a little wry,

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.320
 unless we have him on the line.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:33.280
 Okay.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:39.840
 Well, like I said a little bit earlier on, we'll hopefully get into some of the medicinal plants

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:46.560
 that have been shown to be viricidal, viristatic, and just briefly talk about some of the compounds

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.280
 that are responsible for those effects. So anyway, I think we have the call back. We have Dr. Peat

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:56.160
 back, hopefully. Dr. Peat, you there? Yeah. The part of his question I heard was

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:02.800
 about triglycerides. Yeah. He said, what was the relative proportions of the other components,

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:12.080
 HDL, LDL, and triglycerides? But I know that you view LDL and HDL differently to the way that they

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.640
 would class them good and bad cholesterol. You don't actually look at them that way. So the

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:22.800
 question was the relative proportions in terms of what would be healthy or normal, given that you

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:27.520
 advocate a slightly higher cholesterol than what would typically be seen as a regular normal

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:36.080
 cholesterol. Yeah. When you're low density, cholesterol is low. That's what increases the

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:44.480
 cancer risk or dementia risk, too. But the things that poison your liver or stress you increase the

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:54.640
 HDL. And it happens that that protein that forms the HDL is anti-inflammatory. So it's a defensive

00:33:54.640 --> 00:34:02.720
 reaction to stress. Estrogen and alcohol, for example, will increase the HDL defensively.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:12.800
 But the LDL is a protective source of the cholesterol. And if the triglycerides are

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:21.440
 fairly saturated, they aren't very harmful. They found that heart failure is actually

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:30.480
 less of a problem if your triglycerides are high. But if the triglycerides are polyunsaturated,

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:40.640
 that goes with interference with the function of the cholesterol. And free fatty acids are

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:48.640
 the dangerous form of fats in the blood. They have multiple interference, for example,

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:57.600
 with oxidative metabolism and the use of sugar. But the triglycerides are pretty innocuous. They're

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:04.640
 just evidence that you're under stress and not using your sugar properly.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.360
 Okay. That was a good question.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:12.560
 My question that I had before Andrew asked that question earlier, that was a follow on,

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:21.040
 relates to a 22-year-old. Just as an example, he sprains his ankle. The ligaments, some ligaments

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:27.600
 are torn. Some are stretched. Let's say one is stretched, one is torn. And he's trying to get

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:34.240
 back and walking. It's entirely blown up with swelling and stress, as you know. When that

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:40.960
 happens, it turns. What are the three or four things that you would do to make sure that it

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:48.080
 heals properly? Meaning that I think, based on what I've read, is you think that healing is

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:54.320
 ideal in a baby when there's no scar tissue. But we're told that scar tissue has to form in order

00:35:54.320 --> 00:36:01.600
 for the torn ligament to attach back to the bone and for the stretched ligament to tighten up on

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:06.160
 its own. You will have to form scar tissue for that to happen. And we're thinking that that

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:11.680
 might lead to arthritis, et cetera, down the road. So I'm just wondering, right now, to avoid

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:20.160
 problems with arthritis 20 years from now, what is someone who is a 22-year-old, what should they

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:27.200
 be doing now to heal the injury quickly and focus on the long-term low scar tissue outcome?

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:37.040
 Things to keep the free fatty acids low so that you use your glucose as efficiently as possible

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:46.800
 to produce anti-inflammatory things like carbon dioxide. And aspirin and niacinamide, for example,

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:56.000
 are anti-inflammatory things that reduce the disorganizing kind of scar tissue and promote

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:04.320
 maximum quality healing with a minimum of excess random collagen deposition.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:11.920
 Gotcha. Okay. And so red light and CO2 would also be useful, but those are more short-term

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:18.240
 trauma-reducing issues. The actual intake of low-proof aspirin and niacinamide, you're saying,

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:23.440
 will help reduce the scarring yet facilitate healing properly.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:30.800
 And vitamin D and vitamin K are very important. Getting enough calcium in your diet with vitamin D

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:38.800
 so that you keep your parathyroid hormone suppressed to keep the tissue energy high,

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:47.120
 including salt in your diet to keep the aldosterone to a minimum because aldosterone

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:57.040
 promotes disorganized collagen healing and fibrosis. So some unexpected things, sodium and

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:02.160
 calcium in the diet are protective to the healing of connective tissue.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:09.200
 Gotcha. So the last aspect of this, if a doctor tells you, a trained doctor says, "Gee, the only

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.160
 way it's going to heal is when the scar tissue develops."

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:23.040
 Well, good scar tissue is fine, but the worse your metabolism is, the more disorganized the

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:30.320
 scar tissue is so that a keloid, for example, is terrible scar tissue, very disorganized because of

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:39.520
 polyunsaturated fats in your circulation, disorganizing the healing. A baby in utero

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:49.120
 with no essential fatty acids in circulation and plenty of carbon dioxide will heal without

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:55.120
 any disorganized structures. That's a great answer and I appreciate that. Can I ask one

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:59.280
 other question, Andrew? Very quick because we do have a couple of other callers, so let's be quick.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:05.600
 Will do. So let's say an older person has fungal toe and they've had it for a really long time.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:14.640
 Someone has suggested mixing equal parts of apple cider vinegar and hydrogen peroxide and soaking

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:22.720
 the toe for 30 minutes each day for about a month. I know you've mentioned sulfur,

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:28.880
 but what do you think about this idea? I've tried it and it does change. It does have a

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.720
 physiological effect, but I'm not sure whether it's a good one or a bad one. So that's...

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.000
 How about iodine, Dr. Peat?

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:43.920
 Yeah, iodine is a good fungus killer. Vinegar is a pretty fair antagonist to the fungus.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:49.760
 Uh, in combination with hydrogen peroxide, because that seems to be a fantastic product.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:56.240
 Both of them individually, I imagine together they work all right too.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.400
 Okay, so I just another way to do it. So you're okay with that approach?

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:08.080
 It sounds very safe. You can damage this tissue with too much hydrogen peroxide.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:17.120
 Once I spilled some 30 percent peroxide on my finger and it turned strangely paper white,

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:23.760
 and I stuck it in a bottle of ascorbic acid and in a flash it looked normal.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.160
 All right, well thank you for your call, Gawler.

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:26.720
 Thank you.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:30.400
 Yeah, we'd like to get these next people able to ask. So next caller,

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.080
 you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question?

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:41.360
 Hi, I'm from Calgary, Alberta. And Dr. Peat, I had followed your suggestion to take coconut oil,

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:48.400
 but I find that every single time I try it, I've tried taking it and then removing it from my diet.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.640
 Every time I try to take it, it does wonderful things for me, but it causes me really,

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.200
 really bad digestive distress. And I'm wondering why.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.640
 What kind of coconut oil is it?

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:10.000
 Um, I did try the, like the ultra purified or whatever it's called. And then lately I've been

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.760
 taking the, like the scented one. Not scented, but like not refined.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:26.640
 I found that the nice tasting unrefined ones were harder on the intestine. And the ultra refined and

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:32.640
 even hydrogenated coconut oil, I find is easiest on the intestine.

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:39.120
 Okay. Okay, good. And I mean, did you, out of curiosity, did you ever find that

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:43.120
 happened to you? Like when you were first starting it or was it fine?

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:51.280
 No, I did find that different brands, if they, if you put it on a hot frying pan and if it smells,

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:57.760
 then it's more likely to hurt your intestine. It should be odorless when it hits a hot pan.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.720
 Okay. Okay. Good to know. I'll give that a try and hopefully it works.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:07.680
 Cause honestly I've had great success with it. I, um, you know, normally without it,

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.960
 I can't go long without eating, like I'll get really low blood sugar,

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.520
 but it helps me go so long without eating. It's absolutely incredible. So I'm really

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.120
 thankful for your suggestion and thank you for having me on the air tonight.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:22.960
 Okay. Thanks for your call caller. Okay. So let's take this next call.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.440
 I'll call you on the air. Where are you from? And what's your question?

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:33.120
 Caller you're on the air. Caller. That's why we say, listen on your

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:39.440
 phone, not on the radio. Three, two, one next caller. You are the caller.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.720
 Okay. Caller you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question? The other

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:47.280
 caller should call back incidentally, if they can use a regular landline, that would be great.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.440
 Yeah. I could hear that. I'm on, uh, I'm from Toronto.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.320
 Okay. Wow.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.840
 To hear me. Yeah, I can go ahead. What's your question?

00:42:55.840 --> 00:43:04.160
 Okay. Uh, what can an individual do who has an opportunity to kind of intercept a psychopath

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:08.400
 and prevent the damage the psychopath would do to others? I just want to know if

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:15.680
 Ray Peat has any, uh, insight into that kind of psychological, uh, condition. Uh,

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.920
 cause it seems that, uh, psychologists say there's nothing that can be done to,

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:28.080
 to normalize a psychopath or a cluster B. And I understand it makes up like 14% of the population.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:31.760
 And does it have something? Yeah. Is the psychopath on medication?

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:39.680
 Uh, yeah, probably. I'm not sure if they are on medication or not, but, uh, might have something

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:48.320
 to do with, uh, yeah, bipolar or a separate type of diagnosis. Well, Dr. Peat I'm not too sure there's

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:55.760
 an answer for it, but if anyone's got one, you have, uh, keeping the brain well energized.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:04.560
 And, uh, yeah, that means keeping the blood sugar steady. Uh, uh, sometimes, uh, just a very

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:10.800
 digestible diet can make a person feel so much better that they don't have to exploit and

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:17.040
 manipulate other people. And that might have something to do with the sort of narcissistic,

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:23.040
 uh, quality to it. That, uh, it might be kind of a, a sort of a food, uh, condition, not,

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:30.800
 not wanting to eat or, or, or kind of, uh, having low calorie intake. So, uh, yeah, I think

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:39.200
 addictive personality that needs alcohol or drugs and such is somewhat in the same boat, uh, needing

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:47.120
 something that's, that they, uh, can't get themselves that they, uh, try to, uh, uh,

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:53.200
 control others to make their life better. But if their life suddenly becomes better by changing

00:44:53.200 --> 00:45:01.920
 their metabolism, uh, I've seen a lifetime addicts to alcohol or heroin or cocaine just overnight,

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:08.560
 literally, uh, drop their addiction. Good. Excellent. Okay. Well, let's just, uh, leave

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.960
 the rest of the show open for people who might want to call in. Uh, there's just about seven

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:19.840
 minutes left, I think. So the number, if you would like to call is 707-923-3911. Uh, Dr. Ray

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:27.200
 Peat is joining us and, uh, we'll start to get into some of the, um, topic of, uh, viruses and

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:33.040
 viricides and, uh, the kind of latest, uh, research that's been done. And we'll probably have to

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:37.200
 carry this over till next month. So, uh, people, if they've listened to this and we're expecting

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:43.120
 to get some more than, uh, the last segment of this show on the subject, then next month,

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:50.640
 I think we'll probably carry this over. So Dr. Peat, um, again, I've questioned you about viruses

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:58.000
 and I, we, I've questioned you many times about, uh, things like hepatitis virus and, um, how we

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.160
 talk, I know you've mentioned the Zika virus outbreak that I think you would have a very

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:08.720
 different, um, uh, explanation for. And you've mentioned, uh, I think a person's physiology

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:16.320
 and the terroir of the person being very responsible for actually having an outcome of,

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:22.000
 uh, coming down with it or resisting it. And I think that's, uh, I think that's quite, quite a

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.280
 fit answer. Um, let me just hold on a second here cause the lights are going crazy in the, uh, in

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:32.000
 the engineer's room there. So I'm not too sure whether he's lining, lining people up. I think

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.640
 he is. Uh, I probably just hold that train of thought cause we have a caller. So yeah, uh,

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:40.480
 caller you're on the air. In fact, we have two. So let's take this first caller on the air and

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:46.640
 what's your name and where are you from? What's your question? Sorry. I'm Robin. Am I on? Yeah,

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:54.080
 you're on Robin. Where are you from? Okay, great. I'm from, uh, West Haven. From where? West Haven,

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:59.280
 Humboldt County. Oh, okay. Go ahead. What's your question, Robin? Yeah. Um, and you should turn

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.520
 your radio down. I think you, I think you might have a radio on in the background. Yeah. Will

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:13.120
 you turn that radio down? Good. Um, one is about gallbladder and healing it. Okay. And, um, I have,

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:18.800
 I'm, my gallbladder's not, you know, not functioning very well. Okay. And, and a friend

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:26.240
 was talking about doing a fast, a great fast, um, which I've been hearing about, like, you know,

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:32.560
 intense fasting and that that can be really helpful. In fact, my naturopath also recommended

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.480
 it. So I wanted to hear what Dr. Peat had to say about that. Well, intense fasting is definitely

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:41.520
 not to be recommended. So first I will let Dr. Peat go for it, but, um, go ahead, Dr. Peat. Did you say

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:49.200
 grape? Grape fasting? Yes. Yeah, I did. Great. Yeah. Years ago, I read a book called The Grape

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:59.600
 Cure by a South African doctor. And, um, I knew people, uh, someone started a little health clinic

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:09.440
 across the border in Mexico, uh, based on the, the grape diet. And so I investigated, uh, that was

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:17.760
 one of the things that got me interested in the purple pigment in the grapes and other fruit as a

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:29.040
 stimulant to proper oxygen use. And, uh, combined with sugar and the, uh, minerals in grape juice,

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:36.640
 uh, grape juice does have a great therapeutic effects or, or, uh, just eating the whole grapes,

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:45.440
 but either one, uh, it has many, uh, therapeutic effects. So, um, the call of Robin, um, in terms

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:50.400
 of your gallbladder, do you have things like obstruction or do you have deficient bowel

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:54.720
 production and fat intolerance? Or what's, what, what's the diagnosis with your gallbladder?

00:48:55.360 --> 00:49:02.320
 I have fat intolerance. There's nothing showing up on ultrasound, but I also have, um, you know,

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:10.320
 kind of a whole mix of, um, hypothyroid and some, um, mold sensitivity. And I'm dealing with SIBO

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:18.880
 right now. And so the gallbladder is very sensitive to low thyroid function or high estrogen in

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:27.520
 relation to progesterone. Progesterone relaxes it. Estrogen tends to cause spasms and, uh, the,

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:35.280
 the sick reaction to fats is because the thresholds are lowered by the high estrogen to progesterone

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:44.160
 ratio. And the key to it is almost always low thyroid function. You correct your, your metabolism

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:52.880
 by getting your body temperature up to a daytime, typically around 98.6 Fahrenheit or 37 degrees

00:49:52.880 --> 00:50:01.440
 centigrade. I have also definitely seen a good case in point for, um, plant bitters, uh, based

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:07.280
 on things like the Swedish bitters formula, uh, things that will increase your digestive enzymes

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:12.560
 and your stomach pH and, uh, pepsin production and those kinds of things. The fat intolerance anyway,

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:16.560
 uh, definitely, uh, works very well to reduce flatulence and bloating and that kind of thing,

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:24.640
 which is a kind of derangement of, uh, pH. Okay. Well, we do have one more caller. So let's get

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:29.120
 this, uh, next caller on the air and, uh, caller you're on the air. What's your question? Where

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:35.920
 are you from? Hi. My question is about, uh, I'm from Eureka. My question is about, uh,

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:43.840
 if Dr. Peat knows of any medical condition or cause that would lead a person to, uh, develop, uh,

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:51.200
 digestive issues where there's like a frequent and loose bowel movements, as well as high blood

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:57.520
 pressure, things that just sort of came out of the blue, but about the same time in my life.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:07.040
 Okay. Dr. Peat, did you get that? Um, uh, yeah. Um, uh, there are lots of things that

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:17.200
 can be involved, but, um, uh, stress physiology, uh, it is generally involved in both, uh, uh,

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:25.920
 inflammation and a tendency to diarrhea and, uh, high blood pressure. Uh, and, uh, you, you,

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:31.680
 have you had blood tests? Uh, uh, yeah, yeah. They've, they've been normal.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:38.080
 Uh, everything has been, has looked really good. What do you think about anti-serotonin?

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:50.320
 Yeah. Low thyroid function with a TSH measurement, uh, up to three, they call normal, but, uh,

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:57.520
 anything above one is likely to, uh, promote inflammation, including in the intestine.

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:06.960
 And, uh, high serotonin is the main thing that contributes to, uh, uh, an overactive bowel.

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:13.040
 And it's also, it's, it's named, uh, for its ability to constrict blood vessels and raise

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:19.280
 blood pressure. And, uh, uh, there, there are drugs that will lower it such as, uh,

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:28.000
 cyproheptadine, but, uh, usually you can, uh, change your diet to reduce the inflammatory foods,

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:35.040
 uh, such as starches or, uh, raw or undercooked vegetables that are, uh, support bacteria that

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:44.000
 cause the intestine inflammation. So less starch, uh, and less raw vegetable matter?

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:53.520
 Salads and bread and, uh, beans and, and nuts and even potatoes can, uh, sometimes

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:57.680
 feed the bacteria that cause the inflammation and release serotonin.

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:05.600
 Okay. All right. So, and you look at that, you can, you can, you get a measurement on your,

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:10.320
 the serotonin that you have in your body. I mean, it's a blood test. Do that with blood,

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:17.680
 a blood plat, uh, analysis do that? It will usually show up as increased reverse T3

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:28.720
 and sometimes, uh, an actual low, uh, T3 count. Uh, but, uh, the, the simplest approach to it is to,

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:37.760
 uh, eat a bland fiber. Uh, some people, uh, are okay with, uh, cooked oat bran as a mush,

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:44.800
 but, uh, some bacteria can feed on that and cooked mushrooms and, uh, cooked bamboo shoots

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:52.320
 are, are bland fibers that will, uh, uh, often will lower the serotonin and diarrhea effect.

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.080
 Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:04.560
 Um, Dr. Peat, thanks so much for your time. I'll give out information about how to find more about

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:10.240
 you. Oh, okay. Thanks. Thank you. Okay. So for people who've listened to the show, um, every

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:16.480
 third Friday of the month, uh, we do a one hour talk show, uh, with Dr. Peat is our host and,

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:23.680
 um, he can be contacted, uh, through the internet. He has a website, which is www.raypeat.com.

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:33.680
 R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com. Um, he's got a lot of, uh, well, uh, well-written articles that are fully referenced

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:40.080
 and very educational. Uh, I will say that they are very scientific. So if you're a really are

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:44.960
 a real basic lay person, you might find it a little hard going. Uh, but if you have any real

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:50.640
 interest in science and research, and you'd like to dig deep and find out things, uh, be a very

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:56.240
 good place to look for the articles that will quote why things he's saying are the way they are.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:04.320
 Um, I can also be reached as well, Monday through Friday, um, either email me or, uh, send a, you

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:11.280
 know, voicemail to our, uh, 888 number, which is 1-888-WBM-ERB or, uh, my email address is

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:17.600
 Andrew@westernbotanicalmedicine.com. Um, okay. So until the third Friday of next month,

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:22.000
 I wish you all good night and we will carry on. Just for those listening now,

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.920
 I never got into hardly anything to do with, uh, viricidal activity of compounds, chemicals,

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:32.640
 medicinal plants, uh, and how, uh, we can, again, through Dr. Peat's wisdom,

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:39.360
 best arm ourself with the best possible choice, best possible chance of staying healthy. Okay.

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:45.520
 So till, uh, this same time, third Friday of next month, good night.
