00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640
 Until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's part 2 subject of vaccinations.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.000
 Safety and efficacy are in question.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Now the number here if you live in the area is 923 3911 or if you live outside the area, toll free number is 1-800-568-3723.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Once again I'll be introducing Dr. Raymond Peat to the show in a moment to share his wisdom.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 He's got some new information regarding some facts that have been shown from about 2002 through till now, some fairly recent revelations about parts of the vaccination process which are probably more questionable than ever.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 I guess I want to just open up the show again by what I read out last month on the part 1 of vaccinations which was the first do no harm tenant of medicine.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 The United States legal standard applied to vaccines defines them as, and this is how it's defined, unavoidably unsafe products that are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary use.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 And the reason why vaccines are unsafe or in other words harmful is because they're made up of chemicals and other elements that are essentially poisonous to the body.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 We'll get into some of those things later on in the show.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us again.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 For those people who perhaps have never listened to the show or tuned in before now, would you just outline your academic and scientific background so that people can understand where you've come from and where you are now?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 In the 1950s and 60s I was mostly a student and teacher in the humanities, English lit and painting for example and other subjects.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Then I decided to go to graduate school in biology and biochemistry, University of Oregon for a PhD because I had been interested in that for many years but considered that the academic approach to it was pretty futile and misleading in the 1950s and 60s.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Since graduating in 1972 I've continued studying, trying to find what I consider the main line of science in biology which is very opposed to in many ways the mainstream medical thinking and the biology which is influenced by corporate financing.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 This main line of biological and chemical thinking that I've been following is more holistic and developmental, time oriented way of looking at organisms than the reductionist abstract molecular thinking.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 That's a more molecular approach that has become dominant and that particularly relates to how the immune system works but that isn't an area that I've specialized in.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 I did teach a short course in immunology to medical students in Mexico in 1979 but since then things have radically changed.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 Okay, I think for the purpose of those people who perhaps have tuned in to this evening's show, I think what I wanted to start the show with is something I think if most people listen carefully to the paragraph I'm going to read out next will probably be fairly stunned because they probably never really thought about it.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 I think the generation, my generation perhaps born in the mid 60s and the children from there until now probably have very little awareness of what I'm going to read out next and that's the fact that all infectious diseases were in fact in free fall decline before the introduction of vaccines.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 And this just doesn't enter the consciousness of most people, it's veiled by the fear and the mysticism surrounding disease and its apparent cure with polio and smallpox as examples in most people's consciousness as reasons for vaccines when in fact this is not the truth.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Starting I guess in the 1800s with massive overcrowding and open sewers and poor hygiene and poor nutrition, this is largely responsible for the pandemics and the epidemics that ravaged Europe at the time.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 When the reformations happened with socioeconomic factors improving with general hygiene, nutrition, the amount of time people were working and the kind of housing and living conditions people were in, the figures that I have and there's a book that's written by Susan Humphreys and that book is entitled Dissolving Illusions, Disease Vaccines in the Forgotten History.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Now Dr. Susan Humphreys is actually, well was, actually still is a medical doctor but she's not practicing medicine within the Medical Association.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 She was very much put off of the mainstream, we call it the mainstream medicine and you've already mentioned that Dr. Peat, that the holistic approach that a lot of science will take to achieve a truth is largely avoided or covered up with continuing mistruths or misinformation shall I say.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 That permeates the medical industry.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 So the book that she wrote after, basically after coming across a kidney damage that was initiated from influenza vaccines and she was actually a nephrologist.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 She was a nephrologist for about 10 infectious diseases that were prevalent at the time and those ranged from measles, smallpox, typhoid, whooping cough, diphtheria, polio, syphilis and malaria and the evidence that she found was that there was a dramatic decrease in the incidence of these diseases mostly around the early 1900s to the end of the Second World War.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 So why do you think the vaccines have become what they are now in people's minds and that I believe is that we can't do without them when in fact it was all virtually disappearing due to improved health and sanitary conditions.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 I think the medical attitude has been developed for more than 100 years.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 My parents and grandparents were born really before the medical indoctrination got underway in the United States and Europe.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 In history there were people teaching doctors to vaccinate and indoctrinating the medical community with the idea but in my parents' generation they were pretty immune to it.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 They were forced to be vaccinated in the schools but it was only a somewhat later generation I think more or less coinciding with the American Medical Association taking over medicine and abolishing for about 60 or 70 years the natural approaches to medicine such as naturopathy.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 The drug treatment approach rather than the improving general health approach was part of that takeover of medicine.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 Several people fairly recently have pointed out that vaccines are really just a cheap way of controlling some infections when it's too expensive to give people good food and a clean environment.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 It's recognized that that will prevent the infectious diseases but that it's too expensive.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 I was going to be one of my questions to you was going to be that how did you feel about the argument that's been put forward that it is actually an economic situation rather than a holistic situation where if we had good clean food and it wasn't contaminated with GMOs

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 and it wasn't laboratory produced but was just good wholesome organic clean food and that's the way we did raise our crops and that's how people ate and people weren't brainwashed into believing that butter is bad for you or sugar is bad for you or that dairy products are bad for you but actually if people ate and were exposed to good wholesome nutrition there would automatically be an increase in people's general health.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 But that isn't really in the interest of industries producing supposedly necessary products for our ill health.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Last month I mentioned the World Health Organization study in Central America that showed that giving a little tiny bit of economic support such as clean water and a nutritious porridge supplement for pregnant women and children that that improved the health of the study village relative to one that had no intervention

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 and the one that had the intervention with doctors and vaccines and standard medicine the health went down during the study period.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 That actually said medicine is bad for you but even the cleaning up of the environment which the Rockefeller Foundation was a leader in trying to prevent hookworm infection for example and improving nutrition in schools.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 That was done because it was realized that sick undernourished mentally undeveloped people didn't make good workers.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 So there is a way of looking at cleaning up the environment and feeding people that it's good for the corporate economy too but it happens that it's even cheaper to use vaccines and more profitable.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Even if it wasn't necessary if the environment got clean enough and people were well fed it would still be very profitable to sell the chemical and vaccination approach to health.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 Yeah, okay, I think a little bit later on we'll get into well I know well let's just mention it now the and this is in California too and have a good friend who's done quite a bit of research into vaccinations and I know that I think she's had shows here before now on the subject but that the increase in the other form of pertussis border teller parapertussis.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 She was stating that the the regular a cellular pertussis vaccination is actually increased the border teller parapertussis colonization in children and that a lot of children who have this unknown etiological condition with fever and feeling unwellness but don't have this typical cough.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 That actually this is a border teller parapertussis colonization that's come around from vaccination and that the whooping cough vaccine is actually responsible for this in itself.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Have you heard anything about border teller parapertussis?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 No, not at all.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Okay, yeah, all right.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Anyway, just thought I'd mentioned that because I think that was fairly relevant.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Okay, so I think if we want to carry on I think a main thrust of what we want to look at this evening is that there are there's lots of evidence and it's more about taking taking responsibility.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 I won't say control because it's got some bad connotations but taking responsibility for your own self if you want to be as healthy as you possibly can and educating yourself and not just not just taking everything that comes from mainstream media as the truth and buying into it but being open minded enough to turn your head this way and that way to see the other see the other side of what's going on.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 So I know last month we had a couple of callers one of which in particular and I could understand her feelings about this that she was saying that you know back in the 20s and there about some of her relatives had died from either smallpox or from measles even and actually, you know, this the death was a fairly serious fairly serious psychological thing that she was dealing with that her ancestors had died of this and how could we how could how could I bring up a show saying that?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 Why was vaccination avoidable and you know in the light of her understanding that actually vaccination was the supposedly the main reason why everyone was healthier but I think from a overcrowding perspective definitely in the 1800s and later on until probably after the First World War maybe the 30s and 40s when things started improving radically there was a lot of infection and disease about but very much in the context of the pandemic.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 Very much to say that I think each one of us individually are responsible for what happens to us we're not or we really shouldn't be even if some people think that they are just guinea pigs and they don't have any control they don't have any say we're very much in control of what someone else does to us or what we're prepared to put in our mouth and we're very much responsible for seeking out information and being aware of our surroundings.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 Otherwise I think we are very much likely to die prematurely from something else that could be probably avoidable.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 In terms of the immune system and we'll get into the kind of vaccine theory and maybe discuss some parts of why the theory is pretty erroneous and could be leading to problems down the road.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 I know last month you mentioned the fact that we are a conscious living stream or a stream of consciousness and basically from birth until death that stream is constantly evolving and is subject to being affected by the things that come into our environment come into our minds and our ears etc.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 So in terms of immunity in the body I know obviously that you're very you advocate thyroid hormone and general dietary advice that is on the anti-inflammatory side and use those examples physiologically to show and prove that these things are scientifically correct.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 In terms of the immune system and what happens with vaccination would you just describe the kind of basic immune system what they call the innate immune system versus the kind of adaptive immune system and then we'll perhaps talk about how they actually vaccinate you and then obviously get into the adjuvants the aluminum and the other products that they put in these vaccines which are coming up as being responsible for various different things.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Currently the medical community especially is emphasizing the difference between the innate immune system which is they speak of it as the first barrier to infection and the adaptive system which learns to be specific.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Specifically immune to invading organisms and it can be trained by exposing it to the organisms or a fraction of them put into a vaccine.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 The 1908 Nobel Prize was divided between two proponents of theories of immunity Paul Ehrlich and Ilya Metchnikoff.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Metchnikoff was an embryologist who emphasized the role of phagocytes in destroying or isolating invading material and reconstituting a healthy organism.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 Ehrlich was interested in the staining properties of cells and this made him of interest to the chemical companies.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 He showed that the chemicals which could stain organisms specifically could also react with equal specificity to pathogens.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 The idea of a magic bullet came from his approach to chemical specificity.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Mercury and arsenic were early examples, later sulfur drugs that had some specificity to killing the pathogens.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 It was the context for almost all thinking about adaptive immunity and how that specificity could be evoked by vaccines.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 Meanwhile, the developmental innate resistance that Metchnikoff talked about was ignored until Jamie Cunliffe and Pauli Matsinger in the 90s revived the idea around the concept of danger or damage to the tissue.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 This was analogous to when Metchnikoff stuck a splinter into a jellyfish and showed that it was engulfed by phagocytes wandering cells that could eat invading material and turn it to nutritious use.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 That was a complete rethinking of the specific chemical orientation of the adaptive immunity people.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Especially in the 60s and 70s with the idea of the clonal selection of randomly varied molecules in the immune system,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 the genes were simply churning out random possibilities and the exposure to molecules of the host organism or invading organisms.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 These would govern the selection or destruction of these randomly generated molecules.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 Linus Pauling had proposed an instruction theory of the antibodies in which the protein or RNA would wrap itself around, in a sense, the invading material and then compose a protein antibody that would represent the exposure to the shape.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 So it didn't require either an infinite number of genes or a specific rapid mutation that could generate almost an infinite number of variable molecules.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 Since the 1990s, the danger theory has been incorporated into the mainstream of adaptive antibody centered immunity.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 But it pretty much limits itself to thinking of the innate system as first a barrier and second an amplifier of inflammation, which then simply shifts over to making the adaptive system run faster.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 So they've accepted the innate immunity but in a very subordinate way, which is just kind of a first screen and then a booster to the system that they've been working out over the last century.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 How do you feel about the introduction to the adaptive system of fragments of, I don't know, core proteins or RNA that it kind of seems to be supposedly underpinning the science behind vaccines

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 and that the body is then preparing memory T-cells that will jump straight into the fore as soon as they come into contact with the organism in its entirety, as and when you come into contact with the bacteria or whatever the thing is you're being vaccinated for?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 Just by trial and error and empirical results, it's been known for generations that junk added to an antigen makes it produce more active antibodies.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 And following that accidental learning, it was found that alum, an aluminum compound, is a good kind of junk that makes the peptide or the protein of the antigen here to be vaccinated with to make it more effective at forming antibodies.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 And that was just an observed fact without any theory at all to justify it.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 One theory was that the aluminum condensed the proteins or the clotted them and made a little ball of them that for some reason the immune system could deal with better than free-floating proteins.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 But I think the last five or ten years, the tendency is now to see aluminum as an activator of the innate inflammatory process.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 So there's this growing awareness that it is creating a general inflammation, which then makes the specific response of the adaptive system more energetic.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 So in the background, it's recognized that the adjuvant is there probably for the purpose of creating a generalized inflammation in the organism.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 And that's where the long-range view of doing no harm is being neglected because the embryological approach to the organism sees that what happens early in development is going to have permanent,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 lifelong effects on how the organism turns out.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 This is what you mentioned last month about the stream of consciousness, right?

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 Yeah. So if you introduce an inflammatory state early in the life of a person, it's really a matter of waiting 20 or 30 or 40 years to see what the effects of that are going to be.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 And that hasn't been done in any sense because they were so intent on their simplified molecular view.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 They talked about the antigen-presenting cells, which for many years were simply macrophages that caught the germ and then presented it to cells, which could then direct the response of the B cells, bone-derived cells, to make antibodies.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 But now with the new emphasis on the innate immune system as an inflammation amplifier, it's recognized that throughout our skin and mucous membranes, there are cells called dendritic cells,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 which are really the major antigen-presenting cells.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 Many other cell types can do this, not just macrophages, but the massively present dendritic cells in the skin and mucous membranes are what will, in the normal exposure to germs, our skin, our mouth, our nose, lungs,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 these are where the germ exposure happens.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 So it's the dendritic cells mainly which capture the antigen and then present them to mostly the thymus cells, which then activate and instruct the production of antibodies and so on.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 But in the process of capturing and transferring the reaction to the abnormal or pathogenic protein,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 it only works if some of the organism's own cell material, the compatibility factors,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 these are broken down and digested, the antigens are broken down and attached in fragments to the organism's own surface protein groups, compatibility groups.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 It's the combination of the invading peptides with the organism's own normal cell surface that the immunity is developed to.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 And this, in the extreme form of the danger or damage of Jamie Cunliffe, this is the real essence of the whole immune system.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 It's there to restore and maintain the structure of the organism.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 It's not primarily designed to attack and invade.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 Oops, what's happened to Dr. Peat? Where's he gone?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 Dr. Peat?

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 Yes, what was that? I didn't hear.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 I don't know. Everything went quiet.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 I think something might have got played around with in the studio.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 Oh, I thought there was a caller.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 Yeah, well, there are actually two callers on the line, so probably now is a good time.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 I'll pick up after we get off the air with whoever's calling in when they do, and we'll pick up the thread of what you were saying there.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 But let's take this first caller. You're on the air, caller?

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 Hi.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Hi.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 Is that me?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 Yeah. And where are you from?

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 Kansas City.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 Oh, hi. How are you doing?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 I'm doing good.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 My question was on what, Dr. Peat, what's your thoughts on L-glutamine?

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 I've been reading about some people using it to heal stomach ulcers and to restore intestinal integrity.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 I think it should be pretty much limited to what's available in proteins of the diet,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 partly because when an amino acid is manufactured in a pure chemical form, it's always going to have risky contaminants that aren't present in the whole natural protein.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 And secondly, a lot of people have talked about the glucose dependency of cancer cells, but actually glutamine is a favorite food for promoting cancer cell growth.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 And excess of any single amino acid can be harmful for various reasons, including simply overloading you with ammonia as they break down.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 But it's one of the least harmful, so if you had a clean source of it, it would, in some cases, be beneficial, but I still think it's risky.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 Okay. What's the upper limit for glycine on that topic?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 Oh, I think a few grams per day divided into doses of half to one gram at a time, I think, would be safe.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 Okay. You also mentioned in some interviews about activated charcoal to help clean up the intestine if carrots and bamboo shoots weren't doing the job.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 How would you go about using activated charcoal?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 First, you want to make sure that it's clean and hasn't been exposed to contaminants in the environment because it will capture things from the air that it's exposed to.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 But if you're sure you have a clean source, you can simply add it to a drink or to food.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 Like a tablespoon at a time? Is that sort of the dose?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 Yeah, it depends on what you're using it for.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 Okay. All right, then. Thank you.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 Okay. Thank you for calling us.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 Okay. We have a second caller on the air, so let's take this second caller.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 Hi, and where are you from?

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Hello?

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Our engineers are a little -- okay, second caller, you're on the air, and where are you from?

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Hello?

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Hi, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 Oh, Indiana.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Indiana.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 My question for Dr. Peate was about skin tags, and I was just wondering, basically, what's the underlying cause,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 and is there anything topically or otherwise that you could do to get rid of them?

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 Sure. Okay, Dr. Peate.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 I don't really know the underlying cause, but they become very common when a person approaches middle age, the age of 40 or 45,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 and that suggests that there might be a deficiency of the protective stabilizing hormones,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 and since the skin is a major hormone synthesizing organ,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 making sure that you have enough cholesterol and thyroid in your diet

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 so that you can make a generous amount of the protective steroids I think would be helpful.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 Some people have used topical DHEAs dissolved in oil or progesterone dissolved in oil

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 or even just pulverized, micropulverized pregnenolone on the skin,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 and sometimes that will clear up a variety of growths on the skin, including skin tags.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 Okay. Another quick question.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 You guys have been talking an awful lot about inflammation,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 and I was just wondering how Dr. Peate felt about turmeric or ginger

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 or any other kind of herbal thing that's supposed to reduce inflammation, supplementing with them or anything.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 Some people are allergic to those, so even though the research looks very good, especially for turmeric,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 you want to be very careful with any of those herbal things

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 because they have many other components which can trigger strong allergic reactions.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 Okay. Thanks a lot.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 Okay. Well, just for the sake of carrying on, there's another caller on the air.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 Let's take the next caller.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 Hi, caller. You're on the air, and where are you from?

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 Hello?

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 Hello. Oh, you were there. Hello. You're on the air.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 Hi, this is Ed.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 And where are you from?

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 I'm from Laytonville.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 Okay, Laytonville.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 And I'm hoping to ask Dr. Peate.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 It sounds like there's a bit of a delay we've got going, so I'll try to ignore the radio.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 Yeah, turn the radio off.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 I'm hoping to speak to or have Dr. Peate speak to poor memory and focus.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 Okay.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 And I know Dr. Peate talked about some students that were having difficulty in topics being taught,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 and I'm just hoping to have that teased out a bit further.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 Low energy, memory, focus, ADHD, so perhaps you could speak a bit to that.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Sure. Okay, Dr. Peate.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 Having an adequate amount of protein in your diet is an essential first thing.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 And for the average-sized person between the ages of 20 and 60, anyway,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 around 100 grams of good protein per day optimizes everything else being equal,

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 optimizes your mental functioning.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 But there was a study of pilots done by the Pentagon in which high-fat diet was the best for their attention

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 and avoidance of accidents in interpreting information.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 And thiamine, vitamin B1, is used to produce energy from glucose,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 and it can make a tremendous difference.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 If you've been at all deficient in it, it's just spectacular what a supplement of 10 milligrams

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 or more of B1 can do for your mental focus and clarity.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 And if it isn't strictly a simple nutritional problem, it's often low temperature of the brain.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 If your brain is only 94 or 95 degrees Fahrenheit, it just isn't going to function very well in any sense.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 There were studies in which the brain temperature was raised just by heating the head on the outside,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 and they found that memory, quickness of response, clarity of reasoning all increased as the temperature went up,

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 even over 99 degrees.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 I think it was around 101 where the mental capacity was still increasing.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 Incredible.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 I'm not sure how one would know if their brain is at an optimum temperature.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 Eardrum thermometers are the closest way to judge your brain temperature.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 The immediate way.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 The amount of mental activity you're doing can affect the eardrum temperature on different sites differently.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 And to correct that, I mean, even wearing a beanie, would that help raise the temperature,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 or is that a little too exterior?

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 How would one go about that?

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 It can help.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 People who have a low body temperature in general sometimes have insomnia because of the stress it causes,

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 and they find they can sleep better just putting on warm socks and a warm cap.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 I think wearing a warm cap if your head tends to run at a low temperature is likely to help.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 But things in the diet that keep your brain temperature up besides protein include salt and sugar,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 and the steroids, pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone all help to maintain your proper body temperature.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 You've mentioned supplements.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 I often wonder how well they're being assimilated, and I know one would prefer to get them through food,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 but you don't see too much of a problem of buying supplements.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 I don't know if they can be overdone as well.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 An example, protein, I have in the past, for example, had taken amino acid and protein supplements,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 but how much, you said, I believe 100 milligrams of protein, what would that be equal to?

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 Perhaps eggs.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Or beef or chicken.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 Quickly.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 Not to take too much of your time.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 100 grams of protein per day for even smallish to medium-sized people in a military study

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 is optimizing their ability to work mentally.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 Right.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 So I can actually look around and kind of tease out what that would actually equal to as far as portions.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 Yeah, you know, I've definitely suffered from poor memory and focus both immediate

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 and sort of extrapolating that into sort of a long-term perception of future and all that.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 That's sort of the ADHD type of stuff.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 And it definitely gets tiresome.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 So many little further bits you might have towards that end.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 I don't know how much perhaps -- I don't know if you can equate that to maybe early brain damage

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 or maybe exposure to inflammation that you speak of,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 or perhaps just even a characteristic of maybe just various types in the species that have a certain function

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 within the species, a certain type of job that might be -- you know, one might do well in one thing.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 It might not go so well with a modern lifestyle.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 But anyway, just maybe any further thoughts with attention deficit and that sort of thing.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 I'll get off the air.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 But much gratitude to you both, and I always look forward to the show every month.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 So thank you very much.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 Thank you.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 An example of how to get 100 grams of protein would be just three quarts of milk all by itself would provide just about the right amount.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 But you could also get it from 15 eggs or a combination of a quart and a half of milk and a few eggs and some cheese.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 But you can't depend on the protein in nuts and beans, for example, because their digestibility and quality isn't equal to the animal protein such as milk, cheese, and eggs.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 Okay.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 I think we do have another caller on the air.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 So let's take this next caller.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 Where are you from?

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 Yeah, still trying to listen to you guys on the radio and talk to you on the phone.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 I know.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 Not so easy.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 You know, there's a lag.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 I didn't want to miss what you were talking about.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 Oops.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 Let's see.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 I'm from Crescent City.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 A couple things.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 I just want to mention you were talking about covering your head when you're sleeping.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 I find it really helps to sleep if I cover my head with a towel or a shirt or something like that.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 It helps a lot.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 My question was about galanga or galangal.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 First of all, I wanted to know, is galanga and galangal the same thing?

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 Yeah, galanga is, I think, the thing you're talking about.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 They're both the same herb.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 It looks like a ginger, right?

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 Yeah, it's an Ayurvedic Indian herb.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 Sometimes they call it galangal.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 Sometimes they call it galangal.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 I'm trying to get that straight.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 Galangal is used in Thai foods a lot, and it looks like ginger.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 Apparently, from some movie I was watching, it's used as a treatment for some skin cancers.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 Apparently, with some other herbs, it breaks down the membrane that protects the cancers from your immune system.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 So that's interesting.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 So I'm trying to figure out if it's the same thing.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 And then I was also wondering if you know anything about growing it.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 I mean, I've tried, and I wasn't successful.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 I noticed that they were actually selling it at the co-op in Arcata recently.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 And I'm just wondering if you know anything about growing it, anything about its medicinal uses.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 You know, I've never actually used it.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 But, yeah, you're correct in saying that it's a member of the ginger family.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 And as such, it's going to be temperate, well, more tropical environments, so Hawaii probably and Indonesia.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 I don't know you'd have any success growing it in Crescent City unless you had a good hothouse and you were able to keep it.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 Yeah, I tried it in a greenhouse, but it didn't come up.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 And I don't know whether maybe it was just the wrong time of year or it had been frozen or what had happened.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
 So you haven't tried growing it.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 No, I haven't.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 But because it's a member of the ginger family, I wouldn't expect to grow it in a northern latitude very successfully.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 And do you guys know anything about it?

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 Is it medicinal?

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 You know, I've never used it.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000
 I'm sorry to say that it is an herb, but there's lots and lots of them.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 And it's not something I've used.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:37.000
 I've used lots of ginger, obviously, but, you know, it's not one of the plants that I've used in alternative medicine.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 Thank you very much.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 I'm sorry.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 I can be of no help for you that.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 Okay.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 We do have another caller on the air, so let's take this next caller.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 Where are you from?

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 You were on the air.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 Hello.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 Where are you from?

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 Okay.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 Is that me?

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 It is.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 I recognize you.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 Hello.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 Okay.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 Hi.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 Am I on now?

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 Yeah, you're on the air.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 Go ahead.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 Okay.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 I've got a couple of quick questions.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 I'm from Phillipsville, by the way.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 Number one, I've heard a lot about L-arginine, that that's good for you.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 Can you quickly tell me what that does and if it is good for you?

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 It is the precursor to two very important substances.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 One is the energy reserve that backs up ATP, creatine phosphate, but the other one is nitric oxide.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:57.000
 Very often if you simply supplement arginine, you're going to boost nitric oxide, which turns off your ability to produce energy.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
 Oh.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 Which is-

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 So by itself it's not that good?

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 No.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 The L-arginine?

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 No.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 What was that?

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 So you're saying that L-arginine by itself is not that good.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 You have to use it with this oxide stuff?

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 Yeah, I think it's fairly predictably a risk.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 Oh.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 Now the other thing is vitamin D3, I'm not sure what the difference is between vitamin D3 or any other number,

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 but that's what I was advised to take because I have low vitamin D.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000
 Is 5,000 units a day a proper dose?

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 I think that's currently believed to be correct for the average person in the northern-

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 So it's not too much?

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 I've never heard of it being too much.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 Okay, because on the bar it says to take it every other day, and I found that a little odd.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 So you think it's better to take it every day?

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 Yeah, many people are doing that, and I think the most informed people on the subject say that it's perfectly harmless

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 and will usually be an adequate amount where they officially recommended a few hundred units per day.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 It definitely is inadequate for most people.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 Yeah, and the other thing is sugar.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 Now you say sugar is good for you, but haven't I heard you say before that you mean sugar from fruit and not refined sugar?

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 Occasionally, if the rest of your diet is good, refined sugar can be very helpful.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 Honey, for example, provides basically the same as refined sugar with a few extra chemicals that can be helpful.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 Why is sugar helpful?

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 I heard that too much can overact your insulin and cause you to gain too much weight.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:11.000
 Yeah, if you eat too much and you're not getting generally good backup nutrition.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 I recommend it only for therapeutic-specific uses.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 Generally, getting your sugar from fruit is the best because of the minerals and other nutrients with it.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 Well, that sounds right, but yeah, I think that sometimes it might be misleading when you say, "Oh, sugar is good for you,"

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 and people are going to think, "Oh, I can go out and eat donuts and ice cream and that's fine," and I think basically you mean fruit.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
 Yeah.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 Okay. All right, thank you.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 Yeah, I just wanted to say about vitamin D that having seen quite a lot of people's blood work come back from their test for vitamin D,

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 that the reference limit has actually increased in the last year.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 Most people are low.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 Most people do not even really reach the therapeutically recognized level for adequate vitamin D,

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 and so, yeah, 5,000 units a day would not seem excessive.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 Okay, so we've got seven minutes here if anybody wants to call in.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 The number is 707-923-3911 if you're in the area or if you're outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 Were you going to say something, Dr. Peake? I didn't want to cut you off.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 I was talking about seeing the innate immune system as a source of inflammation and a barrier function and something to simply turn on the adaptive immune system that the medical world is thinking about,

00:53:49.000 --> 00:54:02.000
 but I think the inflammatory function is to some extent a malfunction of the innate immune system,

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:17.000
 and it's when the irritation or damage has not been repaired quickly enough that you see a noticeable inflammation.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:25.000
 I think the innate system really is a repair system,

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 and the signals that it sends out which can become inflammatory I think are calling in repair cells to repair the damage,

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:52.000
 and that its ideal function shouldn't reach the stage of inflammation, and it shouldn't activate the adaptive system strongly.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 That's what I see as the proper line of development, thinking of the organism in the long-range, lifelong pattern of development.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 You don't want to overburden your system and misdirect it by causing repeated inflammation.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 An example of why I think it is not primarily a system of producing inflammation is that pregnenolone has been discovered to turn off the immune cells that are activated by, for example, an injury or a parasite or bacteria getting into your skin or mucous membrane.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 The cells should produce their reaction and call in repair processes,

00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:02.000
 and then they should switch over to producing pregnenolone to stabilize cells and stop the inflammation.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.000
 Interesting. Well, we actually have two more callers, but I don't think we're going to get a chance to.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 I think if this next caller can be very quick, and your response, Dr. Peake, without cutting you short, can be equally quick, then perhaps we can take it.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
 Hi, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 Did you guys put me off?

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 No, no, no. You go ahead. Where are you from?

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 I can't hear you. I'm from McKinleyville.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 Okay, yeah. Go ahead with your question, but make it quick.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 Is there a reason why I can't hear you now? Something messed up.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 Oh. Can you hear me now?

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 Hello?

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000
 Turn off the radio. There's an eight-second delay on the radio. Turn off the radio.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000
 Oh, I don't have a radio near me.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
 Okay. Can you hear me?

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.000
 I can hear you now.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 Okay. Well, if you could be quick asking your question, that works.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000
 My question was about the ketosis concept.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 Okay.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 I was curious about ketosis.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 Ketosis.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 And if it's actually the best idea to eat mostly fat and a little bit of greens with no grains and no sugar, I've heard.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:23.000
 No, I think it activates the stress system if you're having to produce the ketones yourself.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 Oh, that's not good? You're supposed to eat grains?

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 If you have them in your diet, precursors that are partly formed already ketones, those are great and are equivalent to sugar, only better.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 I'm not following you.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:55.000
 Well, if you have to turn on the process of making them, it means you aren't getting enough sugar in your diet, enough glucose or protein.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 Where do I find this information? Because everywhere I look, it's the opposite.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 Well, you turn on cortisol production when you don't have enough sugar, and the cortisol has chronic harmful effects, developmental effects.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.000
 So you need sugar, huh? Like fruit or from honey?

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 No, milk has a fraction of sugar about equal to the amount of protein.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 Is there any literature that can back up what you're saying?

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000
 There are articles on my website.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
 All right, bye-bye.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000
 Yeah, thanks for your call. We better call this the end of the evening.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:45.000
 And Dr. Peat, let me give people a chance to reach your website and find out more of what you have there freely available.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
 Thanks again for joining us.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.000
 Thank you.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000
 Okay, so you've been listening to Ask Your Ab Doctor on KMEDGalaxy491.1FM.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000
 The third Friday of every month, we're very pleased to have Dr. Brim and Peat to share his wisdom

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:03.000
 and a very alternative way of looking at what we've all been led to believe is the way things are.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:09.000
 So his website is www.rayPeat.com.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000
 He has lots of articles, fully referenced. They're all free.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:19.000
 Some of them are very scientific in their own right, so be prepared for some re-reading

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:24.000
 and looking through a dictionary maybe to find some of the concepts that he's talking about.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000
 But anyway, very well worth reading and it's fully referenced.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.000
 So none of it's just his fancy or his idea.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:38.000
 It's all very much fully referenced scientific material that's coming out of some pretty new research.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.000
 Okay, so until the third Friday of next month, my name's Andrew Murray.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:48.000
 And if you want to find out more about us, there's an 800 number or 888 number, beg your pardon,

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:53.000
 which is 1-888-WBM-ERB anytime.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 If you want to contact us through business hours 9 to 5, use that number. That'll be just fine.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
 Okay, thanks so much for your time.
