 Hi, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 My name is Andrew Murray and we'll have to wait a moment for Sarah to join us in the studio.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 She's just on a call at the moment.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville, 91.1 FM.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited and welcome to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's topic of the subject of radiation and its widespread use.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Okay, so the number if you live in the area is 923 3911.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Alternatively, there's a toll-free number, 1800 KMUD RAD.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 So we're very pleased to be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat, who has recently published an article about the very subject of the prevalent effects of radiation in the environment

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 and how seemingly subjected we are to it on a daily basis and how it, rather than being a normal fact of life, is really something to be aware of.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 So Dr. Peat, thank you for joining us.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Hello.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Perhaps, as always, people tune in, they've never listened to KMUD before, they're passing through, or some people have just happened to be in front of the radio and haven't heard the show before.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Would you just explain to the listeners your academic background?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 In biology, I started graduate school as a specialist in nerve biology, but I felt that they weren't very scientific, they were so dogmatic.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 I wandered around the various labs until I ran across the reproductive physiology people and they actually seemed to be just getting information and thinking about how the organism works,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 where the nerve biology people were really just trying to develop a dogma more than discover how brains work.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 So I did my dissertation on aging of the reproductive system in mammals.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Okay.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Well, I think with particular relevance to something that you've recently published, I know the controversy surrounding the full body scanners that began rolling out about 2007,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 but of which recently hit the mainstream news on television, I think of last month in November.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 So far as the radiation from, we'll want to get into that a little bit later too, the radiation from medical devices and other sources.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 What's your opinion of the devices themselves in terms of their potential for causing any negative effects through the mechanisms by which you'll describe?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 I think the situation is similar to in the 1950s, the government was assuring the public that fallout from atomic bomb testing in the atmosphere was completely harmless because of their way of explaining the biological effects.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 And they're still promoting those theories of biological effects.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 And even though this kind of x-ray treatment or examining is much less dangerous than the radioactive isotopes falling out of the bomb tests,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 the science by which they assure us of its safety is just exactly as faulty as it was in the 1950s.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 John Goffman, who was a government defender of the safety of radioactive isotopes from bomb tests through most of the 50s, when he suddenly thought about what he was doing,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 saying that we don't know that it is going to have long range deadly effects, so we should keep doing it.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 He just suddenly realized that if the effects are going to be disastrous sometime in the future,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 it's better to learn about the dangers now rather than wait until we're all dead from the long range effects.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 And the trick that they have been using now for almost 100 years, around the beginning of the last century,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 people knew that you could cause mutations in organisms either with radiation or with toxic chemicals.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 And by the 1920s, people were seeing the effects of the mutations or the genetic changes as being in the chromosomes entirely.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 And as the chromosomes and genetic storage seemed to be in the DNA, the doctrine focused on the interaction of radiation with DNA.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 But that was really strictly a matter of reasoning from the fact that they cause hereditary changes

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 and that they decided that heredity was all in the chromosomes and DNA.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 But in the 1960s, people were demonstrating that if you, for example, do microsurgery on a protozoan

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 and just change the orientation of its cilia right on the surface of the cell, that its offspring will, for generations onward,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 will all have backwards cilia on that part of the cell.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 So it's like a biological memory.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 And totally separate from the DNA, the frog biologist, Gurdon, was doing similar things on frog eggs,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 showing that surgery on the surface of a frog egg, generations later, could cause the whole line of frogs to die out,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 even though that egg would mature into an adult.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 That adult could reproduce, but eventually, several generations later,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 there would be no more frogs just from treating the surface of the egg.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 And he showed that if you heat a spot on the surface, you will get mutations.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 But the inheritance wasn't necessarily by way of mutations,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 but it just showed that some harmful influence, other than direct interaction with DNA,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 is able to eventually cause mutations and death.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Okay. Do we actually know what it is at this point in time that's actually transferred several generations down the line,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 even to produce those mutations in offspring later on?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Not really. Just some good guesses.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 A man in Hungary named Csaba, C-S-A-B-A, has been working on what happens with these early life experiences

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 that are passed on from cell to cell and even from adult to its offspring.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 I think that's probably, like you've said time and time again,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 that's the fault with the doctrine of biology, the way it's evolved.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 People are led to believe that things are understood a certain way,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 when in actuality, there's very different reasons why things are changing

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 and they're not actually looking in the right direction.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 So far as the radiation issue is concerned,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 and again, as mentioned, the whole body scanners that are coming into place in American airports across the USA,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 so far as the potential dose of radiation, because I know obviously they want to tell us that these things are safe

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 and that they've been tested, and I even heard of the chap who was giving the speech saying that even his children have been through it,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 and not to say that it's anything good or safe,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 but tell us about the potential risks and what this causes.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 So that is the fact that this can happen, this is a potential risk.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 For 70 or 80 years, people have been noticing that X-rays,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 even in moderate doses, seem to accelerate the aging process,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 and the idea of imprinting is that you might get acceleration of the aging process from generation to generation

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 if that's passed on the way the other cytoplasmic injuries are.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 But the doctrine that everything is controlled by the genes,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 many people insisted that the aging process was the result of accumulating mutations,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 that someone used a chemical mutagen to produce more mutations than the X-ray treatment was producing,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 and the mice that were treated that way lived just as long as normal mice,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 but the X-rays producing even fewer mutations shortened their life,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 so it's a physiological effect and mutations are much less deadly than whatever this other cytoplasmic

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 or general physiological process is.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Okay. Starting then, perhaps just to listeners who perhaps have just started listening to this show,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 we're talking about the inherent risks of exposure to radiation, especially in the light of the whole-body scanners that are being deployed.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 I think there are about 450 airports across the USA at the moment,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 and they plan to expand the range and they want to tell us that they're safe,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 but there's evidence out there to the contrary, and like most things,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 unfortunately, probably 10 or 20 years later on, we'll find even more evidence with actual physical...

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 Well, we probably won't, that's the problem, not in this lifetime.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 It's probably something that's going to take a couple of generations to come through,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 but hopefully the science that underlies that will see that there's a fault in it.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 So far as the difference between what we know as ionizing and non-ionizing radiation,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 what do you have to say about that?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Well, all kinds of electromagnetic or other radiation interact with matter.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 That's how we know that they're there.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Light bounces off something and is absorbed in our retina and we can see things,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 and that light is causing a certain amount of electronic excitation.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 And if you use a blue light rather than a full spectrum centered on yellow,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 the excitation of the electrons is enough to damage the mitochondrial energy production.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 They've seen this for 50 or 60 years, growing plants under different colored lights.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 If you put a plant which thrives in sunlight, if you put it in pure blue light,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 the mitochondria are damaged almost as if they were being irradiated with x-rays or ultraviolet.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 But when you add back the rest of the spectrum,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 there's something about the red light that neutralizes that toxic effect of the blue light.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 And I think that on a slightly different energy scale,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 if you put a piece of glass out in the desert for many years, it turns purple.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 And with a given energy of radiation, you can bleach that purple out of the glass.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 What happens is that electrons are excited by the very energetic radiation

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 and they lose contact with their normal system and are trapped in like sort of the peak of a mountain.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 If you imagine a dimple at the top of the peak, it takes a lot of energy to knock the electron up to that peak.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 But when you shine a just right energy like red light,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 you can typically move an electron out of its little trap and restore it to its normal position.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 That works people who have burned their retina, for example, with ultraviolet light.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 If they get red light soon enough, it prevents the burning.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 You can demonstrate this in seeds and other types of tissue or even a piece of hair will show excited electrons after being in the sunlight.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 But if you shine red light on it, that excitation disappears.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 And so the excitation and moving of electrons isn't strictly an X-ray gamma ray phenomenon.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 It's something that happens in different substances at different energy levels.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 But when you get up to ultraviolet and higher,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 the main effect is that the electrons get completely knocked out of the system.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 And that constitutes ionization.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 But you actually have some degree of sort of ionization, even from blue light.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 And then the non-ionizing type doesn't have the same amount of energy, doesn't displace electrons,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 doesn't have that kind of energy to change an atom.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 You get very similar chemical effects from ultraviolet and X-rays.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 But the good thing is that ultraviolet light is absorbed just a few millimeters into your skin.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 And you get the same kind of damage to the skin cells from ultraviolet that you get to your heart and brain cells from X-rays.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 So it's a very similar biological damage, except the very high energy radiation goes right through you.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 And affects all of your cells.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 Okay. I just wanted to let people know that we were talking about this subject.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 So just want to let people know you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMUD 91.1 Galbraithville.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 And from 7.30 till the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of radiation.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Also, I'm getting a signal that a question would be asked.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 But I'm wondering if we could just wait until we get to that point in the show,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 because I know we want to try and hear as much as possible from you, Dr. Peat.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 In terms of, I think I have to jump on a little bit.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 I wanted to, and I know I have an article actually about the,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 something I think we might have covered a couple of weeks, couple of months back rather, which was by Goffman, John Goffman.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 And that was the article that he'd written on the damaging effects of radiation for medical procedures.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 And a very big article and very well, very well referenced.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 But what I wanted to bring out a little bit more was that the phenomena of red light to reverse the effects

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 or to calm down the excitation of electrons, which is behind the whole free radical thing,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 behind the destruction of tissues and the inflammatory changes and cancers.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 So red light is extremely healing then.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Yeah, the most surprising example of an experiment to demonstrate that was a Russian experiment

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 in which they gave a lethal dose of gamma rays to frogs.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 And the dose was so intense that the frogs would just live a few days after the exposure.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 But within the first hour after exposing frogs to that same intensity of gamma rays,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 if they shined bright red light on them, they didn't get sick at all.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 So we're talking about a red light bulb.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 We're not talking about, are we talking about infrared or are we talking about just red light?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 Red light, but in an ordinary incandescent bulb, if you have a prism or a tapered piece of glass to look at

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 an incandescent light bulb, you'll see that it varies from blue to red.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 And the red end of it is a lot more intense than the blue and green end,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 just because the temperature of the bulb isn't nearly as hot as sunlight.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 Okay.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 Yeah, so red light.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 So there you go, folks.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 If you're listening, the healing, curative effects of red light go far beyond just that mellow kind of ambiance

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 in the room that some people have red light on for.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 So if somebody has been exposed to an X-ray or a form of radiation,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 then what would you recommend they go sit under, Dr. Peat?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Well, if you can do it very quickly, that gamma ray frog experiment shows that within the first hour,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 you can just almost completely block the chain of events that follows the exposure.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 But since people who were exposed to Chernobyl or even the Nagasaki atomic bombing,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 they still in recent years, their blood serum is still toxic.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 They can add it to cells in vitro,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 and the blood from these people who were exposed decades ago is still toxic to cells.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 And so it's similar to the effect of when you irradiate an animal's foot,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 the whole body is influenced.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 The thymus will shrink.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 The ovaries will--if it was intense enough, the ovaries will degenerate.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 The uterus swells up.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 It acts like a systemic dose of estrogen to irradiate any part of the body.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 This is the whole reason why it's so important for people to refuse medical X-rays wherever possible

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 if they have any control over it and to exercise as much diligence as possible

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 when they know they could potentially be in a situation where they could be exposed from these CT scans,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 and that's why we're talking about the whole full-body scanners as another--the most modern form of intrusion.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 The lingering inflammation from exposure a long time ago

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 probably could be affected slightly even years later

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 by getting a very intense exposure to penetrating red light.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 How far, actually, how far into the skin does red light penetrate?

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 Years ago, I made some--the LED, red light-emitting diodes in a paddle,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 so there were about 100 of them side by side,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 and I let my eyes adapt to the darkness until about 2 a.m.,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 and I put this paddle under my thigh, and I could see the bone silhouette.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 The light, just moderate, not really brilliant light,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 but just 100 of these LEDs was enough to go entirely through my thigh,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 showing a shadow for the femur.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 Wow. So it will penetrate that deeply.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 So presumably, at will, haven't it?

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 Would you think it would have an effect within the marrow of bones

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 to have a quenching effect on excitatory damage there?

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 Yeah, I could see the walls, the center of the bone,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 looked almost transparent,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 and I could see the thickening of the cortex of the bone as a dark shadow,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 so it was definitely going right through the marrow, too.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 So I wonder why it is that no one tells anybody about this.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 Has this been public knowledge, say, in the '40s and '50s,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 and it's been just out of fashion and suppressed since then?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Yeah, the information about it being estrogenic started appearing in the 1950s,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 and in my newsletter, I give a little graph that was published by Sigaloff in 1971 and '73.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 He showed that irradiation and estrogen synergize.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 A little bit of one added to a little bit of the other one is like a lot of either of them.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 Right.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 And since you can block the effects of estrogen toxicity with progesterone,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 he tried treating the deadly carcinogenic dose of irradiation,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 treated the animals with progesterone,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 and it essentially completely blocked the cancer formation from the radiation.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 Wow.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 So if you were to advise someone to purchase a light bulb,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 what type of light bulb would you recommend, Dr. Peat?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 A red light bulb?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 No, when they paint or use colored glass,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 it actually doesn't increase the amount of red coming out of the bulb,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 and it makes the bulb more expensive and hotter to handle.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 So just a clear front bulb, but they make them designed to run on 130 volts,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 so when you run them on a standard 120-volt circuit,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 they aren't as blue-biased as ordinary incandescent bulbs.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 They're much weaker in the blue and stronger in the red.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 But they appear to be white light.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Yeah, sort of yellowish-white, warmer than standard bulbs.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 So like a 130 clear front incandescent.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 And what number--how many watts?

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 Oh, I think they come in 150 to 250,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 and the high wattage 250 I think are only about $4 usually.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Okay, good. Thank you.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 Okay, so there you go, folks.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 That's a very cheap and inexpensive way to do some healing on yourself

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 without taking anything into your body that's potentially a problem.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 Okay, so we've reached--coming up to 730,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 so I just want to remind people that we have Dr. Raymond Peat joining us,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 and he's sharing his research and his experience with us once more

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 for his knowledge with radiation and the biological effects of radiation.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 So just to carry on, I know you mentioned at the very beginning of this

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 that the dogma was surrounding the belief that everything was genetic

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 and mutations were carried in the chromosomes,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 and that's not actually the case.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 There is this concept--well, not concept, there is this biological memory

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 that is elicited by something that we don't quite know yet,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 but it has a very real effect later on in generations.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 Between, gosh, radiation and estrogen, I know you've mentioned this before as well,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 that there is also a link in that the liver's ability to metabolize

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 metabolic waste products can be severely influenced by both estrogen

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 and radiation in conjunction.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 What would you say about the possible sequelae of that?

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 The first thing that--the most intense, visible first thing is that both estrogen

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 and radiation interfere with mitochondrial energy production,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 and that is associated with inflammation and adaptive lactic acid production.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 As the carbon dioxide production goes down, lactic acid goes up,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 and the lactic acid itself triggers inflammatory mediators.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 And in experiments with both cells and whole organisms,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 it's been demonstrated that when you irradiate one cell,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 it emits inflammatory mediators that will affect other cells in the same dish,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 even if you put them in the dish later,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 and even taking the medium off the cells and putting it in another dish.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 So it's a chemical that goes into the cell's environment

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 that then will cause mutations, inflammation, degeneration

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 in other cells that are exposed to it.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 So that's what happens when your foot is irradiated.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 The fluids escaping from those damaged cells circulate throughout your body,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 and that inflammatory signal, lactic acid, for example,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 the reason I advise against eating a lot of yogurt and other things with lactic acid

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 is that even natural lactic acid in your diet contributes to formation of fibrotic tissue,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 inflammation first, then fibrosis,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 and within the fibrosis then there's the increased risk of tumor formation.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 I read a part of that article known as the bystander effect,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 that fish exposed to this radiation could affect other fish previously not exposed

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 if the unexposed fish share the same water,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 so there is something coming out of the irradiated animals

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 that is something more than the sum of the radiation.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 And they've been able to block that by using antagonists to serotonin.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 Oh, okay.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 So serotonin itself contributes to fibrosis and impaired energy production and so on.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 And people in this country, they're almost encouraged to use serotonin

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 as a kind of mood type supplement for lifting your mood for seasonal affective disorder

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 and sleep improvement and that kind of thing.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 That seems a little bit erroneous.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 Yeah, the whole system relating to serotonin, for example, it's made from tryptophan,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 and tryptophan has some of the bad effects of serotonin partly by increasing serotonin,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 but also tryptophan happens to be probably the most sensitive amino acid to absorbing radiation.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 It's where, for example, the lens is injured by ultraviolet light.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 It's largely the tryptophan absorbing that energy.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 Okay, so consuming a lot of meat is not a very good idea if you do,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 because the tryptophan in the meat then is another excessive source of tryptophan.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Adults have a very low requirement for tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 How many ounces of meat product, since all muscle meat is very, very rich in tryptophan,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 do you think is a safe limit for a person per day?

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 Well, some experiments with animals in which they've given them almost zero methionine.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 Methionine is one of the amino acids that's very rich in meat,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 and they live 30% to 40% longer when they're almost completely lacking methionine.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Similar effects with tryptophan, these are the anti-metabolic amino acids,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 so an adult has very low requirements, but no one has really--

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 bad experiments suggest that maybe just an ounce or two would be safe,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 and gelatin, which lacks those amino acids, is safe in very large amounts.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 So poor people who eat the tough bits of the animal, chicken feet and wings and such,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 are getting much more gelatin than the rich people who eat the tender steaks.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Okay. Okay, well, it is 734, and I know the engineer had a question,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 so let's pass it over to the engineer.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 When you were talking about the red light versus healing the damage from the ultraviolet,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 one question is, say, is natural sunlight a better thing to tan by than the tanning beds?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 Yeah, because you're absorbing all the way through your body from sunlight,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 and it's doing many-- it increases your energy all the way through your body,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 your liver and brain, everything is being refreshed and renewed,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 and any sunburn that develops from staying in the sunlight too long,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 your skin oozes these inflammatory mediators into your bloodstream

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 and causes-- some people get a fever and feel sick if they stay in the sun too long.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 But the general saturation with the red light is protecting you to a great extent

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 against that systemic bystander stuff seeping out of the damaged skin.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 And is near infrared beneficial too, so say, sitting by a wood stove?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 Well, it mostly just warms you, and keeping your temperature up to close to 99 degrees,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 that activates your respiration and all of the protective processes.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 So I think its main value is helping to keep your core body temperature up where it should be.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 Thank you, and bye-bye, and to Robin.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 Okay, so yeah, we've gone past the 730 points,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 so if people would like to call in this month with any questions

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 related or unrelated to the effects of radiation,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 or any other questions they may have, please feel free to call the numbers 923 3911,

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 or if you are outside the 923 area code, there's a toll-free number,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 and it's 800 KMUD RAD, which is 800 568 3723.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 Okay, so to continue with the topic of radiation,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 radiation's effect is neither instantaneous,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 it's neither apparent nor instantaneous, and can linger for many generations.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 So the... I think the lights are flashing, actually,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 I don't know if there is a call that will take it, otherwise we'll carry on.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 Is there? I think someone may be actually giving a question to the engineer.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 Okay, so the fact that the effects of radiation are not perceived instantaneously

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 is a bit of a worry, because most people will be told that something is safe,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 and most people will follow it like...

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 And many of the experiments that measure the dangers of radiation

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 just look at a very short time span,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 and then they throw the animals away if they didn't get sick or die from the radiation,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 but any meaningful experiment would have to follow those exposed animals' offspring for generations.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 Yeah, definitely.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 We do actually have two callers, Dr. Peat, so let's see what our first caller has to...

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 The first caller wanted me to ask for them.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 So if you're familiar, Dr. Peat, with grow lights, by any chance?

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Grow lights?

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 Lights for growing plants.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 Yes.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Yes, so what are the benefits of those?

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 And she was asking specifically about grow, but I would like to ask...

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 Well, the red fraction is used for making energy

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 as well as for protecting against the irritating higher energy frequencies,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 but if you grow--most plants, if you grow them under pure red light,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 they'll grow extremely fast, but they'll be very weak, and they tend to fall over.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 Just because they need some of the irritation to build the cellulose skeleton for strength.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 So the typical grow light has red, blue, and a little either ultraviolet or at least blue and violet

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 to irritate the cells enough that they produce cellulose for strength.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 Okay.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 Go on. Sorry.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 The irritating frequencies tend to make crops rich in certain defensive chemicals,

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 and so for food crops, it makes them tend to be bitter,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 but those defensive substances in the plants are very often antioxidants for humans.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 Okay. That's interesting.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Okay. We do actually have a few callers on the line, so let's take the next caller.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 Hello?

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 Hi. You're on the air.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 Thanks a lot. Thanks, Dr. Peat. I love--I'm really--I just love listening to you.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 I have one comment and a question.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 My comment is I just had a bunch of dental x-rays,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 and then two days later, my back got really inflamed,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 so I was very interested to hear what you had to say, that things--you could be irradiated in one place,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 and then it could cause inflammation in a different area.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 Yeah. Just a few years ago, a study in Seattle was measuring the responses to standard dental x-rays,

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 and they were putting on lead aprons to shield the person's body from the chin down,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 and women who were pregnant at the time they got a set of mouth x-rays had smaller babies

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 than the women who weren't exposed to x-rays, even though the baby was shielded.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 It was the systemic stress or estrogen-like effect that caused even the embryo to grow at a slower rate.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 Oh. Well, my other--my question was about serotonin and this estrogen thing.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 I have been taking Prozac for more than 20 years,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 and I don't really see that it does anything for me anymore

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 and would like to get off of it, but it's about--they always say the serotonin thing is what you need and so on,

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 and I only take it every other day, but still, I'm very concerned about--I'd like to quit taking it,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 and I was just wondering what that's doing to my body all these years.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 There have been several studies in which when thyroid is added to the antidepressants,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 when the antidepressant isn't working, it works when they add thyroid,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 but the drug companies never test the thyroid by itself because that wouldn't sell their product,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 but they can make several of the antidepressants work better just by adding thyroid.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 They talk about the generations of antidepressants.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 In the '50s, it was the mono-amino oxidase inhibitors.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 Then those patents expired, and the drug companies said,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 "Well, those turn out to be toxic, but we now have the tricyclic antidepressants,"

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 and for 17 or so years, those were the good things,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 but it turned out that they increase prolactin, which has many harmful effects like bone loss and so on,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 and now they were replaced by the so-called serotonin reuptake inhibitors,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 but serotonin is now turning out to cause bone loss too by raising prolactin just the way the older ones did,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 and some comparative studies have found that the old 1950s style is actually safer than some of the newer ones.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 Oh, my goodness.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 So my question is then, is just taking something for thyroid, is that a better way to go?

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 Well, that would be my choice.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 Some of these so-called serotonin reuptake inhibitors are actually promoting adrenaline and dopamine at the same time,

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 but they don't emphasize that,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 and one of the most interesting recent antidepressants actually has the opposite effect.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 It increases the reuptake of serotonin, just the opposite of the currently popular ones,

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 and it is very effective for many people as an antidepressant.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 Well, thank you so much. This is really very interesting.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 I worked in brain research for many years, and I quit about 20 years ago,

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 but I'm very interested in what you're doing. Thank you so much.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 Thank you for your call, yeah.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 Okay, there's two more callers on the line, so next caller. You're on the air?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 Yes, Dr. Peat.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 Can you hear me?

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 Yes.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 Yes, I am a 64-year-old woman with 100-year-old bones.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 I've kept them that way for approximately 12 years,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 and I'm now doing Forteo injections for approximately three months,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 and I've been given 17 x-rays in this last one week because of the pain level from previous injuries.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 I'm headed for an MRI and a CT scan.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 I've had hepatitis C for 16 years and kept it at level two.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 Can you tell me what possible effects could all this have on me in the future as far as the MRI and the CT scan,

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 which I have not done yet?

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 I couldn't hear part of that. Andrew or Sarah, could you summarize it?

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 Yeah, go ahead.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 The woman has had, I believe, 17 x-rays.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 In the past week.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 In the past week, and she's headed for an MRI and a CAT scan, and she's wondering...

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 I have 100-year-old bones and I've been injecting Forteo for three months.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 I didn't hear that last part, actually. What was the last thing you said?

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 What's the name of the drug?

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 Forteo. It's an injection for bones.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 Okay.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 And I've been doing that for three months. I have hepatitis C for 16 years.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 I'm in stage two.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 Okay. All right, Dr. Peat, can you hear us now?

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 Yeah.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 Okay. I think the lady's main concern is what can she do to strengthen her bones.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 She says she has 100-year-old bones and she's only in her 60s.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 Oh, well, probably the safest, most effective thing is, besides getting lots of calcium in your diet

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 and adequate magnesium, vitamin K is very safe and it complements vitamin D and calcium.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 And since exposure to radiation, one of the first things it does as it knocks down the energy production,

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 it causes cells to take up too much calcium into the soft tissue.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 And that's what Goffman demonstrated, that a tremendous amount of heart disease

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 and arterial disease is being caused by radiation exposure.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 The calcium goes into your soft tissue rather than the bones.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 And vitamin K is safe at much larger doses than have been traditional,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 and it can actually reverse the calcification of arteries while greatly accelerating the growth or repair of bones

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 and their uptake and retention of calcium.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 Okay, good.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 And would that replace the Forteo?

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 What was that?

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 Would that replace the Forteo injections?

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 I can't hear it clearly.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 The lady's asking whether or not what you've suggested there would replace the current injections

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 that she's been having or is about to have.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 Well, vitamin K is very important for energy production as well as for calcium deposition.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 And I didn't hear what the current injections were.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 Well, she said Forteo.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000
 I think that's what they call it.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 Forteo injections.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 Oh, is that a bisphosphonate?

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 I inject it once a day.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 But do you know-- Dr. Peat's asking is it a bisphosphonate?

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 No, I don't believe so.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 Okay.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 I think until we know what the drug is, it's difficult to be able to discuss it.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 Okay, okay.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 I'm sorry.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 But vitamin K, calcium, and vitamin D are the most important things that Dr. Peat was mentioning for your bone strength.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 Right.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 And to get your thyroid checked.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 And obviously make sure your thyroid's working optimally.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 That will certainly help.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000
 Right.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 Okay, now the herbs for pain level.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 Now, I haven't taken any prescription drugs in quite some time.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 And the doctor gave me Valium to take.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 I do not like it.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 I replaced that with valerian root.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 Okay.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 Okay.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 What can I replace for blood pressure medicine?

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 Okay, so you have high blood pressure, huh?

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 Only on occasions.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 Only on occasions, okay.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 Well, I mean, there are traditional-- the traditional herbs for blood pressure are things like hawthorn, hawthorn flowers and berries.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 They have a cardioactive effect to lower blood pressure and to decrease the-- increase the force of contraction but decrease the rate.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 So that's kind of primary number one, cardiotonic.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 There are several other, you know, obviously things that reduce your stress will certainly have a potential benefit for high blood pressure because stress will increase adrenaline.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 Adrenaline will drive up blood pressure.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 But hawthorns, the nurse of the heart, that's always what they--

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 And the valerian should help as well.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
 Yeah, the valerian should do.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 Even if you have hepatitis C.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 And the calcium and vitamin K should help blood pressure.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 Yeah, okay.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 And as for the hepatitis, I think what the most-- I think the most important thing for the hepatitis is to avoid polyunsaturated fats.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:19.000
 Certainly, they have been majorly implicated in causing inflammation and inflammation is not what you want with hepatitis.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 There's plenty of other things but they're mainly going to be dietary factors so increasing your gelatin consumption, making sure that you get good proteins from a mixed range.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 Okay. And I have the information on the Forteo.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 Okay.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 It's T-E-R-I-P-A-R-A-T-I-D-E.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 Hmm.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 Parenthesis.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000
 I've not heard of it.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 R-E-N-A origin.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 Yeah, I haven't heard of it.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 Oh, okay.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 I'm sorry but we do have two more callers so I would like to--

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 Okay, thank you very much for your help.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 Yeah, you're very welcome.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 You've been a wonderful help.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 You're very welcome.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
 Thank you so much.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 Okay, the other callers on the line, you're on the air.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 Hi, I have a--

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 My next?

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 I can't hear you so--

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 I have a question about non-ionizing radiation.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 Okay.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 I've read that they didn't used to think that that actually caused cellular damage and DNA breakage

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 but that more recent research is showing that non-ionizing radiation can cause these problems too

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 and I'm concerned about this with regards to the new PG&E smart meters and all the Wi-Fi that's being installed.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 Can you comment on that?

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 Okay, Toshki?

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 Yeah, some of the electromagnetic low, relatively low energy radiation can still break chromosomes.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 It's a matter of how they resonate and for example, men working around power lines have very few male offspring

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 and birds living near those same power lines have almost purely female offspring

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:29.000
 because of the apparently cellular and chromosome damage from those pretty low energy, low frequency emissions.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 Do you know anything about the frequencies that the microwave range of the frequencies that smart meters and Wi-Fi emit in particular?

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:44.000
 Well, I've got a gauge that I check my things with.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 I went to a flat screen monitor years ago and have only wire connections

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:59.000
 because of the known effect on the brain for example.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 Way back in the 50s, the Russians were lowering their safety standards for that type of radiation

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 because of the effect for example on inheritance, lowering fertility.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:25.000
 Do you recommend people just buy an EMF meter and check their electrical appliances?

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 Yeah, I think they cost about $20 and I just got a new microwave oven

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 and it has really intense fields out about two feet away from it.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:42.000
 So even with the new ovens, it's good to stand back three or four feet at least.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 I think just to answer the other question about the microwave Wi-Fi,

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 I think wherever possible if you have a microwave internet, you can just hardwire your connection to your computers.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 You don't have to have your house bathed in Wi-Fi signals.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 We're going to be attached to our houses and they're going to bathe their houses in it and we don't get a choice about it.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 So that's what I was concerned.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 Yeah. Okay, well I'm not too sure about that but we do have seven more callers.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 Buy a field meter and check a smart meter.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 Okay, we've got three more callers. I'm not sure how many we'll get through but let's take the next caller.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000
 Hi, my question is actually pretty simple.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:41.000
 On the serotonin stuff, I take a supplement called 5-HTP.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:47.000
 Does that fall in the benign or bad category?

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.000
 Many of its effects are essentially the same as serotonin.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 So that's inflammatory?

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 Yeah.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 It's inflammatory?

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 Yeah, the same effects. 5-HTP or 5-hydroxytryptophan has got the same negative effects that serotonin does and that is that it's inflammatory.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 Serotonin, for example, stimulates cell growth and inflammation.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 It can increase the growth of plaques in arteries and accelerate tumor growth and so on.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 And tryptophan, which isn't quite as active as the 5-hydroxy, tryptophan itself is considered to be slightly carcinogenic in excess.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 Well, that's odd. I've actually been struggling with healing tendons and taking this at the same time.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000
 So perhaps I've been shooting myself in the foot.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
 Thanks so much.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 And to that caller who was just on, who's just left the air, the tendons, certainly one of the best things that you should be doing for tendons is one of Dr. Peat's recommendations of a bone broth or gelatin broth from bone shanks.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 And gelatin is an extremely protective anti-inflammatory and the components of which are utilized in the formation of tendons and the protective material around joints.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 Okay, there's another caller on the line.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 Hi, Dr. Roy, I talked to you this morning. My name's Chris and I was curious if the good doctor would know, I'm currently looking to lose weight and I was wondering, is there any meat that's any better than any other meat out there?

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 I think avoiding the pork and the non-ruminants because those reflect whatever they ate and are usually highly unsaturated and anti-thyroid.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000
 So instead of chicken and pork, beef and lamb?

00:56:52.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 Yeah, beef and lamb are saturated. Coconut oil is a vegetable oil which is highly saturated and so it promotes metabolism, increases calories.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 You don't recommend turkey?

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000
 Turkey usually eats the same stuff chickens and pigs do, corn and soybeans.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 Okay, well thank you so much.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:23.000
 Okay, you're very welcome. Okay, well I think we should hold the callers there. I know there's more on the line but I'm sorry we don't have the time this month.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 We do have a few minutes, however, to thank Dr. Peat very much for his time. I really appreciate you taking time out of your day just to share what you have.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 I know a lot of people that listen in this area particularly are very, very interested and what you have to say is very researched, it's scientific, it's not quackery, it's not suspect.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 It's all out there, you know, you can find it. For those people that want to hear, you know, what you're saying is very well researched and we thank you so much for helping.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:58:06.000
 It is December now and just a by-product of December's 21st full lunar eclipse, folks, if you get a chance to see it at about 11 o'clock, 70 minutes long.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
 Okay, Sarah, do you have anything else you'd like to say?

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 No, just I want to make sure you hand out Dr. Peat's contact details.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 That's right, that was the very next thing, of course.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
 Make sure it's .com.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:26.000
 Anybody who wants to find out more about Dr. Raymond Peat, his website is www.repeat.com and he's got many fully referenced articles.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.000
 He's been doing this for many, many years and has a wealth of information.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 So if people would like to read his material, then that certainly would be the first step in greater understanding.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000
 I also want to let people know that these radio shows are archived.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:51.000
 Everything that KMUD puts out on the air, including Marky Mark's couple of hours that come next every time we're on our show, everything's archived.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:59.000
 So if you want to go to Friday Night Live, you'll find the show there and you can go ahead and download it, listen to it.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:08.000
 I would suggest for those people who are interested in what Dr. Peat has said before, and obviously some were listening again this evening and got much more out of it,

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000
 then they could burn these CDs, if that's a legal or non-legal term,

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000
 they could use these CDs and listen to them and really start to digest what he's saying.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:25.000
 OK, so thanks so much for all of you who listen regularly and for those of you who tuned in this evening as well.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:31.000
 We'll see you next year. Happy Christmas, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
 Thank you for listening.

 Support for KMUD comes in part from the Stonery in Garberville.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:56.000
 The Stonery, fine jewelry for men and women, now can be found locally in our area.

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000
 The Stonery is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday 10 to 4.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
 Also, support for KMUD comes in part from Lavender Head Farms.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000
 They would like to send a very warm thanks for your support for Lavender Head Hand Cleaner.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
 They wish you love and happiness throughout the holidays and in every moment.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
