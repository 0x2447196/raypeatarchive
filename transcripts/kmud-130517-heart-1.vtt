00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Hi and welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Well, this month is a slightly different format.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 We had a baby last month, a beautiful baby girl.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 And my wife, who normally joins us on the show, and who's my right hand, right hand leader, male.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 She's not with me.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 So, we're going to run the show tonight with Dr. Peat,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 and he's going to share his wisdom on the subject of heart failure and hormones and other subjects surrounding that.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 As usual, people can and are invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's show on heart failure and hormones.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 And as usual, there's an ever-growing Ray Peat Facebook fan page,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 and we get emails from all over the states from people that are following him.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 And always very good to hear anecdotal evidence of people improving fairly drastically,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 making the changes that he's been advocating for probably the last 20-something years.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 I know he's been studying and researching probably for 35, nearly 40.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 So, okay, the thrust of the show, like I said, is heart failure,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 although there is going to be hopefully some time to look at new research surrounding the understanding of cancer

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 and metastases in relation to solid tumors and the way the body recruits collagen as part of the event

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 that leads to a fairly poor prognosis with some cancer diagnosis.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 So, for those who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists and trained in England there, graduating with a master's degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 And we run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 So, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you are invited to call in with any questions,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's subject of the heart and hormones.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 The number, if you live in the area, is 923-3911.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Or, if you live outside the area, there's a toll-free number you can reach us on, and that's 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Incidentally, we can also be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBM-HERB for any further information or consultations

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 after the show, basically, during working hours, Monday through Friday.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 So, anyway, welcome all of you who are listening, and welcome to you, Dr. Peat.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Hi.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 Okay, so, as usual, we do get callers every month,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 and indeed people emailing every month who perhaps have never heard of you

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 and are very interested to hear what you have to say.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 I think a lot of the time, people, new listeners, hear what you have to say.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 It seems to be fairly shocking in terms of it seems to go against the grain of everything we're told

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 from the medical community and by doctors, if you like, to carte blanche cover them as a title.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 But I know you have some very different views and research that you've used and proven with your own approach,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 a very different treatment outline for people that have very wide-ranging conditions,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 ranging from degenerative to endocrine and metabolic.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 So, would you, for the benefit, perhaps, of people who've never heard of you and who've tuned in tonight,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 just give us an outline of your academic and professional career?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 From 1968 to '72, I was in graduate school at the University of Oregon,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 and I did my dissertation on reproductive aging and how oxidative metabolism changes with age.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 And I found that the changes that happen causing basically the menopause equivalent in animals

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 is something that happens in every tissue in the body.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 It just happens that in the uterus is where I did my dissertation work,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 I was interested in aging changes in the brain and bones and so on.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 And it turns out that the same chemical and biological processes change through time in all of these tissues.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 And in my dissertation, one of the aging theories that I talked about was the collagen theory of aging

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 and that estrogen excess causes wastage of oxygen, basically suffocating tissues,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 the way radiation would, for example, and destroying the ability to use oxygen.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 And as a result of that, excess collagen is produced by the collagen-producing cells, fibroblasts,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 in the connective tissue.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 And with aging, the collagen becomes progressively denser and more cross-linked,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 creating an oxygen-deprived environment.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 My emphasis at that time was on how estrogen produced by irritation or aging causes more collagen to be produced

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 and to become more dense, creating further interference with oxygen consumption.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Okay.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Well, surrounding the talk for tonight and the recent article that you've written,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 that's fully referenced for people who might perhaps want to explore getting a copy of it,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 the situation concerning congestive heart failure, that roughly 5.7 million people in the U.S.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 are suffering from congestive heart failure.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 And its physiology is particularly relevant to tonight's show,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 as it's a feature of a defective function of heart muscle itself.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Would you explain to our listeners the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 so that they can understand what it is the disease entails?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 And then we'll get into some of the mechanisms by which that can be changed

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 and how people can see a better way of treating their bodies and eating the right foods, et cetera.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 In congestive heart failure, the heart muscle simply gets weaker,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 less able to pump a full volume of blood with each stroke.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 And the diastolic phase, which should be a relaxation phase, is inadequate.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 The heart stays partly contracted, so it has a short stroke.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 And to make up for the shortness of the stroke, it tends to pump faster.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 And ordinarily, when a heart muscle pumps faster, it has a bigger stroke

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 so that it doesn't have to simply increase the speed.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 It can increase the volume with each stroke.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 But with heart failure, that's impossible.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 So it tends to lead to a fast but weak heartbeat.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Okay. And the actual muscle of the heart itself becomes more flabby and weak?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 Well, it becomes waterlogged, a higher concentration of water in the tissue.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 That's because it isn't relaxing fully.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 And when it doesn't relax, it's like when you work a muscle tremendously.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 You can actually make a muscle swell up in just 15 or 20 minutes of very intense contraction.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Your muscle will gain weight because it doesn't relax fully and retains calcium and excess water.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 So a very fatigued biceps muscle, for example,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 is temporarily equivalent to what's happening in a failing heart.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 And with that condition of retaining water and calcium, if that persists for a long time,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 because the heart isn't getting enough sugar or oxygen, whatever it needs to relax,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 or if it's being stimulated by estrogen, for example, that prevents the full relaxation,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 then chronically it tends to produce more collagen, and that collagen tends to become hardened.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 So at first it's just a swollen condition, then it gradually becomes a fibrotic condition,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 and that can actually lead to the development of a bone in the heart,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 which is a calcification that actually contains crystalline calcium.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 Got it.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Okay, because I understood the basic mechanism of treatment at least 20 years ago to be things like diuretics.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 And this would be in part the removal of excess water that you mentioned

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 is a feature of congestive heart failure in the muscle.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Even plant derivatives like digoxin from the Wooley Foxglove as a strengthener of heart contractions

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 so that each contraction was more effective.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Yeah, that steroid from the Foxglove is similar in structure and function to progesterone.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Wow, really?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 And St. George did experiments 50 or 60 years ago in which he showed that progesterone acts on the heart using a rabbit heart.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 It acts like digitalis to increase the staircase effect of heart contraction

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 in which a faster stimulation increases the stroke and amount of blood pumped with each contraction.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 And that's because the progesterone or the digitalis is accelerating the ability to both contract and relax.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 Okay, because it's as much in part the relaxation that's the important phase of muscle contraction

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 for the next contraction to be important, the next contraction to be functional.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Yeah, that's why the failing heart has a very weak small beat because it isn't relaxed

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 and it's becoming harder just by being filled up with water.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 The way your muscles, when they swell up, they feel harder.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 Okay, okay. And I'm very fatigued from that swelling.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Okay, so you mentioned this staircase effect and it's the first time I've come across that as a statement.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 Because I always believed that the increasing contractions of the heart were a kind of mechanism

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 to compensate for the lack of blood volume being ejected with each contraction in the failing heart,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 at least in things like arrhythmia and tachycardia which are part of a congestive heart failure type picture, aren't they?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 When you're exercising, you will notice the beats per minute increase as you use your muscles and consume more oxygen.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 But at the same time that your healthy heart is beating faster, it's beating harder.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 So when it's going maybe 130 beats per minute, it will also be something very hard.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 Okay.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 And you can feel your pulse in your wrist or throat as a big, bulging throb with each beat.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 That's the staircase effect. It's both going faster and having a bigger stroke with each contraction.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Right, now that's efficient. That's an efficient contraction.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Okay. All right.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 You're listening to Ask Your Arb Doctor on KMUD Garboville, 91.1 FM and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 You're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of the heart and hormones.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 We're joined by Dr. Raymond Peat, who has about 40 years of expertise in research into cell physiology, particularly with hormones.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923-3911 or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 So I think the next question I wanted to ask was you're explaining the waterlogged effect of cardiac muscles and congestive heart failure.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 This has a relationship to growing pains, doesn't it?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 And I think you've got a very different way of looking at growing pains or the treatment of growing pains.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Yeah. It turns out that exactly the same things are happening in skeletal muscle and heart muscle.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 People have known it empirically.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 Doctors have seen the changes in their patients for 100 years and found that thyroid would correct those problems of both the heart and the skeletal muscles.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 But now fairly recently with analysis of the genes and proteins, you can see that in fact exactly the same things are involved in the growing pains,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 which come with somewhat low thyroid function around puberty, usually a couple of years before puberty.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Estrogen is increasing blocking thyroid function.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 That makes the cell fatigue more easily so it retains water.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 The pain that's associated with usually in the late afternoon and evening of the muscles have progressively retained more water and calcium.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Got it.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 And they're painful and swollen.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 And if a person in middle age becomes very hypothyroid, they start getting the same thing.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 Fibromyalgia is one of the variations on that.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 I was just going to ask.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 The muscle disease of hypothyroidism or hypothyroid myopathy involves leakage of enzymes from the skeletal muscles.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 That has been the assumption.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 But in fact, the heart is also leaking those proteins.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 You can identify proteins coming from both the heart muscle and the skeletal muscles in the hypothyroidism or in heart failure.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 So you can pick these up in the blood then?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 Yeah, and urine.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 And the urine.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Interesting.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Okay.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 So somebody perhaps if they were suspecting from having a lot of fatigue in their arms and legs and/or their back muscles just from standing erect,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 might suppose they got a diagnosis of, gosh, words have gone out of my head, the fibromyalgia.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 Sorry.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 So could that be tested in a lab if they were to give a urine sample or blood sample?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 Would they be able to find myoglobin, for example, from the heart?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 Yeah, creatine kinase is the first thing to look for if you're suspecting a thyroid-related pain problem.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Creatine kinase.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Okay.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 All right.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 So hypothyroidism, because I think the two terms get interchangeably confused both with patients and doctors.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Some people would say they have hypothyroidism and they actually may have the opposite and vice versa.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 So people who say they're hyperthyroid may just have very high adrenaline states and actually be low thyroid.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 So how do you understand the myopathy, the muscle weakness in hypothyroidism again?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 In hypothyroidism, you can see it in an electrocardiogram or if you kneel and have someone thump your Achilles tendon

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 so your toes twitch away from your body, the relaxation, if your thyroid function is good,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 the relaxation will be instantaneous and your foot will relax with a floppy, instantaneous, complete relaxation.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 If your thyroid is low, it will come back slowly to exactly where it started.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 And the heart is doing the same thing with a prolongation of the QT interval.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 The T wave represents repolarization or relaxation.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Okay.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 So you can see it in either thumping your Achilles tendon or looking at the electrocardiogram.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 And when that is slow, that means the cell is retaining water and calcium.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 And in that swollen state, it is permeable.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 It absorbs things that it shouldn't and it leaks some of the enzymes that it shouldn't leak.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 So you can see those in the blood during fatigue or hypothyroidism.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 Okay.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 Is this related perhaps to -- and it's a little bit off the beaten track here with where we're going --

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 but the reflexes, someone's reflexes in general, if somebody has very quick reflexes

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 and they seem to be very alert and sharp,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 is that reflex down to being able to also relax the muscle that's spasming or producing that reflex quickly?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Is that a sign of a fairly well-functioning thyroid?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Yes.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 The conduction in time, the rates of nervous conduction is slowed in hypothyroidism.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Right.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 And so there are different things involved in ordinary functioning.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 A hypothyroid person will tend to react over 10 milliseconds or 20 milliseconds slower

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 than a person with a good thyroid function.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 I've seen when someone popped a firecracker on the Fourth of July, I saw people around the room.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 There was sort of a wave of jumping.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 You could tell who the hypothyroid people were by how fast they jumped.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 Okay.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Interesting.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 I think it would be interesting for people that are listening just to go over again the Achilles tendon reflex

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 because it's not something -- when we were studying, it was always a patella reflex.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 You'd sit on a stool with your legs swinging like you're an eight-year-old or whatever on a grown-up chair.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 So your legs were swinging, and then it would hit your patella with a little rubber patella hammer,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 and your reflex would initiate in however far your leg swung out and return to normal.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 That shows the extent of the reflex ability, but it doesn't show the speed of relaxation

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 because your lower leg is so heavy.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 It'll swing back if your muscle is only partly relaxed.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 But when you kneel, the calf muscle is very big in relation to the small weight of your toes.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 When that muscle contracts, it's the muscle that makes you able to stand on your toes, so it's a very strong muscle.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 But when you're kneeling, all it has to do is make your foot twitch a little bit.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 So the return from the twitch is a very small burden on the muscle,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 so it won't drag a half-contracted muscle back to resting position.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 It comes back exactly as the muscle reaches full relaxation.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 Excellent. Okay, so those people that are listening,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 if they ever wanted to do it themselves to purely test their own reflexes and their thyroid state,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 what Dr. Peat is talking about is if you were to kneel on a chair, facing the back of the chair,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 so your legs are off the chair, and basically have your leg just nice and relaxed and floppy,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 then someone behind you gets a rolling pin or something like that kind of nature

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 and just gently taps with a quick tap your Achilles tendon, which runs from your heel up into your calf.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 And tapping that tendon then will elicit a reflex, so your foot will swing out away from you,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 and it's how quickly it returns to its resting state where the toes are pointing down to the floor again.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 It's that resting repolarization that's the important marker of how well your thyroid is working.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 If your toes, they swing out, but they take a long time to return,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 they kind of gently swing back down to perpendicular, then that's not a very good sign.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 And if they swing out and back down again quickly, that's actually the good sign you're looking for.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Okay, so maybe somebody can help you out there if you want to try this yourself at home.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMUD Garville, 91.1 FM,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 and from 7.30, which is coming up here in five minutes or so, until the end of the show, 8 o'clock,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of the heart and hormones.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 3911, or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1800-KMUD-RAD.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 And we're very pleased to welcome Dr. Raymond Peat onto the show once again to share his wisdom with us.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 Another way of looking at that reflex system is insomnia.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 Many doctors think that thyroid is a stimulant that will make you stay awake,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 but when you think of the brain as having exactly the same process of excitation and relaxation as your heart muscle or your leg muscle,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 when the brain is fatigued, if it's somewhat hypothyroid, it gets the equivalent of a growing pain or a cramp,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 and it can't relax fully, and that amounts to insomnia.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 And so if you can energize the brain cells, you can get sleep to come on quickly,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 and the active thyroid hormone and magnesium and sugar are the things that most quickly will restore energy to your brain or your muscles, heart, and so on.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 Okay, did you have a question?

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 Yeah, somebody already wanted to know the best foods for the heart, the best diet.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 Yeah. Dr. Peat?

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 Well, fruit is extremely important, and avoiding polyunsaturated fats,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 because the heart is much more efficient using oxygen when it's burning sugar rather than fat,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 and having plenty of all of the minerals, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium, those interact very closely.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 People think of calcium as the exciting ion, which it is when the cell is excited and can't get rid of it,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 but calcium happens to inhibit some of the hormones that maintain inflammation and excitation.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 So if you are well saturated with all of these minerals, the alkaline minerals,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 that will help the heart to relax more quickly and then contract more quickly.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 Okay, you said calcium, potassium, magnesium?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 And sodium.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 Sodium, okay. So things like eggshells from the calcium, or milk, obviously is another very good source of calcium,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 and then potassium and magnesium, and these are fairly rich in green leafy vegetables.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 And fruits, orange juice and watermelon, for example, are good for the sodium and potassium.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Yeah, there you go. And obviously table salt. I know we've done several shows on salt and how good it is for you,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 but I think we need to keep reminding ourselves again that there's absolutely no truth in the fact that salt is harmful.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 It's actually very beneficial for you, and actually lack of salt is more harmful.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 I'm pretty surprised. The last couple of months, I look at the news, the BBC news,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 probably because I'm British of descent, and tend to think of the BBC as a kind of non-biased, non-corporate news entity,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 and it doesn't really have any funding one way or the other from parties and corporations, et cetera.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 But I found some very interesting health articles that have come out of there that have really corroborated what you've been talking about,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 and I was almost going to point out several of these towards the end of the show.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 Okay, so it's 7.30, and I don't know if I've got to go ahead.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 One point about the sodium is that if you restrict sodium, you increase your aldosterone,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 and one of the current interests in heart drug treatment is to find an aldosterone inhibitor,

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 but eating enough sodium is the simplest way to inhibit excess aldosterone.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 It's too cheap, and they can't patent it, Dr. Peat.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 I found the same thing about one of the BBC articles was just showing,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 it was a complete reversal over the last 20 years or so of doctrine from the medical profession, if you like,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 on skin cancer and melanomas and exposure to sun, and now in England,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 they're actually promoting people to go out and get more sun,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 because they're saying that the vitamin D deficiency causing rickets is actually on the rise,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 and actually there's very little evidence now to suggest that sun exposure causes melanoma,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 and it's actually related to many other things, most of which are probably polyunsaturates in the diet.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 There have been a couple of studies in which they found, in fact,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 that the incidence of melanoma decreased with the altitude at which a person lives,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 and so it's inversely related to ultraviolet light exposure.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 Okay, we've got a caller on the line, so let's take this next caller.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 Hello, you're on the air?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 Hello, you're on the air. Hi.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 I have a question that isn't exactly about the heart, but--

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 Could I first start by asking you where you're from, where you're calling from?

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 I am living in Phillipsville. Okay.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 Spoken over the phone. Okay, very good.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 My father actually died of a heart attack, and I am--

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 because he had psoriasis of his toenails, too, and since I learned from Dr. Peat that estrogen can cause heart attacks,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 I kind of feel like that's what happened with him.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 But me, what happens with me is that I have a grand mal seizure once a month,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 and it's what's known as catamenial epilepsy because of this out-of-whack ratio between estrogen and progesterone.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 I am slightly derailing you, but I'm taking this opportunity to actually speak to Dr. Peat.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 Please do.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 Go ahead. What was your question?

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 Well, I'm wondering, like, what can I do to balance my hormones?

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 Keeping your cholesterol level up, fruit is one of the best ways to help the liver make enough cholesterol.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 And then if your cholesterol production is good, thyroid and vitamin A are the main things for turning cholesterol into progesterone,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 which not only has anti-seizure effects, but it has heart-protective effects,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 steadying the heart rhythm the way that digitalis does, and blocking albosterone, preventing fibrosis of the heart, and so on.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 So keeping your cholesterol production up but having the factors that convert it to progesterone is basically --

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Is that something that's operative in the gut, like eating the raw grated carrot?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Is it vitamin A?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 The effect of having a raw carrot every day or bamboo shoots, these are antiseptic fibers which can't be easily broken down by microorganisms.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 And so they don't stimulate bacterial growth, in fact, tend to sterilize the intestine.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 At the same time, the fiber binds the estrogen which your liver is producing and excreting all the time in the bile

00:32:46.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 and prevents it from being reabsorbed so immediately you can see a decrease in your estrogen level a day or two after eating a raw carrot.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 And that reduction of absorption of bacterial products and estrogen very quickly reduces your stress and cortisol production,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 and that allows your progesterone to increase.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 Okay.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 So you're talking about these things that are like the good and bad bacteria in the gut,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 and I wonder even if you know about the GAPS diet.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 Yeah, the simplest thing is to avoid starches and polyunsaturated fat because those are the things that promote --

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 Do you have olive oil then, like as something to avoid?

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 Well, the olive oil is saturated enough that it helps the carrot with the germicidal action.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Coconut oil, butter, and olive oil, especially associated with the fiber of carrot, help to suppress microorganisms.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 Okay.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 Okay.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 I think we'd better leave it for other callers.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 I appreciate your calling in, and I would better take the next caller.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Thank you.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 You're welcome.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 Hi, you're on the air?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Hello?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 Yes, hi.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 This is -- I'm sorry, what was that?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 Where are you from?

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 Where are you calling from?

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 Oh, I'm calling in from Minnesota.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 Okay.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 I'm just trying to make a habit of calling people and asking them where they're from just to get an idea of the demographics of the radio show's reach.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Oh, gotcha.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Thank you for calling.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 What's your question?

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 Yeah.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 Well, this is probably sort of off topic, but I was wondering Dr. Peate's opinion on what can a person do to recover from getting off of SSRIs?

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 Oh, I hear that a lot, and basically it's doing everything you can to restore a good, intense metabolic rate, restore the energy level of cells so that they don't go into the stress state.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 The high serotonin trains the nervous system to stay in a stress state because serotonin activates the pituitary, ACTH, and adrenal system.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 And ultimately the way to break that pattern is to increase your cellular energy production, lower stress, keep your thyroid function up, and keep the estrogen down.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 Okay.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 Well, thank you very much.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 I guess it sounds somewhat easy, but I'm sure it's pretty tough for someone who's been on SSRIs for so long.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 And is it something that takes quite a long time to recover from, in your opinion?

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 Yeah, people seem to take about a year to feel fairly normal again, even doing everything right.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 Okay. Well, thank you very much.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 Yeah, the serotonin itself creates an inflammatory state in the nerves and body in general.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 So they affect your whole metabolism, tend to increase fat production and stress, and so you want to concentrate on keeping your whole body in an unstressed condition.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 Eating frequently is probably one of the helpful things, not forcing yourself to go on adrenaline.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 Okay.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 All right. Thank you.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 I do appreciate you calling in and your interaction.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 We've got a couple of more callers, so let's just make sure everyone gets a chance to pose some questions to Dr. Peat.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 So next caller, you're on the air.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 Where are you from?

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 This is David from Missouri.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 Hi, David. Welcome to the show.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 And congratulations on your baby.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 Oh, thank you.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 You know, I don't know if you've seen this, but I see this quite often where somebody will put a cell phone in their pocket right over their heart.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 And I've heard that each organ in the body has a specific frequency, and I know that they all pretty much fall within the same frequency,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 but they do have a frequency that helps that system to operate normally.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 What do you think the ramifications are of having that competing frequency right next to the heart?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 It's pretty well established that you damage the tissue, create stress in the brain,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 the cancer rate increases when your head is exposed to the microwave frequencies.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Isn't it amazing that all of these mainstream media outlets, they never talk about things like that.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 You would think they would be warning people about putting a cell phone over their heart.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 But anyway, the other thing, I've been exploring eating bamboo sprouts.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 I grow several different types of bamboo.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 So this spring I've been trying different things, and I was just curious about the different techniques I've been using.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 You know, I've been steaming them like in a steamer basket, and then I've also just been boiling them in water.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 And I've noticed that how I peel that bamboo, I can leave more fibers that obviously are not digestible,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 but it seems like the more tender parts inside are really soft, I mean, almost like a really well-cooked potato.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 Do you think there's a benefit in maybe not cooking them too much?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 No, they still have good fiber, even if they're soft.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 And then I've also been drinking the water that I boil them in.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 Do you think there's actually some antibiotic material still in that water?

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 I think so. The Japanese and Chinese have some drugs that they make from extracts of the bamboo plant.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 And I think they get the strongest ones from the leaves,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 but I think there is the same antiseptic and probably anti-cancer material in the shoots.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 Wow. I'm going to harvest extra and then freeze them.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 I'm assuming that's not going to hurt it at all.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 I don't think it's hurting them.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 What?

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 I don't think it harms them to freeze.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 Okay. I don't want to hog the questions here, but I do have one more question,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 unless you think we should go on. I know we're running out of time.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 Go ahead, Matt. Go ahead.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 You know, the orange juice thing.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 I live in Missouri, and through the winter I can get fresh oranges.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 It's very difficult to get organic oranges,

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 but all through the winter I was juicing fresh oranges, and they were just regular oranges.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 It seems like I've heard that even though they're not organic,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 most oranges, because of that heavy peel, they're probably not too bad as far as pesticides.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 But as I'm going into summer, it's almost impossible for me to get fresh oranges.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 So I've been buying Tropicana orange juice,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 and I've been trying different organic frozen orange juices.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 And so I did a bunch of research on how all these frozen orange juices and things like Tropicana are made,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 and it seems like all of them are doing the same thing, where they create these big vats,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 and they take all the moisture out, and then they add the oil from the peel back in.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 Are you aware of that?

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 Yeah, and I think there's a worse process that all the big companies are using the last five or ten years,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 which is to use enzymes to break up the pulp so that they have less waste and more volume in the juice.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 The stuff that used to be pretty solid material that had to be discarded has now been--

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 I've heard you mention that before, and I've been calling these companies and trying to find one that, you know,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 it's really hard to find somebody to talk to that actually knows what's going on in these different companies,

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 but I have made an effort to do that.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 Like Tropicana says they do not do that in their non-pulp orange juice,

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 and I've called two of the organic ones, like Cascadian, and then--I forgot the other one,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 but they both say they're not doing that.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 So do you think that there is a benefit from drinking these processed orange juices?

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 Okay, so the fresh is definitely better, but drinking the processed ones are still going to be better than not doing it, right?

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 Yeah, for example, people with heart pains, even with frozen orange juice concentrate,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 you can see a very quick relief from mild heart pains just by drinking a pint of orange juice per day.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 Yeah, I'm addicted to orange juice now.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 It's amazing.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 It's a great addiction.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 I have a question for you since you're in Missouri.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 Yes.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 Is there a March Against Monsanto going in their home state?

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 There is, yeah.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 I'm going to it.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 I live close to a town called Springfield, and there's going to be a lot of people there,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 and there's one in St. Louis, which is where Monsanto is, and there's one in Columbia,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 which is where the University of Missouri is, and there's one in Kansas City.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 So, yeah, we're all wanting to make a stand on that for sure.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 Awesome.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 Thank you.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 All right.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 Thanks for your call, caller, and let's move on to the next one of two or however many.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 Just one more thing.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 Thank you, Dr. Peat, for everything you do, and thank you, Andrew, for the show.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 You're very welcome.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 Thanks for your call.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 Bye.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 Okay.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 I got a comment saying, "It's great.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 What a wide-ranging people."

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 I think I get more calls from farther away on this show than any other, and I did get a local call.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 It's all because of Dr. Peat.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 It's Dr. Peat.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 Yes.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 I got a local call, someone with information for the earlier person about SSRI.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 There's a website called drugawareness.com, and she had wanted to tell this to you and Sarah as well.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 Her name is Ann Blake Tracy, and she has a phone number, an 800 number, 800-280-0730,

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 and there's a lot of information about getting off SSRIs.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 Good.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 Excellent.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 And we have one more caller.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 Calling all the way from Miranda in Humboldt County.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Okay.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 You're not too far away.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 Okay.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 Welcome to the show.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 I hope my question won't be redundant.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 I missed part of the program driving home without a radio in my car.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 My question is I have chronic sinusitis that I've had for the last 10 years,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 and I have been lately feeling like it might be straining my heart,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 and I wondered if I've heard like you could have a minor chronic infection like, say, an abscessed tooth

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 or something like that.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 I think there is a definite relation between sinus or tooth infections in the heart,

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 but I don't think it goes from the sinus or tooth to the heart,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 but I think it's endotoxin from chronic intestinal inflammation.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 Sometimes bacteria enter the bloodstream along with the endotoxin,

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 but just the endotoxin alone is enough to cause sinusitis and inflamed periodontal tissues,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 and at the same time it's causing those changes in the heart, calcium retention, water retention,

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 easy fatigability.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 I get regular exercise, and I have a vegan diet,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 and I've been off gluten pretty strictly, very strictly for a couple of years now,

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 which is very helpful, but I can't seem to get ahead of the sinusitis.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 Anything that might pop up that I should...

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 When the simple foods and the fibers to disinfect your intestine, when those aren't enough,

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 then the drugs that are most helpful, in my experience, are aspirin and the antihistamines,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 Benadryl, for example, if you could get the pure chemical that's better than prepared tablets,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 and cyproheptadine, which is an antiserotonin antihistamine, and then antibiotics.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 I haven't responded to the antibiotics, and I don't use them very often,

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 but what about colloidal silver? I'm wondering about that.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 I tried that once, but I have the ability to make my own.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 One other thing that helps the general immune system and avoidance of inflammation is vitamin D.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 Have you had a blood test for vitamin D?

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 I haven't, but I take 10,000 units a day of vitamin D.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 I've got this drop here, and I take 10 of them, and it's supposed to come out to 10,000 units.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 Does that seem like a reasonable dosage?

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 Yeah, if it's vitamin D3.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 Yes, it is.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 Do you get sunlight exposure?

00:47:50.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 Yeah. My wife and I walk every day, and it hasn't been raining very much in Humboldt County, unfortunately.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 I don't on Sundays, though.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 Well, thank you. I think I should get off to leave room for anyone behind me.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 Okay, no problem.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 All right, well, thanks for your call.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 Thank you.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 I appreciate you calling in.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 Whilst we're on the topic, before the callers started coming in,

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 let me just give people who are listening again an opportunity to know how to get in contact with us.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 We can be reached here at 1-800-KMUD-RAD or the toll-free number, 923-3911.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 We were discussing cholesterol, you know.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 At the beginning of the call in questions, you were talking about the relationship of cholesterol

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:48.000
 and how this is relevant, the harmful effects, perhaps, rather, of lowering cholesterol

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 and its relevance to heart failure.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 Yeah, the drugs that lower cholesterol, one of the accepted side effects of both of the main categories

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 of cholesterol-lowering drugs is to cause occasional muscle breakdown,

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000
 rhabdomyolysis, the muscle dissolves itself.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 And one of the known things is the interference with the production of coenzyme Q10,

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 but that isn't the sole reason for the muscle breakdown.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:40.000
 The simple lack of cholesterol, cholesterol is a cell-stabilizing substance with hormone-like action,

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 which in the absence of progesterone and the other protective steroids,

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 it actually has a cell-protective effect in the skeletal muscles and in the heart.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 The same process that causes rhabdomyolysis of the skeletal muscles can happen in the heart,

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 cholesterol deficiency, tending to kill heart cells.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 There you go, you see.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 Dr. Peat, you recommend to have a cholesterol of 200,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.000
 but you don't have any problem with someone reporting a cholesterol of 200,

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 especially if they're 50 or more, do you?

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 Yeah, the Framingham study found that people over 50 who had at least 200 cholesterol or higher

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 had a much lower risk of Alzheimer's disease because it's brain protective as well as heart protective.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 There you go.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000
 Okay, we've actually got a couple of callers on the line, so let's take the next caller.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 Hi, caller, you're on the air?

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 Hello.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 Hi, and where are you calling from?

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 You're calling from Arcata, well, actually Trinidad.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 Okay, welcome to the show.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 Yeah, I am dealing with a tooth infection that I've had for a number of years now,

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 and I have been treating it with tea tree oil, and it seems to be helping some,

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 but still hanging in there.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 It seems like it's very hard to really get to because I guess it's anaerobic,

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 so it's really a challenge to treat.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 I'm wondering if Dr. Peat has any suggestions about how to go about it.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 What kind of infection is it?

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000
 A tooth infection.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 A tooth infection, yeah, and it's pretty nasty sometimes, some of the discharge I get from it.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 I know a dentist who cured chronic dental problems like periodontal disease

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 with simply giving his patients a laxative, and he would talk at dental conferences

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 and say he was a good surgeon, but he found there was no need at all to do periodontal surgery

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 if he gave the patients laxatives, but the idea didn't catch on among the dentists.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 Do you have any constipation that is long-standing at all?

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000
 Not really.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 No.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 As far as I know of, I'm pretty regular, although I would say that my digestion hasn't been tip-top.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:33.000
 I'm 57, so it's like, I don't know, it's gotten a little bit sluggish,

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 but it hasn't been anything I would call constipation.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 Sometimes just avoiding starchy, especially raw vegetables and raw, fibrous fruits.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 Apples are easier on the intestine if they're well-cooked,

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:59.000
 and vegetables ought to be cooked about 40 minutes to be protective to the intestine.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.000
 Wow. So avoid raw vegetables.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 Yeah, often if you keep the vegetables that you've been eating,

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 put them in a plastic bag where they don't get oxygen,

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 and keep them at 98 degrees for a few days,

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 and you'll basically see what happens to them because we don't have enzymes for breaking up the cellulose of vegetable material,

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:43.000
 and so the bacteria are favored by the warm, moist conditions, and the bacteria can thrive on raw vegetables.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 Wow. That's just so counter to what everybody else has said, so it's so interesting to me.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 Well, I know Dr. Peat's always advocating making sure that the transit time through the gut is as quick as possible,

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 so that prevents the, well, especially with the right kind of foods,

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000
 prevents the overgrowth of any bad bacteria because of an endotoxin point of view.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 It's the endotoxin that gets into the system that can cause inflammation and other disruptions,

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 and I know tooth infections are fairly, well, supposedly notoriously difficult to treat because they don't have a particularly good blood supply,

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 but I think the seat of most people's conditions when it only comes down to changing the diets in people

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 and then hearing back of the great amount of changes that are going on in their life,

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 that the gut is the most important aspect of humans is what you put into your gut and how well it moves through.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 It's probably the single most important factor in good health.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 Raw carrots are the exception among vegetables because being a root vegetable, they happen to be very germicidal.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 Bacteria won't touch them in transit time.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 So I should even avoid salads?

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 Yeah, green salads or other vegetables other than raw carrots.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 Okay. Wow.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 And do you know, Dr. Peate, anything about the light therapies that are out there these days?

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:26.000
 I've been treating it also with a friend of mine who does light therapy,

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 and she's got a little box that gives red rays off.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 I'm just curious if you know anything about light therapy.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 Yeah, sunlight is the best in general, and if you're going to be exposed to full sunlight very long,

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 then you have to worry about sunburn, so avoiding sunburn is the only caution.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:02.000
 Many hours a day of brilliant light, white light, incandescent light, or sunlight,

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 it has many effects balancing the hormones, increasing your defensive hormones such as progesterone and testosterone.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:25.000
 And just a year or so ago, an American researcher trained rats and found that just shining red light on their heads,

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
 because red light penetrates through the tissues,

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 he found that their learning was improved just by exposure to light.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.000
 Wow. So that could be helpful in the tooth infection.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000
 Yeah, it helps your whole system, lowers the stress,

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:53.000
 and probably lowers the tendency to absorb endotoxin for your intestine.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 Thank you very much, Dr. Peate, and thank you, Andrew.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 so can you believe it? We've only got about four and a half weeks, and then the daylight starts getting shorter,

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 and we start going back the other way. But anyway, we haven't quite got there yet.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:19.000
