00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Hello and welcome to Politics and Science. I'm your host, John Barkasin.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 Today we feature an archive of my interview of Dr. Raymond Peat, PhD, courted at WGDR circa 2001.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 In this show, he discusses the remarkable story of Dr. Stefan Durevic and his cancer treatment known as probiazine.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 He also covers the heroic but ultimately fruitless efforts by Dr. Andrew C. Ivey, who was at the time one of America's most prominent scientists.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Dr. Ivey attempted to give this promising treatment the clinical testing that its positive findings warranted.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 In case you're interested in the subject, the meticulously written book that tells the story in detail is by Herbert Smith Bailey and is called K-Probiazine, Key to Cancer.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 That's spelled out at the end of the show.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 In this show, Dr. Peat also discusses the suppressed work of an earlier brilliant cancer researcher called Dr. William F. Koch, MD and PhD, and his successful cancer treatments.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 If you're interested in Dr. Raymond Peat's work, many of his writings are available at his website, Raypeat.com.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 And now, once again, here's Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 A.C. Ivey, these people all overlap for various reasons, partly because several of the alternative health, especially alternative cancer treatment people,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 were working on essentially the same ideas and they were all attacked by the established forces that were working on different assumptions.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 What year was this?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Oh, Koch started his work, I think one of his publications was 1911, another 1914, and by the '20s he had a clinic going in Cleveland.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 He was a professor of medicine and chemistry and he was the first person to take seriously for biochemistry the work on free radicals of Moses Gomberg,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 who demonstrated that free radicals really exist.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 They aren't just a hypothesis that exists only on paper,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 but Moses Gomberg showed that highly colored chemicals appear when you can get free radicals who separate in solution.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 And the color is because the electron that is no longer paired is free enough that it absorbs light in the visible spectrum.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 And so that's one of the simple ways to test an unpaired electron, is that suddenly the solution goes dark.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 And even chemists didn't take Gomberg seriously.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 In Russia he was a major influence, but in the United States for probably 40 or 50 years free radical chemistry just couldn't take off.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 The industrial chemist, I think it was DuPont himself, maybe not, but anyway it was the head of one of the early plastic companies,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 told William Koch that he had better be quiet about the idea of applying free radical chemistry in medicine,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 because people didn't even understand it in organic chemistry.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 And they were going to say he was talking about fantasies if he talked about the free radical basis of biology.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 And it was around 1950s that the instrumentation became available to demonstrate that free radicals really did exist in living tissue.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 And what was the name of the scientist who ran for president in, I think, the Peace and Freedom Party in the 1970s?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Very commoner.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 He was one of the first people to demonstrate free radicals existing in living tissues.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 I didn't know that.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 When did the free radical theory start?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Well, about 1905, I think.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 1900 to 1905 was when Moses Gomberg was demonstrating them.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 But immediately Koch was putting it into theoretical thinking about what cells are doing.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 And he applied it to the concept of polymerization and blood clotting as his first thing.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 And he knew that in healing a wound or a cancer, blood clotting is one of the first things that happens.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 And the clotting abnormalities are characteristic of cancer.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 And it turned out that for places like DuPont, the polymerization was, in fact, a very important practical industrial principle using the free radical.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 But Koch anticipated even industrial thinking within just a few years of starting to work on it.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 He was applying it theoretically and practically to devise both explanations for disease and therapies.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 He seems like quite a brilliant man.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Yeah, so quick to apply knowledge that was very clear and definite.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Other people couldn't accept it because it just didn't seem to fit the low standard that was common in chemistry and all branches of science and biology at that time.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 The free radical, sorry I'm pretty ignorant here, but the free radical theory, that must have come out of the atomic theory of electrons.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Yeah, ordinary chemistry on paper, they would show an atom coming loose or an atom with other atoms attached to it coming loose from another group and taking one electron away.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Each atom had been contributing an electron to a pair that made a stable compound.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 On paper, they could take away a group with one electron and allow it to combine somewhere else.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 They just couldn't believe that that could really exist in a watery solution, for example.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 But how Moses Gomberg first did it was with, I think it was triphenyl ethane.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Anyway, it had three large carbon rings attached to one tiny little molecule in the center.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 The tendency of the benzene ring to repel because they were placed too close together and the whole group wasn't very soluble in water.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 The force of the water and the closeness of these large groups, if you diluted, if you kept adding water to a solution of this compound,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 as it got very highly dilute, the color would suddenly change from clear to a deep purple.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 As you got it diluted enough, the groups would be able to fall apart from each other and exist freely in solution.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Anyone that knew homeopathy, which a well-educated doctor did in 1900, knew that the principle of homeopathy was that some compounds become chemically more reactive when they're highly diluted.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 So it was natural for someone with a medical education to see the importance of this chemical principle.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 But not many people who had studied homeopathy as well as classical medicine also studied chemistry, which Koch did.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 The first time I heard about Koch was, I think, 1943 or '44.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 People were circulating little mimeographed newsletters about the scandal of how he was being persecuted by the FBI and so on.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 The history of his two trials, it's been written up. Koch himself told some of the stories.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 These stories have never been refuted. They're pretty well documented.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 He said that criminals who tried to kill him later were proven to be, at that time, agents of the FBI.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 The public didn't start hearing of mob FBI connections or CIA connections until the Church Committee in the '70s brought out the stuff.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 But it was something that had been going on for a long time.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Is that pre-Hoover?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Oh, no.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 That was Hoover.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 Hoover was there for about 50 years.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Yeah, he was quite a gangster.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 Why were they going after him at that point?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 Well, his clinic was so successful in Cleveland that it was bringing a lot of attention to him, even though he followed DuPont's advice.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Maybe it wasn't DuPont, but anyway, he followed this industrialist's advice and didn't explain the pre-radical basis.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 He was just having objective results that brought a lot of attention to his clinic.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 He had tried to publish all of the details in the period 1917 to 1921.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 He submitted papers all over the world, but the standard medical journals wouldn't accept pre-radical chemical explanations for any biological events.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 So the government then was claiming that he had a secret method, simply because he couldn't have journals to publish it.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 They called it a secret quack method.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 But years later, after I had studied books thoroughly, and I had also been studying Otto Warburg's work and Albert St. Georgi's work on cancer,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 I noticed dramatic parallels between the work St. Georgi was doing all the way through from the '30s when he got the Nobel Prize,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 all the way down to I think it was about 1973 or '74 when I wrote St. Georgi.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 I outlined over about two pages the amazing similarities between Koch's work that he had described in his book, done between 1910 and 1925 or so,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 and what St. Georgi started doing in about 1932 and continued to the 1970s.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 I outlined this amazing set of parallels and said, "Is this just coincidence, or were you influenced by W.F. Koch?"

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 Because in all of St. Georgi's work, I couldn't find a single reference to W.F. Koch.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 He answered that he had the highest respect for the work of W.F. Koch, which obviously meant that since he had never referred to it in print,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 that he knew what had happened to Koch and he didn't want it to happen to him.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 Maybe we could go back a little bit and talk about Koch's cancer therapy and how he was persecuted.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 Who was he threatening at the time?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 I think it was the FDA itself that accused him of violating the law by selling something that they said couldn't cure cancer.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 So they had it analyzed and couldn't detect anything in it, but the machinery...

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 They had his cure analyzed?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Yeah.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 They said it was distilled water, and he made some in court according to his procedure,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 and he took this highly colored material and diluted it and was so dilute that it looked like distilled water.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 He gave them the sample and had them analyze it, and they said it's distilled water.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 So the jury could see that their own eyes had seen stuff go into it, and the government was telling them it wasn't there.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 So twice he was acquitted, but he decided it was time to get out of the country with people trying to kill him

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 and keeping him constantly in court instead of doing science.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 So he spent the rest of his life after 1944 in Brazil.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Are there any remnants of his work still operating in Brazil?

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 Yeah.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 I guess about 15 years ago I talked to a very old man who had worked with him,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 and I don't think there's probably anyone still living who is directly connected with him.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 He died, I think, about 1968.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 And what was the distilled water solution?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 Was it homeopathy?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Well, these people that worked with him said that it was done by judgment.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 He used a red platinum electrode and passed alcohol vapors, not an electrode but a reactor.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 It was heated electrically to just the right color of red,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 and then he passed a stream of alcohol vapor over that,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 and at that temperature the alcohol polymerized into a water-soluble chain of molecules

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 which were unstable enough that they would release the individual,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 either carbon, oxygen, hydrogen group, or a small chain of those carbon-oxygen groups into solution.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 And that was the primary reagent.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 He also used benzoquinone at high dilution, but that was just an easy-to-make, lower-potency thing.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 The primary reagent was this thing which required the judgment of knowing just how red your platinum reactor had to be.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 And so people who had seen him do it could repeat it, and there were people in Brazil,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 might still be there, I suppose, their lab, have passed the technique along.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 I haven't heard from them for years.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 And how did this affect, how was it in the anti-cancer therapy?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 He, well, one of his early publications had to do with the muscle spasms

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 that typically follow removal of the thyroid gland,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 and the parathyroid tend to be removed along with the thyroid if the surgeon doesn't make a special effort,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 even though that was used as the explanation for why thyroid surgery causes these muscle spasms.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 Even the most careful surgeon who takes out the thyroid,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 even when he leaves the parathyroid, typical for the patient to suffer these spasms.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 And anyway, Koch experimented with the removal of just the parathyroid glands

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 and found that if you give any salt electrolyte, such as potassium, sodium, magnesium, or calcium,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 if you give it generously, you prevent the spasms.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 And he was arguing that the parathyroid gland was involved in detoxifying compounds that derive from ammonia,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 guanidine and methylguanidine, and that these chemicals are poisonous

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 and known to cause seizures and muscle spasms.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 And he could demonstrate that he was causing those to be passed off in the urine by increasing the salt intake.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 And that was published, I think, in 1917.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 But then A.J. Carlson, a very powerful professor at the University of Chicago,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 and his group decided that one hormone has only one action,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 and that they basically proclaimed that the parathyroid hormone has the action mobilizing calcium,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 and that in a calcium deficiency, you get the spasms.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 But there are just terrible problems with that, the whole setup,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 because their description of what's happening to calcium turned out to be without foundation.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 It was all a hypothetical theory that attempted to describe this hormone in terms of one singular action on calcium.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 And that one turns out not to be the way they thought it was,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 and still no one has reverted to consider Koch's explanation.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 But anyway, Koch explained the toxicity.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 These compounds, they're similar to what ammonia does,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 but the amino or ammonia group occurs in many chemicals that produce seizures and spasms and overstimulation.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 We now call it excitotoxicity.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 And ammonia and serotonin, just a tremendous range of amino compounds, have this action.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 And the carbonyl group that was the essence of Koch's treatment,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 whether the carbonyl was in his polymer that he made on his platinum reactor,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 or whether it was the carbonyl that was part of the benzoquinone molecule,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 it was this which Koch explained as drawing electrons to itself,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 away from the electron donors of the ammonia compound.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 And during this time, not only was free radical chemistry an underground current,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 the acid theory, Gilbert Lewis, this was happening at the same time.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Lewis was a professor and chemist.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 I think his theory came out in 1914,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 and it was a general theory of acidity and alkalinity in terms of electron withdrawal or donation.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 And it was exactly compatible with Koch oxidation reduction explanation of how his catalyst worked.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 But again, the Lewis theory, which was totally general as a description of acids and bases, couldn't take on.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 People brought out the Brunstad-Lowry theory of acids,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 which is what everyone now teaches that acid is a hydrogen ion donor.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 pH is a description of the concentration of hydrogen ions.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 And even though it's not a general theory, because there are acids which contain no protons,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 no hydrogen ions, this is the standard theory of acids and bases.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 So Lewis's theory of acidity, which was true and general,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 was displaced by basically erroneous theory,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 which is now everyone's chemical textbook description of what an acid is.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 They're still saying it today.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 Yeah. And just totally ignoring the implications of Gilbert Lewis's good theory,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 and especially the implications it has for biology and medicine and biochemistry.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 But St. Georgi was essentially looking for evidence of Koch's high-energy promoter of oxidation as an electron acceptor in physiology.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Koch had postulated that benzoquinone was useful because there was a quinone molecule in the cell that this was a close imitation of,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 and would therefore activate.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 And it wasn't until 1950 or so that it was discovered that there in fact is an essential oxidizing quinone in the cell, in the mitochondrion,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 and it's so ubiquitous that it's called ubiquinone.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 But at the time Koch was saying this, analytical chemistry wasn't refined to the point that it could go beyond theory,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 which had therapeutic results.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 And so they said it couldn't have therapeutic results because it isn't there.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 But St. Georgi appreciated the logic, and so he was working on the respiratory chemistry,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 and in the process accidentally discovered things like big parts of the Krebs cycle of the mitochondria

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 and ascorbic acid and so on.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 But this was really in the process of working on respiration itself.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Is this what he received the Nobel Prize for?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 Yeah, for his discoveries that led to the Krebs cycle and ascorbic acid and so on, respiration, muscle studies too.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 The muscle action was another one of Krebs things, you know,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 the methylguanidine causing muscle contraction by donating electrons to a system that should have the electrons withdrawn by the oxidative catalyst.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 And this became clearer and clearer in St. Georgi's work,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 why he was working both on muscle contraction and oxidative metabolism.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 At the time, it seemed like he was working on two separate lines.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 But it is the explanation of St. Georgi's whole career, basically, because he later became explicit in showing why the donation of electrons to muscles causes them to contract.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 And another theory besides the proton theory of acids, another theory that just becomes an obstacle to understanding is the membrane theory of cell function,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 which explains cell electricity in terms of ions and protons.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 And St. Georgi was working on the direct involvement of electrons and respiration as the primary thing that regulates those electrons.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 And in consciousness, for example, consciousness disappears instantly when oxygen is no longer available to accept electrons,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 before there's any detectable change in cellular energy level.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 And St. Georgi was focusing on these things that really work, really explain cell physiology,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 and basically ignoring the silliness about protons and cell membranes and so on.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 And one of St. Georgi's experiments involved adding electron donor chemicals and electron acceptor chemicals to a living muscle.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 And if the donor and acceptor were related to each other in terms of their oxidation potential, the muscle would contract in their presence.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 If these two molecule groups were not tuned to each other, the muscle wouldn't react.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 And this was about as close as you can imagine coming to verifying what Koch was saying about the electron acceptor and donor,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 that the donating an electron to a muscle system or any cellular system causes it to go into the active state,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 and the high-energy oxidant causes it to stabilize and go into a resting state.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 And for all of these people, Warburg, Koch, and St. Georgi, cancer and allergy and muscle spasms and seizures

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 were all examples of the activated state in which there are excess electrons.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 And oxidation was the basic answer to restoring the cell to a stable resting state.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 This puts the cancer problem in a different evolutionary light.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 These people were seeing cell division as the basic state of any cell,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 that at a point in evolution, oxidative respiration came in and made it possible for cells to stop dividing long enough to form part of a functioning multicellular organism.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 And so the reversion to cancer became simply interference with the ability to respire on the cellular level.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 So the problem with cancer and spasms and seizures is that your cells are just not getting the oxygen.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Or can't use it.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 Warburg's definition of cancer metabolically was that it's aerobic glycolysis.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Ordinarily, glycolysis is a process similar to fermentation in which sugar is used very wastefully,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 and it happens in the absence of oxygen because metabolism is very efficient.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 And glycolysis happens normally only when there's no oxygen because it's so inefficient.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 And when you block the oxygen apparatus or the supply, you get intense glycolysis.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 And so if it's the apparatus rather than the supply which is blocked, this is what happens in disease.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 And so this is aerobic glycolysis versus anaerobic.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 Anaerobic is the normal glycolysis.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 Aerobic glycolysis is evidence that the respiring organ isn't working right.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 And so all these people were on this different track of looking for the causes of disease and cancer.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 Why do you think they were so shunned by the powers that be, the medical people at the time?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Well, in the case of Koch, I think the way Koch tells the story is just that they couldn't understand.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 And he actually makes sort of almost a case for rational behavior on the part of the government and the medical association.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Just in terms of their being badly educated, badly motivated authoritarian people,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 they simply couldn't see and didn't want to learn what these people were saying.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 My professors all the way through college and graduate school treated Otto Warburg's work as a strange,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 faint idea of this very famous, powerful German, even though he got the Nobel Prizes

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 and is recognized as solving both ends of the essential oxidative cellular mechanism,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 applying that to cancer, which he did very early, was simply put down as character flaw in this otherwise great scientist.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 But it seems, I can see maybe they wouldn't understand and maybe they shunned him, shunned him,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 but to try to kill Dr. Koch, it actually shows that they were threatened by him.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 Yeah, I think the way to understand it really, even though Koch does tell the story in his book,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 I think the best way to get insight is to read Herbert Bailey's book about probiazone,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 because here they were contemporaries.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 Andrew Ivey was one of the biggest establishment doctors in the country,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 the founder of several medical associations and vice president and head of the medical school at the University of Illinois.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 He was chosen to help found the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 and ran it for a year during the Second World War.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 The board of the American Medical Association, which he had belonged to,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 chose him as America's representative to the Nuremberg trial to testify on universal medical ethics.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 He was simply one of the biggest of shots in American medicine.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 And when this Yugoslav doctor who had a cancer treatment, he thought, came to the United States,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 he quickly found out who the big shot was in medicine and took his idea to Andrew Ivey,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 who was an intelligent person and had been thinking along the lines that the cancer is the loss of some restraining process.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 He, I don't think, was quite up to the speed of Koch and St. Georgie,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 but he understood the thinking that was fairly common at that time,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 that there might just be a lack of restraint that allows cells to start dividing.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 And this line of thinking has been demonstrated over and over.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 For example, many people don't think about why our liver is as big as it is and no bigger

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 when it has such a capacity for producing new cells.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 If you cut off half an animal's liver, it will regrow the liver to the right size.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 And if you join two rats together in their circulation and remove the liver of one rat,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 the liver of the second rat grows to be twice its normal size so it can handle the circulation of both animals.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 And this is a well-documented theory that it was these chemicals of restraint were called "palones,"

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 P-A-L-O-N-E, meaning a restraining influence.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 And it can be demonstrated in the cornea and in the skin and any organ that is able to divide.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 If you take an extract of that and add it to the growing culture,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 cell division stops specific to each tissue so that the organism knows how much of a given tissue or organ it should have.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 And when that amount of calone is produced, cell division stops.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 So the absence of that has been considered an obvious influence in abnormal tumor production.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 And people were, at that time, many people were working on tissue extracts,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 trying to get that sort of stuff in a form that would be general enough to apply to a tumor of different tissues.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 And some people would extract tumors.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 One of the main lines of thinking was to extract it from urine or from the kidney or from the liver,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 something that had a general regulatory function.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 St. Georgie was extracting it from human urine, and he called it "retin" versus "promine,"

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 "promine" being the amino promoter of growth and "retin" being the restraining influence.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 And for example, Leonel Strong, who developed the mice colonies that are in common use,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 he developed strains that 100% of them will get breast cancer.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 And with using extracts of liver, Leonel Strong showed that he could not only cure the cancer of the individual,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 but even that individual's descendants for several generations would be free of cancer.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 So he was demonstrating hereditary imprinting as well as the cologne principle of tissue extract curing.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 He was getting the cologne straight from the liver?

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 Yeah, he had a time when he was using shark liver, but I talked to him,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 and he said that he thought that any kind of liver would have the active material.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 And I experimented with beef liver and so on.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 And you get a lot of the substances that are similar to what Coke was working with in the kind of extract that you do.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Anyway, Andrew Ivey knew about this other line of research,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 and so when the Yugoslav doctor said that he had vaccinated horses with an organism that causes tumors,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 actinomyces bovis, and produced a tumor and then extracted the blood of the horses,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 let the blood clot and then extracted it the way these other people were doing liver and blood and urine and so on.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 The technique I learned from Leonel Strong was to use absolute ethanol,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 grind up the liver into a fine powder in the absolute ethanol,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 and then evaporate the alcohol from the material you've extracted and then resuspend it in water.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 That was exactly the technique that Ivey learned from the Dureviks,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 and it was a standard technique for getting things that are slightly oil-soluble and slightly water-soluble.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 It forms a sort of emulsion when you take it up in the water.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 The Durevik got his attention because he knew that it was in principle biologically reasonable,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 and so he immediately was interested in testing it,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 and he took patients whose doctors said they had only about one or two month life expectancy

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 because they were so seriously sick with cancer.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 In these people who were on their last leg, he saw a dramatic result,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 and at that point he wasn't looking for a cure,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 and he was using very tiny doses like 10 micrograms per patient,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 but one injection would cause a very high proportion of the patients to have dramatic improvement.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 He reported this after just about two years of tests in which a lot of the patients did end up dying,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 and the responses to one or two injections were so amazing that Ivey said,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 "This stuff has to be studied in better ways as there have to be double-blind studies," and so on.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 This book by Herbert Bailey documents in just the most horrifying way

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 the ways in which the power structure started acting.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 One after the other, Andrew Ivey's physicians were taken away from him.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 He was fired from his vice presidency, and then his professorship,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 he was kicked out of even the scientific organizations that he had founded.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 One after the other, they would threaten him and say, "You'll be punished if you don't give it to us,"

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 and he would say, "No, it should be tested publicly," and he would lose another job,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 and he went from being at the very top of American medicine

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 to being basically a community college teacher for the rest of his life,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 and as late as 1964, he was interviewed and asked if he didn't regret having stuck by his insistence

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 that the stuff should be tested, and he said no, he still thought it should be tested.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 Good for him.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 Well, and that's just because he wanted to test it.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 He wasn't saying it was the cure-all or anything.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 No.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 Well, it makes you wonder what the motives are.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 Well, the book, a good place to start, even before reading the book,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 is to look at the congressional record from the 88th Congress

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 and the material that Illinois Senator Paul Douglas introduced into the congressional record,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 the sworn testimony and a very ordered presentation in a compact form

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 documenting the things that Bailey says in the book,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 and among those are naming people of two big drug companies

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 and the treasurer of the American Medical Association as offering him as much as $2.5 million,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 offering the Durex $2.5 million for the rights of the chemical,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 and they refused, and the offers are still existing documents of the offers,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 and basically a conspiracy, and he said it in print and over and over,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 like the senator in the congressional record said,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 "If this wasn't true, why aren't these chemical companies and the AMA officials

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 and the AMA itself and the journal of the AMA, why aren't they suing for slander?"

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 Because these are such horrible things that are said about them,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 that they engaged in a criminal conspiracy to control something they thought apparently

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 was of tremendous economic value,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 and one of the most convincing things is that they refused to comment

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 even on why they wouldn't sue for slander or libel.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 Are you familiar with Dr. Samuel Epstein?

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 Oh, yeah. He's one of the still-living good guys.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 Yeah, I got to see his website.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 He's very critical of the American Cancer Society

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 and basically feels they're doing nothing on the prevention front.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 He feels that many chemicals that are being released into the environment

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 by industry and pharmaceuticals are causing cancer, and that mammograms,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 he feels that mammograms actually are not only not useful,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 but they actually can spread cancer.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 Yeah, yeah. John Goffman, his whole book on the prevention of breast cancer

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 is posted on the Internet, and Goffman, G-O-F-F-M-A-N,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 he was one of the Atomic Energy Commission's defenders of radiation in the '50s.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 That was how I came across him.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 Linus Pauling was the only scientist saying that radiation is bad for you.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 Everyone else supported by the government, including John Goffman,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 who was medical officer for the Warrant Lab,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 he discovered an isotope and so on.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 He was a very top figure in medical physics, basically,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 in physics itself, and so he was put out as a defender of the safety of radiation.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 But in the '60s, he started thinking about what he was saying,

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 and he explains how his conversion happened.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 He simply started thinking about what words he was saying publicly

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 and realized that they were crazy.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 Yeah, the lupicity.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 He says that three-quarters of breast cancers are caused by radiation,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 primarily medical radiation.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 Right. I was reading something that you had sent me

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 that said that bone density scans are basically x-rays.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 Yeah.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 I had never known that, and I have friends who are going in for bone density scans.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 Yeah, the terrible thing is that they're going to recommend that you do it anyway

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 because your old and old people have thinning bones,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 so why do they bother finding out how thin your bones are?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 And especially when ultrasound technology exists that is more meaningful,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 it will actually tell you the strength of your bones, not just how dense they are.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 And in the Journal of the American Medical Association itself,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 someone published a little graph showing tremendous inaccuracy of the bone scan

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 because of differences in fat and water in the tissues,

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 and some people have a lot of fat in their bone marrow

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 and others have very little fat but a lot of fluid.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 And estrogen, for example, affects the distribution of fat and fluid in your body.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 And this technique, one of the reasons the bone scan is popular

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 is that estrogen seems to increase bone density,

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 where all through the early, oh, the '60s and '70s,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 all of the evidence showed when you grind up the bones,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 they're not made more dense by estrogen.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 Estrogen causes calcium retention but no increase of bone density,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 but the x-ray technique used now for scanning

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 sometimes does give an apparent increase in bone density,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 but this publication shows that the fat-water artifact,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 which can be influenced by estrogen, could explain any apparent benefit.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 And since the ultrasound measures the strength as well as the density,

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 there are many overwhelming arguments why no one should ever have a bone scan.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 And besides being harmless and meaningful and accurate,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 the ultrasound happens to stimulate bone growth,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 where x-rays accelerate bone loss.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 Every time you get a bone scan,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 your bones are going to go away a little faster just for the x-rays.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 So that applies to the x-rays in the teeth, too.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 Yeah, and the x-rays bounce off your teeth and jaw bones

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 accelerate the atrophy of your jaw bone,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 but the bouncing rays go into your brain,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 and they know that the dental x-rays cause thyroid cancer and eye cancer,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 cancer of the eyeball, and if they're bouncing to that extent,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 obviously they're going through the brain,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 and the brain is the most sensitive of all tissues to radiation.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 And so a great way to produce Alzheimer's disease

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 ought to be to have lots of dental x-rays.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 Oh, God. Wow.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 It gives me another reason to be not so happy about going to the dentist.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 Do you think they could use ultrasound on your teeth?

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 Yeah. There are instruments already existing that give very fine resolution.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 All you need is a transducer that you can put in your mouth,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 and someone has made those,

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 and you can produce very fine resolution pictures of any structure you want to.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 Wow. So all you dentists out there that are listening, take note.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 Maybe you should say where to get Herbert Bailey's book or what the name of it is.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 It's probably out of print, isn't it?

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 Oh, maybe one of them is in print, but you can find them somewhere.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 Old bookstores would be where I would look, or libraries.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 The pressure caused the first publisher to fold up within a year,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 and book reviews were canceled, and positive reviews were canceled

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 while negative, dishonest reviews were published.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 So it isn't a popular book to publish or republish,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 so it's probably going to be hard to find.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 I see. But the name of it was by Herbert Bailey, and the book was called "Krebizen"?

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 Yeah, one was K-Krebizen, "E to Cancer," something like that.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 The title is clear enough.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 So it's K-R-E-B-I-O-Z-E-N.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 I-O-Z-E-N. Okay.
