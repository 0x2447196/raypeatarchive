 Hello and welcome to Politics and Science.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.720
 I'm your host, John Barkasin.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.680
 Today we feature an archive of my interview with Dr. Raymond Peat, Ph.D., recorded at

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.200
 WGDR circa 2001.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.840
 In this show he discusses the remarkable story of Dr. Stefan Durevic and his cancer treatment

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.640
 known as probiazine.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.080
 He also covers the heroic but ultimately fruitless efforts by Dr. Andrew C. Ivey, who was at

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.200
 the time one of America's most prominent scientists.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.360
 Dr. Ivey attempted to give this promising treatment the clinical testing that its positive

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.320
 findings warranted.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.440
 In case you're interested in this subject, the meticulously written book that tells this

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:18.720
 story in detail is by Herbert Smith Bailey and is called K. Probiozine, Key to Cancer.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.760
 That's spelled out at the end of the show.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.080
 In this show, Dr. Peat also discusses the suppressed work of an earlier brilliant cancer

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:36.320
 researcher called Dr. William F. Koch, M.D. and Ph.D., in his successful cancer treatments.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.240
 If you're interested in Dr. Raymond Peat's work, many of his writings are available at

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.280
 his website, Raypeat.com.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.040
 And now, once again, here's Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:02:03.880
 A.C. Ivey, these people all overlap for various reasons, partly because several of the alternative

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.600
 health, especially alternative cancer treatment people were working on essentially the same

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:24.480
 ideas and they were all attacked by the established forces that were working on different assumptions.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.160
 What year was this?

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:36.880
 Oh, Koch started his work, I think one of his publications was 1911, another 1914, and

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.720
 by the 1920s he had a clinic going in Cleveland.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:52.800
 He was a professor of medicine and chemistry and he was the first person to take seriously

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:01.840
 for biochemistry the work on free radicals of Moses Gomberg, who demonstrated that free

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.720
 radicals really exist.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:13.080
 They aren't just a hypothesis that exists only on paper, but Moses Gomberg showed that

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:22.280
 highly colored chemicals appear when you can get free radicals to separate in solution

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:30.960
 and the color is because the electron that is no longer paired is free enough that it

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.640
 absorbs light in the visible spectrum.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.840
 And so that's one of the simple ways to test an unpaired electron is that suddenly the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.720
 solution goes dark.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:55.040
 And even chemists didn't take Gomberg seriously.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:09.480
 In Russia he was a major influence, but in the United States for probably 40 or 50 years

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.360
 free radical chemistry just couldn't take off.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:24.320
 The industrial chemist, I think it was DuPont himself, maybe not, but anyway it was the

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:36.640
 head of one of the early plastics companies, told William Koch that he had better be quiet

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.560
 about the idea of applying free radical chemistry in medicine because people didn't even understand

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.920
 it in organic, ordinary chemistry.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.520
 They were going to say he was talking about fantasies if he talked about the free radical

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.640
 basis of biology.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:14.280
 It was around the 1950s that the instrumentation became available to demonstrate that free

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.040
 radicals really did exist in living tissue.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:27.520
 What was the name of the scientist who ran for president in I think the Peace and Freedom

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.680
 Party in the 1970s?

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.480
 Henry Commoner.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:43.040
 He was one of the first people to demonstrate free radicals existing in living tissues.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.000
 When did the free radical theory start?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.880
 About 1905 I think.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:06:03.280
 1900 to 1905 was when Moses Gomberg was demonstrating them but immediately Koch was putting it into

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:10.320
 theoretical thinking about what cells are doing.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:18.080
 He applied it to the concept of polymerization and blood clotting as his first thing.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:26.840
 He knew that in healing a wound or a cancer, blood clotting is one of the first things

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.680
 that happens and the clotting abnormalities are characteristic of cancer.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:43.720
 It turned out that for places like DuPont, the polymerization was in fact a very important

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.680
 practical industrial principle using the free radical.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:58.120
 But Koch anticipated even industrial thinking within just a few years of starting to work

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.000
 on it.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.640
 He was applying it theoretically and practically to devise both explanations for disease and

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.640
 therapies.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.400
 He seems like quite a brilliant man.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:28.880
 Yeah, so quick to apply knowledge that was very clear and definite but other people couldn't

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:39.200
 accept it because it just didn't seem to fit the low standard that was common in chemistry

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.640
 and all branches of science and biology at that time.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:53.520
 The free radical theory must have come out of the atomic theory of electrons.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:04.400
 Yeah, ordinary chemistry on paper they would show an atom coming loose or an atom with

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:14.320
 other atoms attached to it coming loose from another group and taking one electron away

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:22.760
 from where each atom had been contributing an electron to a pair that made a stable compound.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:29.720
 On paper they could take away a group with one electron and allow it to combine somewhere

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:37.760
 else but they just couldn't believe that that could really exist in a watery solution for

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.760
 example.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:09:00.320
 But how Moses Gomberg first did it was with triphenyl ethane.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:18.120
 The triphenyl ethane was a compound of two carbon rings attached to one tiny little molecule

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.120
 in the center.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.320
 The tendency of the benzene ring to repel because they were placed too close together

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:30.720
 and the whole group wasn't very soluble in water.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:38.240
 The force of the water and the closeness of these large groups, if you diluted, if you

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:48.320
 kept adding water to a solution of this compound as it got very highly dilute the color would

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.800
 suddenly change from clear to a deep purple.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:01.520
 As you got it diluted enough the groups would be able to fall apart from each other and

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:07.320
 exist freely in solution.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:16.440
 Anyone that knew homeopathy which a well educated doctor did in 1900 knew that the principle

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:23.280
 of homeopathy was that some compounds become chemically more reactive when they are highly

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.280
 diluted.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:32.600
 So it was natural for someone with a medical education to see the importance of this chemical

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.600
 principle.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:44.160
 But not many people who had studied homeopathy as well as classical medicine also studied

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.520
 chemistry which Koch did.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:56.840
 The first time I heard about Koch was I think 1943 or 1944.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:04.520
 People were circulating little mimeographed newsletters about the scandal of how he was

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.080
 being persecuted by the FBI and so on.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:22.080
 The history of his two trials has been written up and Koch himself told some of the stories.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.960
 These stories have never been refuted.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.680
 They are pretty well documented.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:40.720
 He said that criminals who tried to kill him later were proven to be at that time agents

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.720
 of the FBI.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:54.240
 The public didn't start hearing of mob FBI connections or CIA connections until the church

00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:00.400
 committee in the 70s brought out the stuff but it was something that had been going on

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.400
 for a long time.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.400
 Is that pre-Hoover?

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.400
 Oh no.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.400
 That was Hoover.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.400
 Yeah, Hoover was there for about 50 years.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.400
 Yeah, he was quite a gangster.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.400
 So why were they going after him at that point?

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.400
 Well his clinic was so successful in the 70s that he was able to get a job at a hospital

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.400
 and he was able to get a job at a hospital and he was able to get a job at a hospital
