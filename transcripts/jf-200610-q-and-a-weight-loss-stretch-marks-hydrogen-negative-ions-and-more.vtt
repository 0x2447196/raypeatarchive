00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.180
 - Well, welcome to the Get Fit with Jodel podcast.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.580
 I'm Jodel and I have Dr. Ray Peat back with me again

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.920
 to answer your questions.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.520
 And boy, did we get a slew of questions this time, Dr. Peat.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.180
 I took a hiatus from podcasts for a while

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.140
 to do some reflection during all this public health issue.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.140
 And I think the questions piled up,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.520
 so I hope you are ready.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.040
 May I ask how you've been since it's been a little bit

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.240
 since we've talked, how have you been doing?

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.800
 - Very well, investigating as far as I can

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.740
 what's been going on.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:51.120
 My first reaction was that I couldn't see any pandemic.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.380
 And the last information I have,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.020
 even looking at the figures at the CDC,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.260
 even though they make this information

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.200
 something you have to add up for yourself,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.880
 but their figures are now supporting

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.880
 the very earliest estimates of the professors at Stanford

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 who are also saying nothing is happening.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.640
 The mortality from this virus is right in the range

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.640
 of a traditional flu influence of mortality

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.940
 about one fourth of a percent.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.840
 - Wow, I mean, I've heard you talk on other podcasts

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.120
 with similar statistics, and it's just like,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.400
 I see where the world is kind of in that fear monger state,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.440
 but it really begs a lot of questions

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.160
 about the severity of it.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.380
 We do have a question coming up later on

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.240
 from one of the listeners who was concerned

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.600
 about it, so I'm looking forward

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.000
 to getting to that with you.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.620
 I do have to tell you that you inspired me

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.920
 during this reflection time, I call it,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.820
 like I took some time off when we were all stuck at home

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.400
 to work on a hiking trail on our property behind our home.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.120
 So I was in the backyard chopping wood down

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.160
 and raking a trail, and I fell in love with it.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.480
 And I thought of you a lot, how you talked about

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.840
 cultivating things with your hands.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.440
 And I've always loved being outdoors,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.320
 but during this time of cultivating the land

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.580
 and creating something, I realized that I wanted

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.520
 less time on social media outlets and more time

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.600
 to give to my family and to creative processes,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.160
 so to speak, so I decided to completely shut down

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.760
 my Get Fit with Jodell Facebook.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.640
 I completely closed it down with over 4,000 followers,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.440
 because I realized, Dr. Peat, that you are still able,

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.920
 you yourself are still able to help a lot of people,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.440
 and you're not on social media, and you have a website,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.800
 you have the ability to podcast with different people,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.160
 you have your newsletter, that you reach out

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.480
 to a lot of hearts and minds, and you probably have no idea

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.140
 how many lives you have affected

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.200
 just by answering people's questions.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.760
 So in short, I'm commending you for that,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.560
 but also I'm inspired to do the same thing.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.980
 So I've resigned to be only, people will only find me

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.860
 on YouTube and not on Facebook, not on Instagram,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.680
 not anywhere else, so that I'm not constantly

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.360
 having to devote my time, my precious time

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.240
 to the social media pressures of life,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.240
 but rather to those who are truly seeking answers,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.300
 like our listeners.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.880
 So people that are coming to your podcast, Dr. Peat,

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.760
 I've found that these are the ones really asking questions

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.880
 and seeking answers to their health,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.120
 and I've found that social media is more geared

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.000
 for people to just numb out.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.340
 It's not a place where people are seeking help,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.080
 but rather they're just zoning out,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.000
 they're just ready to not think,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.760
 so let me just go through my feed.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.720
 But I feel like honing in on one outlet of podcasting

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.280
 with you and other like-minded folks

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.800
 instead of so many other outlets,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.600
 and really help our listeners and build the community too.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.420
 So long story short, here's my question to you, Dr. Peat.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.720
 You discuss how powerful that stress is a negative

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.480
 in our life, like it's so powerful

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.240
 this stress in our lives, and I feel like

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.820
 social media outlets are one of the biggest stressors

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.120
 that people aren't really aware of.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.780
 They're doing it every day, but I don't think

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.880
 they're aware of the pressures of social media.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.560
 So I wanted your thoughts on social media

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.720
 and its pressures of posting and getting likes

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.000
 and approvals from others, and being on devices,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.780
 which is a whole nother thing.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.720
 Do you think that this is one of the main concerns

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.200
 and causes of why people have a lot of health issues

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.880
 nowadays as opposed to 20, 30 years ago

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.000
 when we didn't have these social pressures

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.800
 of online presences?

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.800
 - I have never experienced Facebook or Twitter

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.880
 or any of those things myself, but I see people

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.880
 being deeply involved in their cell phone

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:11.760
 or their computers, and that's something that,

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.160
 oh, 50 years ago or more, there wasn't even that

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.280
 absorption in TV.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.280
 TV was just starting to be an obsessive part of the culture.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.380
 But my family didn't even have a TV

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.880
 until I was long out of college.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.280
 I think I had been out of college several years

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.320
 before we borrowed a TV to watch Kennedy's inauguration.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:57.360
 But even TV, I'm sure it's damaging kids

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:05.200
 to sit around inertly watching stories

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.600
 which are very cleverly designed propagandistically.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.240
 The Pentagon is now a part of the Hollywood industry.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:25.800
 They even invested in the latest technology development

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.880
 for Hollywood to create realistic images

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.440
 that can be mistaken for the real thing.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.960
 They can forge voices and personalities

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.960
 and the Pentagon can operate,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.200
 one person can operate many personalities on Facebook

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.680
 or the other social media, so people are interacting

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.400
 very often with computers that they think are human.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:10.320
 And it's not only stressful, but it's creating a dream world

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.200
 and the dream world people can be manipulated to do

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:23.880
 what the Pentagon or the CDC or the giant corporations

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.000
 want them to do.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.280
 Google, several years ago, sociologists demonstrated

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:38.480
 how by changing the definition of questions

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.120
 on a search engine, they could absolutely skew

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.260
 the way people voted in real elections.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:58.480
 And Google is obviously doing that.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.560
 They can control the elections.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.560
 And Congress worries about Russians or Trump

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.720
 or Ukrainians or whatever interfering with US elections,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:19.640
 but the very powerful demonstrated effect of Google

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:26.360
 on elections is ignored, apparently because Congress

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:32.340
 is bought off by the people who control the elections

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.560
 and are pleased with how they're turning out.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.880
 - There are so many rabbit holes.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.800
 I wanna go down with that, but I do remember,

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.680
 somebody recently told me that television

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.920
 actually stems from the kind of phrase, tell a vision.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.840
 So like you said, a dream world where they're kind of

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.840
 programming us to not think for ourselves,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.580
 but here, let me tell you a vision that you need to believe

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.480
 in and be a part of, yeah.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.880
 No, so yeah, so I can definitely see your point

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.640
 about how it is a stressor and even television,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.200
 not just social media, but just the idea of not being able

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.840
 to think for ourselves.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.040
 That's kind of something to be concerned about

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.640
 and how we might wanna dial back on our social media outlets

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.800
 and really focus on where is my time devoted to?

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.640
 How much time am I spending bettering myself

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.820
 versus lessening myself with the energy suck

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.780
 that is a lot of device time and social media time?

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.080
 Yeah, okay, well, I love that.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.560
 And before time gets away from us,

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.040
 I guess we should jump into everyone else's questions.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.580
 So I have a slew of questions.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.600
 If we don't get to all of you guys' questions today,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.520
 then I'll put them in the next one that we do.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.040
 But I wanted to give a big shout out to a guy named Matt.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.200
 He's a researcher at Harvard

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.960
 and he asked a question a while back, Dr. Peat,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.440
 and I never got to ask you this,

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.360
 but it's just an interesting question about adaptogen.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.800
 So Matt would like to know your thoughts on adaptogen herbs

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.280
 such as ashwagandha and rhodiola for helping with cortisol.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:14.320
 Oh, there are several levels that they work at.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:21.160
 Some of them are boosting the steroids.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:27.480
 Like ginseng has androgenic steroid materials in it

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.120
 that actually support, but our natural hormones

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:39.960
 like pregnenolone and DHEA are the body's adaptogens.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.680
 And so things that work with them

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.280
 are simply supporting our body's stabilizing effect.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.800
 There are two kinds of adaptation.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.800
 One, the emergency system that pours out cortisol

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:05.040
 and all of the stress-related steroids and other hormones.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:12.240
 These powerfully help you survive an immediate matter

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:18.000
 of minutes, seconds, and hours.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.240
 But then they become counterproductive

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.280
 and reduce your adaptability

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:31.240
 if they aren't backed up by increased energy production,

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.720
 which means anything that supports mitochondrial stability

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.720
 and health and good thyroid function

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.400
 and the ability to produce increased amounts

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.400
 of the stabilizing DHEA, pregnenolone and progesterone.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.240
 And the basic long range adaptogen

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:05.920
 is this stable energy production,

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.920
 keeping your mitochondria producing energy

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.440
 at a high rate and without producing toxic side effects.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:22.080
 An emergency activation with adrenaline

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.120
 tends to produce lots of free radical side effects,

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.200
 but the proper high energy production

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.560
 running on the basis of thyroid activity,

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.440
 you are actually wasting energy in the sense

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:47.720
 that you're producing a tremendous amount of heat,

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.960
 but that use of oxygen to produce energy

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.800
 is actually reducing the toxic side effects.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.600
 So becoming an inefficient machine

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.480
 that operates at a high temperature

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.400
 and seeming to waste energy,

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.400
 that's actually the proper route to long range adaptability.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 You assimilate and overcome by changing

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.920
 the nature of the threat and the stress,

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.120
 rather than being forced to change your body's structure

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.400
 or behavior by the cortisol acute stress route.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.120
 - Okay.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.720
 - And probably the single most important factor

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.480
 in staying on this route of long range

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:59.320
 protective adaptability is the production of carbon dioxide

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.680
 and the ability to suppress lactic acid formation.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:10.760
 That the acute stress, if you lack adaptability,

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.040
 pours out a lot of lactic acid

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.280
 with lots of bad consequences in the long run.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.120
 The ability to make carbon dioxide

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.320
 by running your mitochondria at high energy,

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:34.480
 why that is protected is that they are generating

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.800
 carbon dioxide which suppresses the free radicals

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.120
 and keeps lactic acid under control,

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.200
 keeps the whole system in an oxidizing state.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:53.000
 The reducing or pseudo hypoxic state

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.120
 is the destructive stress state

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.800
 that everything should be geared towards getting over.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.640
 - Okay, that's good.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.000
 I like your thought.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.120
 I've never thought of it in that terms of adaptogens.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.320
 I mean, I know we want long-term adaptability,

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.480
 but no, I never thought of it like that, so.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.440
 Michael asks, now this is an interesting question, Dr. Peat.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.580
 What are Dr. Peat's existential fears?

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:32.280
 - Currently, the insanity of the ruling class

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.560
 has been long range at things

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.600
 since I was three or four years old.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.600
 I started seeing sadism and cruelty in everyone in power,

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:53.040
 but the long range trend over all these years

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.040
 is that the ruling class is becoming more confident

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:04.560
 of its ability to go right to the final state.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:11.160
 This pandemic and the behavior of the CDC

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.520
 and all of its supporting agencies.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:21.760
 I think this is a threatening existence of life itself.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.720
 - Yeah, I would second those fears.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.580
 I'm with you.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:32.680
 Okay, M. Anderson asks, please ask Dr. Peat

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.320
 about caffeine and coffee addiction.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.480
 How can caffeine be good if it is habit-forming?

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.800
 Caffeine triggers cortisol release.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.320
 How can this be good?

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.560
 What about acrylamide in carcinogen?

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.400
 I'm sorry, what about acrylamide,

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.160
 the carcinogen chemical that's released

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.660
 when organic matter is half burned like roasted coffee beans?

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.600
 Many people get problems with insomnia.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.560
 Anxiety become edgy due to coffee.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.400
 Quitting coffee, old turkey.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.600
 I think she means cold turkey.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.040
 Gives me terrible withdrawal.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.080
 Why bother with coffee, Dr. Peat?

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:10.080
 - A part of that type of reaction is because

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:16.940
 the lack of a properly coffee-consuming technology

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:22.400
 like the Japanese have their tea ceremony.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:28.240
 We need a better coffee-consuming technique

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.480
 which involves good, thick cream

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:38.720
 because cream slows the absorption of the caffeine.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.840
 The people who have the terrible reactions

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.840
 are usually hypothyroid and have a blood sugar problem.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:55.240
 They take black coffee off and on an empty stomach

00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:00.320
 instead of eating and it drives their adrenaline

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:05.360
 and cortisol into a frenzy of tissue-damaging stress.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:14.240
 using coffee only with food,

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.220
 never on an empty stomach unless there's plenty

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.400
 of cream or milk with it.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.400
 Coffee con leche is a good method of taking it.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.920
 But heavy cream, if you like the flavor of rich coffee,

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:37.660
 cream improves the flavor while slowing the absorption.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:42.220
 And if you look at the effects of caffeine,

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:49.240
 for more than 50 years, studies in animals

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:54.380
 of all sorts have demonstrated that caffeine

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:59.380
 is so powerfully carcinogenic that it can be given

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.700
 with concentrated cigarette smoke,

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.520
 a very powerful carcinogen.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.760
 And just a little caffeine added prevents

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.760
 the carcinogenicity of topically applied cigarette smoke.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:20.200
 And that observation led people to test them

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.860
 against other carcinogens.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:28.860
 Even viral carcinogenesis is inhibited by caffeine,

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.180
 even radiation carcinogenesis,

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:38.180
 the most absolute form is suppressed by caffeine.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:45.040
 And so it would be good if we didn't burn the coffee,

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:52.000
 that technology comes from partly the fact that people

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.860
 like the taste of a smoky burn things.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.080
 And partly because it softens the bean

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.900
 and makes it easier to grind to get the caffeine out.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.260
 Like the technology of fermenting tea,

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:14.280
 making black tea releases lots more caffeine than green tea.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:26.000
 So black tea is really biologically much more effective as an anti-stress, anti-cancer agent. 

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.140
 So the present way of preparing coffee

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:40.000
 isn't the ideal, it's just part of the tradition

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.560
 and it turns out that the more coffee people drink,

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.520
 five cups and up, for example,

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.800
 are the healthiest in general,

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.800
 even a lower rate of Alzheimer's disease,

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:02.160
 of cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease even.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.720
 So empirically, even though coffee is full

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.600
 of all of that smoky junk,

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.240
 which would be best to eliminate

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.320
 the caffeine override so powerfully.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.600
 - I love that you said five cups or more

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.600
 'cause I'm sitting here going,

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.440
 "Okay, then I'm gonna live a nice long life."

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.160
 My grandma was a big coffee drinker and she lived to be 94.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.080
 So I believe that there's something

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.000
 to the health effects of it.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.920
 To unpack her question a little bit more,

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.240
 like what about the habit forming aspect?

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.760
 Maybe it is something that because it's so medicinal,

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.160
 it's okay to have a little habit forming with it.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:57.140
 - Yeah but part of that is really what you need.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:04.880
 Before I took any thyroid supplement for many years,

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:10.160
 I recognized my symptoms as being typical

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.960
 of people who were hypothyroid.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.800
 For example, being nearsighted

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.200
 and having migraine headaches

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.160
 are classical low thyroid signs.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:26.160
 But for various reasons,

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.000
 just didn't get around to trying a supplement.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.800
 And in that period, I would drink

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.760
 often 50 cups of coffee a day.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.760
 And I would stave off the stresses

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.360
 and the migraines and such.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:53.360
 But I was pouring a huge amount of coffee through my system

00:22:53.360 --> 00:23:00.160
 just to feel functional, keep my energy up

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:05.080
 so I could work efficiently.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.240
 First thing I thought of waking up in the morning

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.240
 was a cup of coffee.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.200
 And then I would just constantly

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.900
 have a cup of coffee in my hand all day.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:21.600
 Within a couple of days,

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.900
 after I began using a thyroid supplement,

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.780
 I woke up one morning and noticed something

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.520
 was very different and I wasn't craving coffee.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.400
 And I looked at my coffee drinking behavior

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.720
 and I was only drinking about five cups a day,

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.720
 four to five, and that happens spontaneously

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.520
 over a period of just a few days.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:55.520
 So it wasn't that I was addicted to 50 cups a day.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.680
 It was that my system recognized that

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.300
 as part of its homeostasis.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:07.460
 That could be called an addiction,

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:12.180
 but if it's repairing you and preventing disease

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.140
 and making you live longer,

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:19.580
 it's not proper to classify it with addictive things

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.620
 such as morphine.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:25.620
 Everything about morphine and the opiates,

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:31.540
 everything known about it is destructive,

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.760
 creates inflammation, promotes cancer growth,

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.360
 degenerative diseases and so on.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:45.360
 It's the basic archetype of a destructive drug

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:54.820
 and its addictiveness is just a part of that.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:05.160
 The reason people feel addicted to coffee and caffeine

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:10.220
 is mostly that it's filling in for something they need.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:15.820
 There is obviously no need for the opiates.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.620
 - I would agree with that because I feel like

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.460
 I'm the same way.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.940
 First thing in the morning I wake up,

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.180
 I think of coffee and I know--

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:29.180
 - The body takes all of those things into account.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:33.060
 Someone did an analysis of the English diet

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:38.580
 and even though nutritionists say that

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:43.380
 coffee and tea are nutrition free,

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:48.380
 this analysis showed that looking at the English diet

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:53.340
 as a whole, coffee and tea together

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:58.340
 provide 20% of several of the essential nutrients

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.420
 including some of the B vitamins.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.060
 - Yeah, okay, I love that.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.460
 There's another reason I need to keep drinking it.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:10.780
 Okay, well, okay, here's one question.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.640
 What's your favorite brand of coffee?

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.480
 What do you drink?

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.880
 What's your favorite go-to cup of coffee?

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:21.540
 - Oh, I don't know.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:26.300
 I usually like, but for taste,

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.940
 a fairly dark roast or French roast,

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:35.200
 but just because of the recognition

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.100
 that it's got a lot of smoke in it,

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:45.540
 I sometimes alternate by drinking a light roast.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:51.900
 If you can find a variety of coffee that's low in acid,

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:59.580
 then the light roasts are really very rich tasting.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.740
 - Okay, okay, Brandon asks,

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.140
 okay, he must be dealing with gut dysbiosis

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.660
 'cause he says, I have SIBO gut dysbiosis

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.460
 and the foods don't seem to be cutting it

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.260
 that are carrot salad, bamboo shoots, et cetera,

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.340
 which, and if they're not working,

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.340
 which antibiotics might Dr. Peat recommend?

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.940
 What doses, frequency, and where to locate them online,

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.940
 if possible, as well can one expect some symptoms

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.140
 with use of these, thanks as always, Brandon.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:39.660
 - I think the first things are to make sure

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:44.660
 that your whole digestive system is working optimally

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:53.220
 and your inflammatory reactions are minimal.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:58.300
 And that, two of the most important things

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.860
 are getting enough thyroid

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.300
 so that you have quick peristalsis,

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.080
 quick transit through the intestine.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.740
 That simply can keep the bacteria

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:15.980
 from having the time necessary to develop

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.140
 in the upper part of your intestine.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:24.140
 And intense digestive fluids are toxic to bacteria,

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.820
 helping to keep the intestine clean.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.600
 And quick digestion makes you absorb the food,

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.700
 basically tending to starve the bacteria

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.360
 by getting it all yourself.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:44.700
 And vitamin D and calcium,

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.120
 the ratio of calcium to phosphate,

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:53.060
 keep your immune system from being oversensitive.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:58.380
 And an inflamed reaction of the immune system

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:04.060
 creates an interactive, supportive environment

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:09.260
 for the bacteria, for example,

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:14.260
 pouring out inflammation, fluids,

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:19.380
 containing lactic acid will support bacteria

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:24.160
 that produce irritants that create more inflammation

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.580
 and more lactic acid.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:31.420
 So making sure your calcium, vitamin D and thyroid

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:36.020
 are optimized is the first thing.

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:42.140
 And then the two types of antibiotic

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:47.780
 which have many therapeutic effects

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:52.780
 besides killing germs are the tetracycline class

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:58.500
 and the erythromycin or azithromycin type.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:04.200
 You've probably heard azithromycin

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.700
 being recommended for treating the coronavirus.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:12.620
 That fits into the whole picture

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:17.620
 that the problem with the virus is the inflammation,

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:22.860
 not the presence of replicating viruses.

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:27.780
 But the inflammation predisposes you

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:31.180
 to support the viruses.

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:35.060
 It's the same with bacteria in intestine.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:40.060
 The erythromycin category and the tetracyclines

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:44.500
 lower the inflammation directly

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:49.500
 apart from killing the bacteria.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:54.580
 So they have several therapeutic functions

00:30:54.580 --> 00:31:01.860
 and the erythromycin category has the extra property

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:06.500
 of stimulating peristalsis.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.500
 So it's germicidal, anti-inflammatory

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:16.660
 and pro-propulsory propulsion activating effect.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:20.860
 - I'm so glad you answered that the way you did,

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.720
 like how you gave the recommendation

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.780
 for like what else could be going on

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.300
 before you just jump right into antibiotics.

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.220
 Like you said, what about your thyroid?

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.100
 Like have they addressed the fact

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.380
 that they could need more thyroid support?

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.940
 And I think that's so spot on

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.240
 because with gut issues you have to make sure

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.580
 that you're weeding out the bad stuff

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.400
 before you just bring in all the good stuff

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.120
 like carrot salad and bamboo shoots.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:44.980
 Those are great.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.740
 That's your seed, like weed, seed and feed.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.580
 You wanna bring those into like good plants

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.700
 that you're gonna plant in a garden

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.820
 but they also have to weed out all the weeds

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.740
 that could be potentially the cause

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.940
 for why the gut dyspiosis happened in the first place.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:03.940
 - Yeah, just intensifying the vitality of your organism

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:09.900
 that the bacteria can stay there and no one minds them.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:16.060
 So they might be there, you might be eating a lot of turds

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.780
 but that doesn't do any harm

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:22.780
 because the bacteria aren't being stimulated and fed

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:29.980
 by the metabolic defects of a sick organism.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:34.420
 - Yeah, and even the commensals, like the good bacteria,

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.540
 the nice little commensal communities can actually overgrow

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.580
 and become pathobions or pathogens.

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.860
 So it's like you really have to look at

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.020
 what is the major cause behind the dysbiosis

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.740
 and then address that before you just add

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.660
 all these other things in

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.080
 or before you just annihilate the whole gut

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.400
 with an antibiotic.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.080
 Okay, good.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.140
 All right, somebody with the title I Love Sugar says,

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.220
 "Please ask Dr. Peat what causes stretch marks?

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.220
 "Is it possible to reverse or improve them?"

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:09.220
 - One interesting experience that I saw with stretch marks

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:17.020
 was a young cousin of mine who was about probably six

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.880
 or seven months pregnant.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.740
 She had these, they looked like

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:28.900
 bodice broadness, old-fashioned suspenders

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.780
 and zigzags of purple and red,

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:37.300
 shiny, silvery, scar tissue-like material

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.180
 all across her abdomen.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.740
 She said they had just developed in a few days

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:47.500
 and I asked about her diet,

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.260
 which wasn't terribly bad, but not very good.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:55.420
 But I mentioned oysters and eggs

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:59.500
 as having all of the nutrients needed,

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.500
 especially copper and selenium, zinc and so on.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:12.020
 She came back just, I think it was two or three days later

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.540
 that said she had eaten a lot of oysters and eggs

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.340
 and she showed me her belly.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:21.980
 It was absolutely perfect, no stretch marks.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.500
 - Wow.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.680
 Well, oysters are high in zinc, right?

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.100
 And I've heard that zinc really can help those

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.140
 and that some of them with stretch marks

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.240
 may have a zinc deficiency as well?

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.860
 - Oh yeah, multiple deficiencies.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:41.800
 Copper is part of the elastin molecule,

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:46.800
 so it's a essential factor in keeping your tissue elastic.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.820
 It works in blood vessels too for protecting them.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:54.860
 - Okay, so along with your sugar, I love sugar,

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.300
 you wanna eat some oysters and some eggs too.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.820
 (laughing)

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.060
 Okay, Ebony Gordon says,

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.240
 can Dr. Peat give advice about treating resistance

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.500
 to thyroid hormone?

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:10.020
 Is it safe to take high dose of T3 for prolonged periods?

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:10.860
 Thanks.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:17.260
 - It depends exactly on your need.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:25.620
 For example, I've known people who have had

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:31.180
 terrible life-long hypothyroid symptoms,

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:38.260
 extreme unopposed estrogen affecting her lung function,

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:46.900
 poor oxygenation, very high cortisol,

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:55.380
 just extremely fat hips in size and so on.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:36:00.900
 And basically crippled by her hormone imbalances.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:07.380
 She felt a little better when she had

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:11.900
 what her doctor considered the maximum prescription

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.860
 of armored thyroid, five grains,

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:20.860
 which the natural thyroid consists of

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:26.220
 about 1/4 T3 and the rest T4

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:30.280
 when it's broken down by digestion.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:36.860
 But recognizing that she was recovered partly,

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.700
 but still crippled, she found another doctor

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.900
 to prescribe another five grains

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:48.820
 and where a normal person at four or five grains

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.980
 would be a total full replacement

00:36:53.980 --> 00:37:00.440
 that could make up for total removal of the thyroid gland.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:06.140
 That five grains had only a small effect,

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.120
 maybe a fourth of what was needed,

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:14.120
 indicating that only the T3 in the glandular thyroid

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.460
 was having a therapeutic effect.

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:21.160
 On the second five-grain dose that she added,

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:25.180
 she felt basically twice as good.

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:30.180
 She found a third doctor over a period of just a few months,

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:35.380
 so she was taking 15 grains of armored thyroid.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:40.380
 And if you look at the 1/4 T3 content,

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:45.980
 that added up to the equivalent

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:50.980
 of four grains or a total whole gland replacement

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:55.880
 in the form of only T3.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.500
 - Wow.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.560
 - She didn't have any hypothyroid symptoms,

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:05.260
 but on that dose, it was only a few weeks

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.100
 and she totally recovered her health

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:12.300
 and went down to 10 grains and then five grains.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:18.700
 Her body was simply unable to respond

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.540
 to anything but T3.

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:26.380
 But given that therapeutic dose,

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:31.140
 it was only a few weeks before she didn't need that much

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.060
 and could reduce the dose to a third.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:41.060
 And what happens is that in the absence of thyroid function,

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:48.580
 you shift over into all of these maladaptive things

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:53.620
 such as high cortisol and estrogen and serotonin

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.600
 and nitric oxide production,

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.740
 things that all interfere

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:02.920
 with your mitochondrial energy production.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.920
 So your body is blocked from responding to the T3.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:13.420
 So you can use pure T3 therapeutically

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:18.620
 but when you have used it to help to assimilate the nutrients,

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:24.860
 then having assimilated the nutrients,

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:29.860
 you are now able to convert T4 to T3 as needed.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:35.820
 And so you can get the full dose out of glandular thyroid

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:41.620
 or even a pure thyroxine compound.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.860
 What most doctors prescribe.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:50.860
 And in women, the natural predominance of estrogen

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:57.460
 compared to men in women is limiting their liver's ability

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:03.100
 to convert T4 to T3.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:08.100
 And so women almost always have a very limited

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:12.380
 inadequate reaction to T4.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:17.380
 And increasing the dose can interfere

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:22.500
 when it reaches a certain excess,

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:27.500
 it can begin to displace T3 and have a suppressive effect.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:32.340
 - Okay, and for clarification,

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.940
 can you tell everybody like,

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.580
 when you say a grain of thyroid,

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:38.220
 can you explain how many milligrams,

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.180
 like let's say they're on eye armor

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.660
 or whatever like you mentioned this lady was,

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.060
 how much would that be with one grain of,

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.780
 is that like 16 milligrams?

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:53.700
 - The traditional grain weight was a little over 60 milligrams

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:58.180
 and a five grain tablet,

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:04.820
 I think their definition was around 300 milligrams by weight,

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.540
 maybe a little over 300 milligrams.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.500
 - Wow, so she was taking like,

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.540
 oh my goodness, so many, like 15 grains you said,

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.860
 so that's like 900 milligrams of thyroid.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:23.820
 Wow, okay, so bottom line is,

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.860
 sometimes we don't know how much our body actually needs

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.900
 when it comes to thyroid supplementation,

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.060
 like you really have to kind of just keep bumping it up

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.940
 until you feel like you're seeing the results

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.200
 of an improved thyroid.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.260
 - Yeah, it's very important to go,

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.700
 not only by your symptoms,

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:46.140
 but by your waking temperature and pulse rate,

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:50.820
 and then the effect of food on your temperature and pulse rate

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:56.900
 and your stable daytime resting temperature and pulse rate.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:00.940
 - And so symptoms even like Raynod's,

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.660
 like if someone has Raynod's

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.340
 and they're taking thyroid supplement,

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.540
 but that's still a symptom that's there,

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:10.660
 that's an indication that they're not getting enough, correct?

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:16.900
 - Yeah, the temperature of a person's

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:21.060
 tip of nose, hands and feet,

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.400
 especially the fingers and toes,

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:29.340
 that those can be shut down

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:34.020
 in order to keep your core temperature up to the function,

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.220
 your brain and lungs and heart

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:41.220
 have to keep their energy going to maintain the organism,

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:45.840
 but under stress, you can cut off the circulation

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.740
 to the extremities, including your tip of your nose.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.380
 So checking the temperature of those,

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:57.140
 for example, putting your fingers in your armpit,

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.900
 if they feel unnaturally cold,

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.560
 that's a sign of low thyroid.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.820
 - Okay, very good.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:10.820
 Lynn Marie asks, I just purchased all of Dr. Peat's books

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.220
 and some of his newsletters and I'm learning so much,

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:14.060
 so that's good.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:15.980
 What are Dr. Peat's thoughts on using

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:19.580
 a quality negative ion generator while sleeping?

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.920
 I've read so many positive things about them.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:28.180
 - For many years, I've kept one operating by my bed.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:35.140
 If I could get more of them at a good price,

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.400
 I would probably have more of them running,

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:43.660
 but if you, for example, if the weather is bad,

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:51.700
 you can often notice the effect

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:57.480
 that a series of studies in Poland very well,

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:03.900
 good experiments, measurements showed that the action

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:09.860
 on the lung is to provide the active electrons

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:22.940
 reducing electrically the enzymes, mono-amino oxidase,

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:32.020
 supporting that enzyme's function in the lung,

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:37.020
 which is mainly to destroy circulating serotonin

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:44.180
 and serotonin in proportion of your general stress,

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:50.320
 but especially of intestinal inflammation.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:55.380
 The intestine pours out a huge amount of serotonin

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:59.380
 into the bloodstream and the lungs are the main site

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:04.380
 of destroying that serotonin and these studies in Poland

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:11.380
 showed clearly that negative ions in the atmosphere

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:16.760
 accelerate the detoxing of serotonin.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:21.140
 - Wow, okay, so I guess I need to look into these

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.420
 'cause I've always heard about them,

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:25.260
 but I've never got one, but you make a powerful statement.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.680
 Is there a particular brand that you like?

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.680
 - Yeah, the person who was making the one I got,

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:40.680
 which is very good, decided it wasn't profitable enough

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:47.160
 and he showed a lot of them and said that the work

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:52.160
 was too much for the income, so I don't,

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:56.680
 it's a matter of first looking at to make sure

00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:00.880
 they don't put out a measurable amount of ozone.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:05.880
 That's toxic to the lungs, but you should be able

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:11.960
 to feel a cold wind effect when you hold upon your hand

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:16.960
 in front of them because there's a stream

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:21.280
 of negatively ionized air being driven away

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.960
 from the electrode that you can feel as an actual streaming.

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.560
 - All right, well, that's good to know

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.520
 and I'm sure Lynn appreciates that, too,

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.880
 'cause she was thinking about it.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:36.160
 So, got a question from Turkish Postman.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.520
 How to improve hearing, Dr. Peat,

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.200
 how do we improve our hearing?

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:48.120
 - Classically, thyroid is the most important thing.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:55.360
 Reduces stress and maintains circulation and so on.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:01.080
 But something I noticed when I was on the way to Mexico,

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:10.840
 I had a big clock on the wall and I noticed

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:15.840
 on route to Mexico I, at a certain distance across the room,

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:23.880
 couldn't hear the clock ticking and after just a few weeks

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:28.720
 in Mexico, coming back to the same room,

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:35.760
 that same clock was loud and clear at the same distance

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:41.920
 and the same with eyesight after spending several weeks

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:48.280
 at 6600 feet, altitude or higher, myopia increased

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:57.520
 by close to two diopters correction.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:03.880
 I went from 11 and 12 down to nine and 10 diopter correction

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:13.600
 after just a season at high altitude.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:18.600
 But for the hearing, clearing up took just probably

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.960
 three weeks or so.

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.920
 - Oh, that is so cool because I actually,

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:30.000
 since improving my thyroid and eating less pufa

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.760
 and stuff like that after years of researching this stuff

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:38.480
 is like, my diopter went from negative 6.75

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.680
 and I'm down to negative five, so it's slowly improving.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.040
 So, it's cool to hear you say that

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.400
 because I don't think people realize

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.760
 that you can actually reverse vision problems.

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:53.440
 - Yeah, I've seen that happen in girls at puberty

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:56.960
 or mid-teen years.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.040
 It's very common for a girl to experience

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:05.040
 sudden onset of myopia and if they get their thyroid

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:14.240
 corrected around the same time, they no longer have myopia.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:19.680
 So, it's prolonged hypothyroidism

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:23.440
 that causes progressive myopia.

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:28.440
 And the connection between high altitude and thyroid

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:34.240
 is that thyroid is what lets your mitochondria

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:39.320
 produce carbon dioxide and keep the inflammatory lactate

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:44.560
 suppressed at high altitude.

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:49.560
 The simple physics of the Bohr-Haldane effect

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:57.240
 on hemoglobin, the reduced air pressure

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:03.480
 causes your hemoglobin to retain a higher level

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:08.040
 of carbon dioxide and so it's creating

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.320
 the same condition in your body

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.840
 that optimal thyroid function does.

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.520
 - Okay, that's awesome.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.640
 I love to hear that.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.520
 Next question, we're rolling through these.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.560
 Okay, Tina asks, what does Dr. Peat think

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.120
 about molecular hydrogen?

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:27.560
 I've seen a lot in the online stores

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.280
 with molecular hydrogen tablets

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.240
 and how they improve hydration.

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.440
 What are your thoughts?

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.800
 - My interpretation of it goes back to around

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:50.280
 50 years ago when I was reading in biochemistry

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:55.320
 trying to understand how electrons

00:50:55.320 --> 00:51:00.320
 and the reduction oxidation process works.

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:09.240
 A very well-known biochemist that did experiments

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:15.720
 in which he starved cells gave them

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:19.600
 no external source of energy

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:24.600
 but they were still oxidizing something

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:29.960
 and it was the dehydrogenase enzymes

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:36.480
 which were delivering energy to hydrogen

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:42.320
 to oxygen even though there was neither fat nor glucose

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:48.360
 provided as a substrate for these enzymes

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:52.360
 and so he called it nothing dehydrogenase

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:58.800
 and his nothing includes the gaseous form of hydrogen,

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:06.400
 because that isn't considered biochemical substrate normally

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:13.160
 but his enzymes can actually use gaseous hydrogen

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:19.880
 as a substrate and these can not only provide

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:26.720
 biological energy but they can have the same effect

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:31.560
 on suppressing pre-radical activity

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:36.560
 that running your mitochondria under an ordinary glucose

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:40.960
 and thyroid system would produce.

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.920
 - So maybe like these molecular hydrogen tablets

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:46.080
 in the water or the generators that are making

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.280
 molecular hydrogen might not be a bad idea?

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:54.600
 - Yeah, or just sniffing gas out of a little tank

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:55.440
 of hydrogen.

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.800
 - Okay, cool.

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:02.160
 All right, this is a little bit loaded question.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.480
 This is the one I was talking about with the COVID-19.

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:09.560
 So please ask Dr. Peat what the specific dietary factors are

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:13.640
 that have made Americans so vulnerable to coronavirus

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.880
 and also what foods should we be eating

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.440
 to make us resistant to it.

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:22.320
 He specifically says what else can I eat to protect it

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:27.080
 once it comes around again this winter or if it comes around?

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.280
 It's interesting to note though that it's like

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:32.880
 how can they say that it's gonna come back around?

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.040
 You know, like how do they know that?

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.280
 And it just makes you wonder like you said

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:38.960
 the powers that be like how do they know

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.480
 it's gonna come back around?

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:47.320
 - There are some interesting videos

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:51.000
 that give some of the background

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.320
 that had never been publicly widely discussed

00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:00.040
 showing that in previous years

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:04.560
 that they called it the flu season.

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:09.560
 But influenza was never the exclusive infection thing.

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:17.960
 A large block of the so-called influenza,

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:22.520
 no pathogen could be identified at all.

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:26.840
 Sometimes it was a bacteria responsible

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:32.560
 but I think it was 14% of all of the

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.000
 in which they looked for the pathogen,

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.000
 14%, seven to 14% were typical in previous years

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.360
 coronavirus infections.

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:50.360
 And three of those were the serious type

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:57.480
 that happened to overlap with laboratory-designed

00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:02.200
 intensified versions of the coronavirus.

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:07.200
 But everyone, the coronavirus previously

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:10.800
 had been known as a cold virus.

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.720
 Several viruses were called the common cold.

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:26.760
 Several studies in just the last couple of years have,

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:30.360
 for example, the Pentagon did a study

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:35.360
 to evaluate how effective the influenza vaccine

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:39.760
 was at preventing influenza.

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:45.720
 And they found, or at least did their best

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:51.440
 to interpret an effectiveness for the flu vaccine

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:57.800
 and concluded that it was probably 45% effective

00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:04.120
 at preventing influenza infections in the following season.

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:09.200
 But during that season, the people,

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:14.200
 different studies found twice as many infections

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:21.320
 by other agents up to six times as many infections

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:26.400
 by something other than influenza.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:31.400
 So while it was shifting almost half away from influenza,

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:39.080
 it was doubling or tripling or quadrupling

00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:44.080
 the number of lung diseases caused by other agents,

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.560
 including the coronavirus.

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:52.560
 And so if you look at the campaign,

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:57.000
 very heavy indoctrination, pushing the vaccine

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 on old people in both the United States and Italy

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:08.040
 last year before the onset of the coronavirus,

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:12.680
 of the 2019, 2020 flu season,

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:19.760
 they were basically reducing the likelihood

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:25.120
 of a flu infection, but greatly increasing,

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.400
 according to these studies,

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:31.120
 the likelihood of catching some other lung disease.

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:38.400
 So the first thing is not to worry so much

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.840
 about food or supplements or whatever,

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:46.840
 but to think about what's going on with the actual publicity

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:53.360
 about protecting against lung disease,

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:58.360
 the influenza vaccine, especially in old people,

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:02.840
 powerfully increases the risk of lung diseases.

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.080
 There are eight or 10 studies showing that.

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:10.720
 - Yeah, and it's never a bad thing to promote immunity,

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.320
 like build your immune system

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.560
 to fight all kinds of things we come into contact with,

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:19.000
 but I agree with what you're saying.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:19.840
 Go ahead.

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:25.960
 - Yeah, the antibody system is not our immune system.

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:31.800
 It's something that has been fixated on

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:36.800
 for more than 100 years driven by the pharmaceutical industry

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:42.040
 who wants to equate natural immunity,

00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:44.400
 if they can interpret natural immunity

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:47.160
 as the presence of antibodies.

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:51.220
 They want to equate it with their magic bullet drugs.

00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:56.880
 It all derives from Paul Ehrlich's doctrine,

00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:01.880
 but he shared the Nobel Prize with an embryologist

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:09.320
 who was interested in the whole body's participation

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:17.960
 in immunity, and that's the innate immune system

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:22.560
 that has been really suppressed and ignored

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:28.760
 over these 110 years, and it's our general health,

00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:36.120
 especially at vitamin D and thyroid,

00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:39.440
 the things that let us maintain the balance

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:43.000
 between carbon dioxide and lactic acid

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000
 that activates in the proper way this innate immune system.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.760
 - Absolutely, drop the mic on that one

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:54.520
 because it's like, improve your thyroid

00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:56.640
 and everything else kind of falls into place,

00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.640
 and then also get out in the sunshine

00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.640
 because sunshine, if we're talking coronavirus,

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:05.180
 is actually killed, it kills coronavirus

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.160
 in like a minute and a half

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.240
 according to some studies I read, so.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:14.520
 - The action of vitamin D and calcium,

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:19.520
 it's increasingly recognized as absolutely vital,

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.800
 especially for viral immunity, but for immunity in general,

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:28.800
 and what it's doing is not killing viruses,

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:33.880
 it's activating our anti-inflammatory processes,

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:41.840
 so it's working with aspirin, stopping inflammation,

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:47.080
 and it's the people who have a predisposing

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:52.720
 inflammatory condition who even catch the virus

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.800
 or develop any symptoms from it.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:00.600
 Something between 50 and 80% of the population

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:04.960
 can have the virus with absolutely no harm done.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:10.960
 It's someone with a preexisting inflammatory problem

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:15.760
 often from low thyroid, low vitamin D,

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.760
 low vitamin A, some malnutrition

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.760
 who have the inflammation that promotes

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:30.320
 the growth of the virus, so focusing on killing the virus

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:34.520
 is a completely unbiological idea.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:37.460
 - Okay, very good.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:40.240
 Ann says, can the doctor speak about the best way

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.760
 to lose 20 pounds, especially on my hips and thighs?

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.440
 I recently went to the doctor and was told

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.280
 I needed to lose 20 pounds,

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.000
 and specifically I carry it in my lower body,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.320
 what can I do for this?

01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:02.240
 - The woman I told you had such a resistance

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.560
 to thyroid hormone.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.720
 That was her physique.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.760
 You can see her ribs and her arms

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.960
 were about like a five-year-old child,

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.960
 but her hips were so wide that she actually had trouble

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.120
 going through a standard doorway.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:29.560
 So you have to look at your whole physiology,

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:34.160
 not just go by a doctor's TSH measurement,

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.760
 but you have to look at your vitamin D,

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:42.760
 make sure your parathyroid hormone is at the low end

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.360
 of the normal range.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:49.360
 When your thyroid and vitamin D are being interfered with

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:56.320
 or are simply deficient, your parathyroid hormone rises,

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:02.080
 just eating too much phosphate, meat and beans,

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:08.640
 for example, are characteristic excess phosphate sources.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:14.440
 Too much phosphate will drive up your parathyroid hormone

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:18.640
 the same way vitamin D deficiency

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:21.320
 or calcium deficiency will drive it up,

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:26.320
 and parathyroid hormone poisons your mitochondrial

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:32.160
 energy-producing system, so you can't lose weight

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
 if your parathyroid hormone is in the above average range.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.400
 And if you normalize that, you don't have to worry

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.320
 about losing weight because ordinary activity

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.440
 and diet will get rid of it.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.400
 - Okay, good.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.960
 All right, do you have time for one more question?

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.520
 - Sure. - Okay.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.640
 I do have a few more that we didn't get to,

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.520
 but I wanna give us one more little question here.

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:06.280
 I asked Dr. Peat, if one does not have access to thyroid,

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.400
 can other measures suffice?

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.440
 So I guess he's saying if he doesn't have access

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:14.120
 to thyroid supplements, how do I work around that?

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.200
 And secondly, I don't have a gallbladder,

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.100
 how can I improve my digestion?

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:25.280
 - Well, lots of things will fill in, like I mentioned,

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:30.280
 I was using coffee to make up for low thyroid function,

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:36.160
 but vitamin D and calcium are powerful activators

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.440
 of the energy system because they keep

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.360
 your parathyroid hormone down.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:48.160
 Having all of your minerals, both minerals and trace minerals

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:55.000
 are very important to keep your mitochondria

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.080
 operating properly.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.880
 - Okay, good.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.760
 That was easy enough.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.940
 What about the gallbladder?

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:10.040
 - You don't wanna eat a lot of fat at any time,

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:15.040
 but just the small amount that helps you absorb

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:19.080
 your vitamin D and vitamin A, for example,

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:24.080
 really just takes a minimal amount mixed in with your food.

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:29.760
 And it's a very fatty meal that will trigger the need

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:34.540
 for a gallbladder function.

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:39.540
 So a fairly low-fat diet and moderate-sized meals,

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:45.240
 people don't really suffer from lacking the gallbladder.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.760
 - Okay, and do you know anything?

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.600
 Like I've heard that coconut oil isn't in need of bile

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.720
 when you take in coconut oil, it really doesn't need bile

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.880
 to break it down, so that could be a fat

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.840
 that they could take in.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.200
 Is that the case?

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:04.040
 - It's still not good to trigger the reflexes

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:08.440
 when you don't have the gallbladder.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:13.440
 I think it could cause some kind of disturbance.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.800
 I think it's better to keep that low too.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.120
 - That makes sense.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:22.440
 Okay, Dr. Peat, well, that's the time we have for today

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.240
 for questions, so we'll jump into the few that we missed

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.840
 on the next call, so I really appreciate it.

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.640
 It's always so interesting talking to you

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.800
 because you get me thinking on so many levels.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:36.800
 So I'm gonna go check out some negative ion generators.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:39.080
 I think I even saw one while I was talking to you

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.960
 called the molecule that looked interesting

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.040
 and it said it had no ozone.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:48.040
 So maybe these folks that he answered your questions,

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.240
 maybe you can send him a little donation

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.900
 and that way he can get himself another ion generator.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:57.440
 'Cause yeah, I like to have one too,

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.800
 but I'm gonna have to save up for it.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.840
 They're kind of pricey, so.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:04.840
 - I paid $30 or something like that.

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:08.080
 I think you can still find them for $35, $40.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.600
 - Okay, all right, cool.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.800
 Well, I'll definitely look into that.

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:11.920
 Thank you so much, Dr. Peat.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.300
 This has been fun and we'll do it again soon.

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.320
 - Okay, thank you.

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.640
 - Okay.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.220
 (upbeat music)

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:22.800
 (upbeat music)

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.380
 (upbeat music)

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:27.960
 (upbeat music)

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:37.960
