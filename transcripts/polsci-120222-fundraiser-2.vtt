WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 is in these papers by Kunliff and Atzinger.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Okay, great.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 That's great stuff.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 And if I could have one follow-up, I'd love to hear Ray.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.080
 I'm always very interested to hear him talk about the dead universe theory and biological

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.520
 fields, so I'll hang up.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.960
 If there's anything you'd like to go into on that, I would be very interested to hear

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.960
 it.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.960
 Thank you, Ray, and thank you, John.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960
 All right.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.960
 Thanks a lot, Justin.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.000
 The which universe theory was it?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.240
 Justin, are you gone?

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.960
 I think he said bio-universe, but I'm not sure.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.680
 Are you having trouble hearing, Ray, on your end?

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.680
 No.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.960
 No, I just didn't get what kind of universe he said.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.280
 Maybe, yeah, I don't want to speculate.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.960
 Could it have been dead universe?

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.840
 Oh, possibly.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:05.320
 I can, for example, if you want to look at another controversial video on the internet,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:17.600
 Wallace or Wal Thornhill has some things on the electrical cosmos.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.840
 I think his website is thunderbolt.com, if I remember.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.840
 Okay.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 That sounds interesting.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.840
 We have another caller.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.840
 Are you there, caller?

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.840
 Oh, no, this is Justin again.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.840
 I was just going to clarify.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:40.200
 I was just talking about the notion that the universe was dead and inert, and most of biology

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.440
 was just kind of of that nature.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.280
 Do you understand what I'm saying, Ray?

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.040
 I certainly didn't get the word.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.400
 There was a bubble, right?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.080
 Yeah, he was saying that he was wondering that most of biology looks at the universe

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.000
 as being dead and inert and not a living system.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.160
 Okay, yeah.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:15.180
 The field idea in biology, embryology as the model developing according to its interactions

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.280
 with the environment, that idea continued.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:31.960
 Some of the people who were developing experiments on trying to understand the rules by which

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:39.200
 an organism takes form, some of these people were vitalists who believed there was something

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:49.760
 extra besides the matter, but at least they were interested in the actual events as the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.040
 organism took form.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:04.020
 They were knocked out of biology by the gene people who I would say are on the side of

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.440
 an inert cosmos.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:16.040
 They want to explain things in terms of essentially immaterial information, and they're the ones

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:26.200
 who talk about the vitalists wanting to introduce a vital principle as being somehow against

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.840
 the materialism of science.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:40.000
 But the genetics people really want to depreciate the material world in favor of an information

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.360
 world, and the idea of the central dogma was that the information that we have in our genes

00:03:49.360 --> 00:04:02.440
 is immortal and can't be added to, and it can only be written out into mortal, temporary,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.640
 imperfect organisms, but it's the timeless stuff.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:16.400
 So really, the calling people like Dreesch a vitalist and saying that they weren't really

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:24.800
 biologists, it's kind of self-referential because the genetics people have thrown out

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.160
 most of the interesting stuff in biology until the last ten years or so.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.280
 When they're starting to get back to the field theory again.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.280
 Yeah.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.800
 Did you get that, Justin?

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800
 Yes, I did.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.800
 Thank you.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.800
 Okay.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.480
 And I'll hang up so someone else can get in touch.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.480
 Okay.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.480
 Thanks a lot for calling.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.480
 All right.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480
 All right.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.120
 And the number again is 802-526-2326.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.440
 And I do have some questions here.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.800
 Let me get to them before we get busy.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:10.900
 There's one from Brittany asking, let's see, "If you are trying to self-treat for hypothyroid

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:17.720
 based upon blood tests and symptoms, how much T4 would be considered too much to take?

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:25.320
 And is T4 even necessary at all?"

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:36.960
 The problem with the commercialization of synthetic T4 that started in the late 40s

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:47.680
 is that they tested it on male medical students who are about 25 years old and selected for

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.760
 good health.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.400
 And they found that it worked in them just like the real thyroid substance that had been

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.200
 in use for about 40, 50 years at that time.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.440
 And the trouble is that it then became commercialized.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:16.320
 And women have at least five times the incidence of thyroid problems because of the antagonism

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.800
 between estrogen and thyroid.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:29.960
 And the thyroid sluggishness that's so common in women shows up as a slow metabolism of

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.240
 the liver.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.920
 Usually a woman premenstrually will get drunk on a fraction of the alcohol that it takes

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:46.360
 to make a man drunk because the liver is slowed down by the antagonism between estrogen and

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.000
 thyroid and oxidative metabolism.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:00.480
 And it happens that thyroxine has to be activated in the liver by taking off one of the iodines

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:07.040
 in the right position to make it the active hormone called T3.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:16.080
 And so if women are having already low blood sugar symptoms or high estrogen symptoms,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:27.240
 things that are the result of hypothyroidism, then T4 can very often not help or even make

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.000
 the problem worse.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Some experimenters took, they were trying to argue that thyroid does something other

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.120
 than rev up the oxidative metabolism.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:49.000
 So they took slices of muscle and kidney and liver and brain and heart and added thyroxine

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:59.680
 T4 to these cultured slices and saw that the liver had a tremendous burst of oxidative

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:09.000
 activity but the kidneys didn't do much and the muscles didn't do anything and added to

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.280
 the brain, it actually suppressed oxidative metabolism in the brain.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:24.080
 And so they said, you see oxidation isn't what thyroid really does, it just happens

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.840
 that the liver responds that way.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:34.560
 But they were looking at the pre-hormone, the liver has to turn it into the active hormone

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.880
 before it can work in the muscles, kidneys, heart and brain.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:50.120
 And what it turns out that the brain concentrates, the blood can have 40 times as much T4 as

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:58.240
 the liver, if your liver is a little sluggish and your brain will still concentrate the

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.040
 T3 to the point that it has a one to one ratio.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:11.640
 And so if you put the brain slice in the dish where it can't get a new supply of T3 constantly,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:18.720
 the added T4 can't do anything except displace some of the active hormone that the brain

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.120
 had been concentrating at the one to one ratio.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:30.520
 So adding T4 to the brain in the culture dish, it caused suppression of metabolic activity

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:40.540
 and in people, you very often see it causing neurological symptoms, strange electrical

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:51.160
 sensations or ringing ears or worse memory, various things that are really signs of worse

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.380
 thyroid function.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:59.280
 So it sounds like T4 probably is not, you shouldn't be taking very much of it if any

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.600
 at all, especially if you're a woman.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.640
 It's very good if you don't need it very much.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:16.120
 So a lot of people take a mixture of T4 and T3 supposedly close to the physiological dose

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.000
 of a one to five, I think it is.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.840
 Well the gland, if you take a human gland or a cow gland, it's close to a four to one

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.840
 ratio.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.840
 Okay.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.760
 And is that a good mixture to take if you're supplementing your thyroid with it?

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:40.360
 Yeah, even a five to one mixture is okay.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:48.600
 The people who were insisting on still using the armor with its four to one ratio in the

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:58.280
 1960s, as the pharmaceutical companies developed tests for diagnosing thyroid, they started

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:07.760
 noticing that the people who were taking thyroxine had maybe a 40 to one ratio of T4 to T3 in

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.920
 the blood, but the people who were taking armor had maybe a 10 to one or a five to one

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.440
 ratio.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:23.000
 And so they defined the people who were taking T4 as the normal and the ones who were taking

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.160
 armor as having too much T3.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:34.080
 But most doctors at that time weren't aware at all that T3 was the thyroid hormone.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.560
 Oh, I see.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.920
 So they jumped to conclusions and were still stuck with some of those conclusions.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:51.680
 Yeah, one of the ideas that spread quickly in the late 1940s when the first blood tests

00:11:51.680 --> 00:12:00.640
 for thyroid came on the market around the same time as Synthroid, the T4 product, it

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:10.160
 was the protein bound iodine test and where people like Broderbarnes had seen close to

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:17.520
 half of the population benefiting from some thyroid, which used to be part of the meat

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:24.560
 supply until the agriculture department said the meat companies could no longer sell it.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:33.320
 But in Broderbarnes' time, he saw that somewhere between 20 and 45 percent of the people benefited

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.080
 from taking some thyroid.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:46.640
 But these new blood tests in the late 40s found that 95 percent of the people had a

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:55.200
 fairly high level of iodine bound protein in the blood and that created the only 5 percent

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.920
 need a thyroid supplement idea.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:05.760
 But then by the 1960s, new tests came about and they realized that the protein bound iodine

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:11.520
 test had almost nothing to do with thyroid function, really nothing to do with thyroid

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.000
 function.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:24.560
 So the standard that still persists widely, that only 5 percent of the population is potentially

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:32.360
 a candidate for supplement, the basis for establishing that had nothing to do with the

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.360
 thyroid function.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:39.960
 Yeah, and I'm beginning to see that that's a common problem in science is that basically

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:45.680
 conclusions get set in stone and then they never get revisited again.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.960
 Yeah.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:53.240
 Lillia asks, there was a follow up question to that last one, let me just get that before

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.640
 I move on because I'll lose it.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:01.200
 Hang on a second, let me find that.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:10.800
 This is also, hang on, just a minute, here it is.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.040
 Yes, it was an undigested food question.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:20.280
 If you tend to constantly have excessive air, chest pressure, or feeling the need to burp,

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:25.640
 is that a sign of low stomach acid with undigested food causing problems or too much stomach

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:30.480
 acid and what would you do about it?

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.440
 If you have any idea.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:38.480
 I basically know that a lot of different things can cause that.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.640
 Some people can actually have reverse peristalsis.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:50.400
 When you analyze burps, most of the time it's air that you've swallowed coming back, just

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.600
 plain perfect air.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:15:03.320
 But sometimes you find other gases such as methane coming out in burps.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:13.560
 And Walder Albrecht, one of the interesting things he demonstrated was that it's pretty

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:23.280
 common for people to experience very, very intense reverse peristalsis.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:30.200
 He put some lycopodium powder in his medical students' rectums when they went home for

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.200
 the evening.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:39.640
 I'm beginning to get the idea that I wonder who wanted to be in his medical class.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:46.560
 He had them fill out a questionnaire saying whether they typically experienced morning

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:54.360
 breath and then when they came in in the morning after getting the lycopodium powder, he took

00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:02.160
 a swab in their mouth and found lycopodium powder in the mouths of the ones who typically

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
 had bad breath in the morning.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.760
 Wow.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.760
 That's a little grim.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:16.280
 I hope they didn't have girlfriends or boyfriends.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:22.080
 But do you think most of the time the burping is just from swallowing air most likely?

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.880
 Yeah, in the daytime.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:30.200
 Most of the reverse peristalsis happens in the night.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:39.080
 If you're low thyroid, your autonomic nervous system tends to rev up compensating for the

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:50.560
 low oxidative metabolism, it pushes it harder to increase your adrenaline in particular.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.360
 Some of the other things, histamine and serotonin go up too.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:06.640
 But the adrenaline tends to stop the forward propulsion of the peristalsis and then random

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:14.120
 signals, irritation from something in your intestine can probably send waves going both

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:24.160
 directions and that probably is more common when your digestive system is slightly paralyzed

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.560
 by very high adrenaline level.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.560
 Yeah.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.800
 All right.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.120
 Sheila asks, "What are your thoughts on multiple sclerosis?

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:41.200
 What causes it and how do you think it should best be treated?"

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:49.880
 In the 70s, I saw a series of five people over a period of just maybe, I don't know,

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.160
 a year or two I think.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:18:02.440
 And as they told me their symptoms, I said, "That sounds like classical hypothyroidism."

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:13.080
 And a couple of these people went to their old-fashioned doctors with a list of what

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:19.440
 they had just told me that their symptoms were and said, "Here are my symptoms.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.440
 What do I have?"

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:26.480
 And the doctor said, "Hypothyroidism," and gave them thyroid.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:35.720
 And that series of five people in a row, every one of them discovered they didn't have multiple

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:41.200
 sclerosis but rather just needed a thyroid supplement.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.360
 The same person asks, and this is definitely related, "Why do I feel bad after I accidentally

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.800
 took too much desiccated thyroid?"

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:55.240
 She increased it a little too fast over the course of a couple of weeks and she actually

00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:00.200
 managed to get some raw thyroid from a butcher, which is interesting because that's something

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.680
 I've been trying to do for a while unsuccessfully.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.360
 And she would like to know, "How long does it usually take for the thyroid to get back

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.960
 to normal when you stop eating it?

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.920
 And is there anything to do about it getting to feel better quicker?"

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:22.920
 Oh, well, people probably worry too much about it.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:31.520
 The T4 has a half-life of two weeks and T3 in different people can have a half-life as

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.720
 short as one day.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:44.440
 And so if you were getting a sudden overdose and your pulse went up maybe 150 beats per

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:57.000
 minute at rest, in 48 hours probably you would have lost at least half of your T3, which

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:05.920
 is the active stuff, and your liver would then be putting out just sort of a disposal

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.040
 amount converting the T4 to T3.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:18.920
 So usually if you took so much that you had a very fast 150-beat heart rate, in two days

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:25.920
 you would probably be down to a fairly safe, comfortable 120 beats per minute.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.920
 I see.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.520
 And if you wanted to intervene and make that even a quicker transition?

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:41.200
 Yeah, I've seen some people who just suddenly spontaneously became hyperthyroid or who had

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.240
 overdosed juicing cabbage raw.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:54.000
 It just takes a glass or two of that to very powerfully suppress your thyroid functions.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.040
 It worked at several levels, but usually a glass or two a day for a couple of days and

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.520
 the person is back down to normal.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.520
 And once you suppress...

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.160
 Oh, go ahead.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.000
 Well, liver is another suppressive food.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.920
 If you eat too big meals of liver, you can see a big decrease in thyroid function.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.480
 And how long does that suppression last from liver or cabbage?

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:26.920
 If you eat something and say you're not hyperthyroid, you're just normal, whatever that is, and

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.200
 you eat some liver, how long does it take for your thyroid to bounce back?

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.760
 Is that also just a matter of a couple of days?

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.760
 Yeah.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:43.080
 And the fear of suppressing your thyroid gland itself by taking too much thyroid, that has

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:49.360
 been tested by using isotopes that they could tell where the thyroid was coming from.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:55.360
 So they would dose them until they could tell there was no thyroid being produced by their

00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:01.840
 own gland, and then they stopped dosing them to see if there was any concern about prolonged

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.280
 suppression.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.920
 And everyone's gland came right back in a couple of days.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.680
 Well, that's encouraging.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:17.040
 So you can supplement your thyroid without fear of permanently taking it out of the system,

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.600
 which I think is what a lot of people are told if they talk to their doctor about it.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.640
 Yeah.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:33.000
 And the people, farmers who had their own animals, often they would eat the thyroid

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.760
 gland in the chicken neck, for example.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:44.240
 And one guy I knew said that on Friday, they always had fried chicken in the field for

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:50.880
 lunch and he said that Friday afternoons, he was always too hot to work, but he would

00:22:50.880 --> 00:23:00.360
 eat five necks and get probably 20 grains of thyroid or something.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:09.200
 A very suppressive dose and he would be very hot, but by the next day, it would have passed.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.800
 That'll get you moving.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.960
 There's another thyroid question here from Wade.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:21.640
 I would like to ask Ray's thoughts on reverse T3, if it is really necessary to use T3 treatment

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:27.760
 only to clear out the accumulated reverse T3 or if a combination thyroid product and

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.520
 proper nutrition will resolve the issue?

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:39.280
 Yeah, I think it's mostly caused by high cortisol and stress hormones.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:50.360
 So, just eating a good supportive diet, plenty of fruit or even juice and milk will help

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.680
 keep the stress down.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:24:02.240
 I think it works just as effectively as taking just small amounts of T3.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.560
 And what causes reverse T3?

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:08.000
 It's basically where your whole thyroid system shuts down.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.560
 Is that right?

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.560
 Yeah.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:20.440
 If your body thinks that you're having an overexposure to thyroid, it gets rid of the

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:27.800
 excess by turning thyroxine into an inactive kind of T3.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.080
 It takes off the wrong iodine.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:41.720
 And so, if you're fasting, for example, part of the thyroid is being excreted the way estrogen

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.180
 or toxins are being excreted all the time.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:55.320
 But part of it is being inactivated in a way that has an antithyroid effect.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:02.000
 That interferes with the active T3, so it's an extra fast way to turn off your thyroid

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:10.160
 function, not just getting rid of the active stuff but making a neutralizing, blocking

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.120
 form of the thyroid.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:22.080
 And I missed part of the question of the person who was concerned about MS and that had to

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:30.440
 do with a drug to decrease the number of MS symptoms.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:38.120
 I think it's called, I just can't find the word here, naloxone or do you know what?

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.400
 Yeah, naloxone or naltrexone.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.560
 Yeah, there you go.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.840
 Thank you.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:56.520
 When you're under stress, you produce the endorphins and the endorphins, they compensate

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:09.080
 for injury or stress and they should go away but prolonged stress can leave you sort of

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:15.600
 inhibited in various ways with the wrong pattern of endorphins.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:26.240
 And if a person has been exposed to prolonged stress, sometimes you can break out of that

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:34.160
 pattern and recover functions with an anti-morphine treatment.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:46.280
 These naloxone and naltrexone are the injected and oral forms of an anti-opiate that simply

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:56.080
 keeps the morphine or the endorphin from having its effect and sometimes that can restore

00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:01.200
 functions that have been suppressed.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:08.480
 And it sounds like you've opined that you don't like opiates, you think they're actually

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:14.320
 bad for you in the long run and so that sounds like it's not a bad thing to be taking?

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:23.160
 Yeah, I think it usually has its effect in just a few days though.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:29.640
 And I think if it hasn't really made a big difference in just a few days, then it's probably

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.800
 some other problem.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:41.320
 I see, so if you wanted to keep the inflammation low, could you just use some other anti-inflammatory?

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:51.160
 Oh yeah, all kinds of stabilizing anti-inflammatory things.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:59.480
 Thyroid and progesterone and the short chain fatty acids and sugars are all things that

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:04.640
 help restore injured demyelinated nerves.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:18.920
 Well let me ask before I go on to my own questions and the phone number again is 802-526-2326.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:24.880
 If anybody wants to call and you can Skype me at John Barkhausen, all one word.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:33.240
 Lillia asks, do you Ray have any thoughts on the efficacy of prolo therapy in which

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:39.400
 a solution containing sugar in the form of dextrose is injected into tendons or ligaments

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:45.120
 to strengthen weakened connective tissue, tissue that was weakened as a result of injury?

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.120
 Have you ever heard of that?

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:57.680
 Oh yeah, my father had it done, I think they used vegetable oil in the 1950s, a combination

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:09.680
 of novocaine and vegetable oil I think was the popular thing then and it causes an inflammatory

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:19.880
 reaction and toughening up of the ligaments and it can cure some back problems without

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:26.960
 anything very invasive, just a shot into the ligament.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:34.080
 And so it's proven to work but I think there are better things.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:45.480
 It's usually a low DHEA production from low thyroid, high estrogen and stress hormones

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:56.800
 that cause the ligaments and tendons to get weak and correcting the thyroid function and

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:05.960
 maybe taking a DHEA or pregnenolone supplement would be the natural way to strengthen the

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:10.640
 ligaments and tendons and it helps the bones at the same time.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:18.600
 Okay, I guess the person who did this did find relief from it and she'd been suffering

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:29.000
 for 35 years so it sounds like there's a couple ways to fix that problem.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.480
 And I was going to ask you, I know people wonder when they hear you talk, by the way

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:44.360
 we are talking to Dr. Raymond Peet who's a PhD in biology with a specialization in physiology

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:52.160
 from Eugene, Oregon and he also has vast knowledge of science history and we have about half

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:58.920
 an hour to go here at WMRW LP Warren and we are having a fundraiser by the way, I keep

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:05.000
 forgetting to mention it but if you'd like to contribute to alternative radio, radio

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:12.320
 that doesn't have commercial conscriptions, feel free to do that at any time at WMRW.org.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.640
 You can click the pig to make a PayPal or credit card donation and we're trying to

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:25.000
 raise our $10,800 annual operating budget which is not much money to run a radio station

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.720
 so and that's because nobody here is paid a salary.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.880
 Thanks for putting up with that Ray.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:44.200
 Let's see, I wanted to ask you, a lot of times it sounds like all of our problems boil down

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:51.320
 to having a slow metabolism or basically the engine that drives us and gives us all of

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.800
 our energy is not running well and I've heard the complaint about your writings before that

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:04.960
 all he ever thinks is wrong with us is our thyroid and somehow that's a put down.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.440
 How do you respond to that?

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:22.520
 Well it doesn't apply just to people, it applies to all complex organisms practically.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:30.320
 The difference between us and a fungus is that we've had a lot of thyroid and oxidative

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:36.440
 metabolism that the fungus has benefited from.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:45.760
 All of our functions are characterized by high energy oxidative metabolism, the brain

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:57.420
 more than any other part and as you look at the animal kingdom, the outstanding thing

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:06.360
 is that their oxidative metabolism increases as they go up the so-called evolutionary scale

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:18.200
 and it's that oxygen is driving our existence and our existence is culminating in a bigger

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:24.560
 more expensive brain that other animals couldn't afford because their thyroid function wasn't

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.640
 adequate.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:42.120
 It's really the essential thing given oxygen and sugar and a few other materials.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:52.120
 Thyroid is the catalyst for making things run right.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.520
 And people complain and I don't think it's actually true but when they say that all you

00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:02.640
 talk about is the thyroid, they make it sound like you're not interested in any of the other

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:09.580
 systems of the body but the thyroid does seem like the master system in terms of energy

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.840
 production for everything.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:23.040
 Yeah, and if your thyroid for example is working efficiently then your pituitary doesn't have

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:32.760
 much to do and you aren't likely to get a pituitary tumor, your adrenals don't have

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:43.520
 much to do, your ovaries don't get overstimulated, the other glands have an easy job when your

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.160
 thyroid is working right.

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:52.760
 If your thyroid gets interfered with then you've got to rev up your adrenals and then

00:34:52.760 --> 00:35:00.080
 your pituitary becomes a commander in chief and tells everyone what to do.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.800
 With the stress hormones.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:10.440
 Yeah, and then you're at risk of getting tumors of the ovaries or testicles or adrenal

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:17.880
 glands or thyroid glands because your pituitary is working them too hard.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.720
 That's a good way to look at it.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:29.720
 I also wanted to, in lieu of anybody else calling in, I have some questions about common

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.720
 problems.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:36.880
 A lot of people have arthritis and we've discussed that a little bit today, but in

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:43.200
 our shows about progesterone you were talking about several instances where progesterone

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.000
 was very helpful to women with arthritis, but what about men?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.280
 Is it the right substance to use for men in arthritis?

00:35:53.280 --> 00:36:04.640
 Yeah, one of the first people I gave it to was a friend over 40 years ago I think, who

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:13.520
 every afternoon his knee swelled up, obviously rheumatoid arthritis, it looked like a football.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:20.960
 I just got some standard injectable progesterone from the drug store and he put the whole vial

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.960
 on, rubbed it from his side down to his calf.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:35.600
 Two or three hours later he was walking and showed me his knee was no longer swollen.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:43.440
 Just about three or four years ago he was still walking without a limp, hadn't noticed

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.320
 arthritis in all that time.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:52.480
 So for people developing arthritis in their hands now, is that also a thyroid problem

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:57.280
 do you think or is it just some inflammation that could be taken care of with aspirin or

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.280
 progesterone?

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:08.040
 Yeah, when your thyroid is down you compensate with all kinds of other stress hormones.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:20.200
 Your autonomic system goes up, but so does your adrenal, cortical and aldosterone hormones.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:28.120
 Estrogen increases, even melatonin gets involved.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:34.080
 Everything runs to compensate when the thyroid is low.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:43.560
 And some of these compensatory things don't quite compensate fully and then they get involved

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.640
 in creating the inflammation.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:57.600
 And that's where the DHEA and progesterone either taken orally or can be applied topically.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:10.400
 Those are the things that are deficient that as a consequence the other more delicate and

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:17.840
 dangerous hormones such as estrogen and cortisol, those increase because you're low in progesterone,

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.360
 DHEA and pregnenolone.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:28.080
 And so supplementing any of those three or all three of them will usually alleviate or

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.520
 cure arthritis.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:39.000
 I've known people with dogs or horses, they thought that the horse was so old that it

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.720
 would never work again.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:52.360
 Just giving it progesterone, they made the horse healthy and happy for several more years.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:58.840
 And people with dogs that couldn't, basically couldn't walk around, couldn't get up on the

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:07.880
 furniture, they gave them pregnenolone or progesterone and they were their normal tests

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.880
 themselves.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.560
 That's great.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.560
 We have a caller.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.560
 You're on the air caller.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.320
 Hi, thanks for taking my call.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:24.680
 Ray, in your essay on autonomic systems there's a little passage about 20th century writing

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:34.480
 and painting and you talk about those things being considered expressive rather than communicative.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.480
 I was wondering if you could give some examples of 20th century writers or painters who you

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:48.200
 think are communicative and not insane and someone maybe who is falling in late steps.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.600
 I missed several parts of those sentences.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.080
 John, could you repeat them?

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.640
 I'm not sure if I got them all either.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.560
 Could you try again caller and I'll turn the volume up so maybe Ray will get it.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.880
 Okay, I'm sorry.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:05.880
 It might be my cell phone's fault.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:15.080
 I was just wondering if there are any 20th century writers or painters who you consider

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.160
 not insane, who you consider communicative rather than expressive.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:24.520
 Maybe somebody who is following in Blake's footsteps.

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.960
 Somebody who is following in Blake's footsteps.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:39.080
 I think Siqueiros was one of my heroes, David Alparo Siqueiros.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:45.760
 How do you spell that?

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.760
 S-I-Q-U-E-I-R-O-S.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:54.760
 Okay, thanks.

00:40:54.760 --> 00:41:01.520
 And why did you originally say that Ray, that the 20th century artists are considered to

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:06.640
 be out of their minds?

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:16.680
 They were driven out of their minds partly by the CIA's project called the Congress for

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:31.200
 Cultural Freedom, which worked with Nelson Rockefeller to glorify some of the, what Siqueiros

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.920
 called them the ghost artists.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:44.800
 They were creating a culture of anti-culture and the CIA knew exactly what they were doing

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:56.360
 and presumably Nelson Rockefeller did too when he and his two or three other philanthropists

00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:03.960
 concentrated on these people because of their anti-social consciousness.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:12.280
 And they ridiculed the idea that art should have a social consciousness and the CIA pumped

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:26.400
 Marshall plant money into creating this alternative culture of abstract expressionism and such.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:34.440
 Sounds like we need to start a new show called Politics and Art.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.920
 Corrupting influence of money everywhere.

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.280
 Do you have another comment, caller?

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.720
 No, thank you.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.720
 I'll get off now.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:50.640
 Okay, thanks for calling.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.760
 I'm not sure.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:58.600
 I think it was just because Siqueiros was working around the New York crowd that he

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.080
 saw what was happening.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:09.520
 It was years later before the actual facts became public.

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:20.720
 I think it was 1968 when this CIA financing of culture was revealed, but Siqueiros had

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.200
 been there seeing it going on.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:35.120
 So he was the first person I heard of writing about the government's official ghost culture.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.000
 And what do you think the government's motive was for doing that, Ray?

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.200
 Was it just to divorce people from the world?

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:52.680
 Well, to improve the power of the Rockefeller class by keeping anyone who said art should

00:43:52.680 --> 00:44:07.800
 be socially conscious, show them to be some kind of degenerate or subversive.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.120
 We just got another email question in.

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:21.240
 It's to ask you what causes moles on the skin?

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:34.560
 I'm not sure what you would say causes them, but in myself and in several friends, I found

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.880
 that they were very hormonally related.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:49.320
 In about 1980, one summer, I had been watching a mole grow on my belly, and it was obviously

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:54.040
 to me becoming a dangerous melanoma.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.080
 It had grown from a little brown spot.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:02.120
 Can you just keep it down while Ray answers this question?

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:10.520
 Turn off your mic for a second.

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:16.880
 It was becoming an obvious melanoma to me, and a couple of doctors who happened to be

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:23.000
 visiting that summer saw it and told me that they thought it was a melanoma.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.920
 But around that time, I was experimenting with different steroids, and I just happened

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:37.560
 to be tasting some DHEA around that time.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:46.920
 Without thinking of any connection, one night I noticed a shiny red dome on my belly where

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:55.000
 the mole had been, and over the next three or four days, the mole disappeared.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:02.040
 Thinking about it, I realized that I had been sampling the DHEA around that time.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:07.560
 The next time I started getting a mole that looked like it was turning into a melanoma,

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:15.600
 for example, turning blue and white, and the blue and white spots swimming around, changing

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:24.960
 positions rapidly, typical behavior of a melanoma, I would just apply a little either progesterone

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:32.840
 or DHEA to that area, and immediately the color, instead of swimming around in colored

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:40.960
 spots, would level out and become just a little tan colored thing, and then it would go away.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.760
 I had a series of experiments.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:53.220
 One was a mole as big as a jumbo olive that when I finally put some progesterone near

00:46:53.220 --> 00:47:02.200
 it, within two weeks it had turned to a crisp and fallen off without leaving a trace of

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:07.120
 a scar where this huge black thing had been.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:11.640
 I found that I could sort of steer them.

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.600
 They're extremely mobile, the pigment cells.

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:24.180
 A huge black thing appeared suddenly on my lower arm, and having the other experiences,

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:33.220
 I put a dot of progesterone in oil on the upside about an inch from the spot.

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.220
 Is that coconut oil?

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:40.220
 The next day there was, well, I think it was vitamin E and progesterone.

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:42.580
 Okay, thanks.

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:50.740
 The following day there was a shadow of it about an inch downstream towards my hand,

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:56.260
 and I put another dot on, and each time I put a dot on, the next day there would be

00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:05.780
 a shadow an inch farther down, so I had a series of three or four progressively fainter

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:12.540
 shadows, and each time a shadow moved out from it, the spot itself got fainter.

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:20.220
 And pretty soon all of the cells had walked away from the big black spot.

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:30.540
 And in another case, putting a dot on the front of one on my forehead, the pigment cells

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:37.220
 moved out in a circumference away from it, so it looked, on the third day it looked like

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:45.100
 a bull's eye, and after about a week, the original spot had shrunk up and pinched off

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.980
 at the base and left no scar.

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:51.420
 That's phenomenal.

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:58.100
 Various other people who didn't experiment in such detail would just take an overdose

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:06.700
 of thyroid for a week or two, and day by day you could see their mole shrinking until,

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:13.220
 in one case, a mole an inch long disappeared from a guy's back in two weeks.

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:17.740
 So you were just toying with it with that progesterone and pregnenolone.

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:25.580
 Yeah, very entertaining to see how fast these cells can run through your body.

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:36.220
 People have studied them on cover slips, and at 90 degrees, which is the average skin temperature,

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:44.700
 a cell of that type can walk about an inch per day if it's motivated.

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:50.620
 If you've got something to move it along, no loitering.

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:55.260
 I think the reason they collect in certain spots is that they come looking for something

00:49:55.260 --> 00:50:00.100
 that's missing from where they were.

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:03.420
 They're looking for some resource to take advantage of?

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:12.380
 Yeah, like they found some cell that was emitting DHEA possibly, and so everyone moves in to

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:13.380
 take advantage.

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:14.380
 I see.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:19.180
 And that's maybe what caused the mole to form in the first place.

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:29.180
 Yeah, some people just the last couple of months have been thinking about the factors

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:35.740
 that guide cell migration, and it's probably going to be a very interesting field in the

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:36.740
 next few years.

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:44.100
 Trying, for example, to lure cancer cells back from their metastatic positions, call

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:47.140
 them back to where they should be.

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:50.220
 That sounds much more civilized than what they do now.

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:52.660
 We do have a caller, Ray, and not very much time left.

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:56.060
 So caller, if you want to turn on your mic.

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.060
 Yeah.

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:59.740
 Yeah, thanks for doing that.

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:00.740
 And what's your question?

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:11.740
 Yeah, I wanted to talk about type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome and how it goes together

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:16.540
 with low testosterone and what's the best way to attack that.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:22.140
 Okay, we have about seven minutes.

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:31.220
 I've got some newsletters specifically on that, but getting the polyunsaturated fats

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:42.180
 out of your body as far as possible or keeping them in storage if they're there, but definitely

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:49.900
 avoiding all kinds of polyunsaturated fats because those are the things that specifically

00:51:49.900 --> 00:52:01.660
 interfere with the ability to oxidize glucose.

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:11.140
 One of the reasons that aspirin for 100 years has been known to help lower blood sugar in

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:20.700
 that kind of diabetes is that aspirin does several things to interrupt the effects of

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:23.220
 the polyunsaturated fats.

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:28.860
 It keeps them from turning into the inflammation causing prostate gland lens, but it also helps

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:35.260
 to keep them in storage where they don't do any harm or not so much harm.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.740
 All right.

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:39.780
 Caller, are you still there?

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.340
 Yeah, I'm here.

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:42.340
 Thank you for that.

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.860
 I wanted to know, does that also correlate into the weight loss because I found that

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:51.940
 as soon as weight is lost, the blood sugar starts regulating itself.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:53:02.420
 Yeah, the fat cells are sending out signals that create inflammation.

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:12.540
 Leptin is one of the pro-inflammatory signals that you want to signal your fat to stop sending

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.540
 leptin if possible.

00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.540
 All right.

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:18.580
 Thank you.

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.580
 Thanks for calling.

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:22.580
 Thank you very much.

00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:23.580
 Thank you.

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:29.420
 We have one more question that came in by email, Ray, and it says, that's from Jerry,

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:31.940
 I eat raw vegetables out of the garden all summer.

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:32.940
 Is that a no-no?

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:38.180
 I always thought raw veggies were more nutritious than cooked.

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:41.180
 It depends on what they are.

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:45.460
 Like peppers, for example, are really fruit.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:50.980
 Tomatoes and peppers are good raw.

00:53:50.980 --> 00:54:02.620
 And carrots and some of the radishes, for example, if you ate a lot of them, they would

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:04.660
 be antithyroid.

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:13.580
 But there are some things called vegetables that are really fairly rich in sugar as well

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:15.380
 as the minerals.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:24.460
 And so those sweetish root vegetables are pretty healthy.

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:32.580
 And the fruits, tomatoes and bell peppers in particular.

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.620
 As long as you're not nightshade intolerant.

00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:36.620
 Yeah.

00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:37.620
 Yeah.

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:43.500
 The allergy to those is a problem for a lot of people.

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.820
 You're not very big on some raw vegetables, is that right?

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.380
 Like beans and such?

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:50.380
 Yeah.

00:54:50.380 --> 00:55:00.340
 The raw stuff, it's likely to feed bacteria and cause problems.

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:10.780
 And if there is a seed developing in it, that has other specific toxins.

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:15.500
 Like peas and beans are not so great.

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:16.580
 Yeah.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:18.340
 And I really wanted to ask you about eczema.

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:21.700
 I was wondering if you had any tips for how to handle that.

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:25.940
 We only have a couple minutes.

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:32.060
 Keeping your intestine in good condition is one of the things.

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:39.980
 Both eczema and psoriasis tend to flare up in a lot of people when they eat bread or

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:42.420
 other grains.

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:46.060
 And beans are very hard on the intestine in general.

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:55.220
 But seeds, grains and beans irritating the intestine tend to create sympathetic reactions.

00:55:55.220 --> 00:56:08.220
 The particular enzyme that reacts to gluten is involved in the maturing of the skin cells.

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:16.820
 And so this particular enzyme is now being studied as a link between the intestine and

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:21.060
 the skin, the transglutamination enzymes.

00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:26.420
 And what can somebody do about eczema if they have it?

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:34.100
 Thyroid very often helps.

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:37.260
 With progesterone also, do you think?

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:38.260
 Yes.

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:48.140
 Very often, sometimes pregnenolone by balancing all of the others, it's the precursor to all

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:50.620
 of the steroid hormones.

00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:54.700
 And in itself it stops the stress reaction.

00:56:54.700 --> 00:57:03.300
 And to the extent that your stress system from pituitary to adrenals, it associates

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:10.620
 with a flare up of skin problems just by turning off the stress with pregnenolone.

00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:16.340
 You can see a big change in a lot of problems.

00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:18.460
 And well, we're actually out of time.

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.780
 So I can't go on even though I want to.

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:25.460
 Dr. Raymond Peet, it's been a real pleasure once again having you on the show.

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:31.300
 And thanks for doing such a marathon and handling all those questions so well.

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:32.300
 Really appreciate it.

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:33.300
 Okay, thank you.

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:35.220
 Okay, have a good night, Ray.

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:36.220
 Okay, bye.

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:37.220
 Yeah, bye bye.

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:43.900
 Well, it's hard to believe that sped by so quickly.

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:45.020
 I want to thank everybody.
