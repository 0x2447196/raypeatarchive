 Nothing is more expensive than bad information. Know the source. OneRadioNetwork.com

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Well, a very pleasant good day to you. Good morning. It is the 17th of May.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 This is Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 We have an interface kind of issue with my camera on the, so,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 but we think it's going to be back up and streaming tomorrow, so I'll be on camera, not that you need to see me.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 It is the information, but, you know, people like to watch stuff.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us this morning.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 He's a good one. He's been around the bend a very long time.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 When you talk about his work going all the way back to '68,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 when I was doing Armed Forces Radio, wow, '68, 50, over 50 years ago,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 and he was working with hormones and physiological chemistry and physics in '71 and '72,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 his PhD dissertation, University of Oregon in '72,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 and he outlined his ideas regarding progesterone and the hormone closely related to it

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 as protection of the body's structure and energy against harmful effects of estrogen,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 radiation stress, and lack of oxygen.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 We've had several people on the air, and Dr. Peat is one, including Dr. Wong, I think, last week,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 that says a little bit of progesterone.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Here and again is kind of good for you, and I think Dr. Peat developed a product some years ago.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 I think it's called Progest-Ease. We'll ask him and say hello.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Well, good morning, Dr. Peat. How are you, sir?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Good morning. Very, very well.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Yeah. Well, you're sounding good anyway.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 So a little bit of progesterone is good for us all every day.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Yeah. After I had studied it in the lab, I remembered that every time I handled it,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 I would stop having hangnails.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Ever since I worked in the lab using it, I've never had a hangnail,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 you know, those little inflamed, red, broken places where the skin sort of splits open.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 And that started me thinking about what other things it might do in those very trace amounts,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 and probably three or four years after I did my dissertation,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 I came across a woman who had what seemed to be a degenerative brain disease.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 They weren't sure whether it was optic neuritis or a deeper type of brain disease,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 but she somehow got the idea of progesterone being involved, I think,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 because of her cyclic symptoms getting worse.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 And she had been so bad that she was bedridden for six months at a time and never could.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 For, I guess, two or three years, she couldn't function properly.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 She needed water or would tend to get lost if she tried to go shopping.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 But she convinced a doctor to give her progesterone shots.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 That was 1975 or '76.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 And she started recovering just with a couple of the injections.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 And she kept convincing different doctors to keep giving it to her,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 and she recovered so completely that I asked her to do a talk to my endocrine class

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 at the Nature of Ethic Medical School.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 And it was in an old building two or three stories up,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 and so she had to drive through the city, find a parking place,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 and walk up two or three flights of stairs.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 And then she lectured the whole hour of the class, very well organized, extremely well informed.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 And she had supposedly had a degenerative brain condition.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 Interesting. Wow. So, would you say, looking back on this, Dr. Rapide,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 it wasn't necessarily a lack of progesterone that caused it,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 but that giving the progesterone will help the symptoms?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 How would you explain it?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Yeah, it stops the stress and puts the cells in a higher energy state of rest,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 simply letting things catch up.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 So that even if the original problem was, for example, radiation or poisoning

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 or a vitamin deficiency or a mineral deficiency,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 just by giving this rest period, whatever it was that was going wrong,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 the body could reorganize itself, catch up,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 accumulate some of the missing nutrients and so on, and become more efficient.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 So rest, so it's actually helping the cells just to settle down and be more parasympathetic?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 No, neither sympathetic nor parasympathetic, just in a state of readiness.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 And you don't need to resort to either of those pushers, the up or down push.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 The cell, it's sort of like a political autonomy.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 You don't have to be pushed this way or that way.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 When the cells are really highly energized and efficient,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 they can take care of themselves pretty much and can cooperate efficiently

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 rather than having to be bullied into becoming more active or more quiescent for sleeping and so on.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Are there things that we do or don't do in the diet arena that

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 cures the idea that we need to take a little bit of progesterone?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Are we missing something?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Yeah, just about anything we miss.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 The strange thing about progesterone is that it literally is good for everything.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 And that's the trouble of getting someone to understand how useful it can be,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 is because of the belief that everything has a particular cause and a particular cure.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 But in the case of a few things such as progesterone,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 it's a matter of stabilizing the cell or the organism in its resting state,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 letting it gather up its forces to go back and work on the particular problems.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 Well, it sounds like a real natural approach.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 I mean, you're not trying to kill anything or change anything, right?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 You're just helping the body to heal.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Yeah, exactly. It doesn't worry about killing germs or viruses or cancer cells.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 In the case of cancer cells, for example, skin cancer,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 I've seen people with diagnosed cancers on their lips or their ears,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 which they didn't want cut off or irradiated just because they were conspicuous.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 And just in a week or so, the thing would either close up, stop being a sore, or would fall off.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 Interesting. Wow.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 Now, you developed a product called Digest-Ease, and people can Google that and get it, right?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Is that right? Progest-Ease.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Progest-Ease.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 And there's another one other people are using, like a wild yam.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Is yours a wild yam derivative, the one that you developed?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Oh, that was about 70 years ago.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 They were making it from wild yams in Mexico.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 And I used to go to school right by the Syntex factory, and that got me curious.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 In the 1950s, they were already producing that and other hormones.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 But I didn't start working with it until more than 10 years after that.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 But the Progest-Ease is a yam derivative product?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 No, now they use whatever sources, economical.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 It just happens that the wild yam was a very abundant, cheap source.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 You could just go in the jungle and pull out these gigantic yams that were sometimes 20 or 30 pounds each.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 But does the body really care that this source, as long as it gets...

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 No, it goes through more than 20 chemical processes anyway.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 So it doesn't matter where it came from.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 You know, it's really interesting with talking to you all this time.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 I really appreciate it that you're not, you've never been really dogmatic against some different pharmaceuticals if they do the job.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 Is that accurate?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Right, yeah.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Because some of them do something, right?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 Yeah.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Antibiotics, after all, usually started with a natural substance.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 There are antibiotics in mushrooms as well as molds and in trees and fruits and so on.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Antibiotics are everywhere.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 So the idea that an antibiotic has to be a harmful drug is a misperception.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 The problem is that the drug companies are always wanting something more profitable.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 And so they discourage the use of the simple, abundant, safe materials and add a chlorine or fluorine atom to it and change its behavior and patent it and then promote it as the latest thing that is so good you should forget using the old antibiotics.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 But what they do is generally make it riskier, even though more powerful in some ways, they're also more harmful in some ways.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Yeah.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 There's a whole cadre of people, as you know, the Kauffmans and Cowans in the world and lots of them, Lancas in Germany, that are suggesting that even bacteria, like in the throat, the strep throat, the bacteria is trying to do its thing.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 And to use an antibiotic for that is just stopping the healing process.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 Does that resonate with you?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Yeah.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Basically, you should make the organism so healthy and happy that it makes its bacteria healthy and happy.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 But if you happen to have a rapidly growing bacteria in your throat that's hurting, a quick swish, rinsing an antibiotic over it can knock it out and give your body a chance to come back and keep it under control.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Oh, in other words, let's see, because they're arguing that the bacteria is really doing the healing, that if you kill it then you're just stuffing it somewhere else.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 But you're saying an antibiotic can actually not kill it all and just leave?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Yeah.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 Okay.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 There have been several studies going back decades in which once they identified that there was a harmful infection, they would give a minimal dose of the antibiotic and watch the symptoms.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Usually about a third to a half of the typically prescribed dose would get it under control quickly without hurting the body's immune system.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Interesting.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 And so the total dose, instead of continuing it for two weeks, as soon as they would see the symptoms subsiding, maybe in a few hours or maybe a day or a day and a half.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Interesting.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 And so as soon as the symptoms were gone, they would stop killing the bacteria and let the body's immune system take over.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Wow.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 That's pretty cool.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 And when was this?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 When did they do this?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 They'd figure this out?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 I was reading those papers in the 1980s.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 I'll be.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Boy, you don't hear much of that going around today, do you?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 No.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 Nobody talks about that.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 All they do is tell you to what?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 Take three weeks and use them all, right?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 Don't stop.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Just keep taking them.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Yeah.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 That's what gets people in trouble.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 They knock out the bacteria totally and then all of those remaining two weeks, what they're doing is weakening the body because these things are actually directly toxic to our own mitochondria and ribosomes

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 and various essential processes.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 They're more toxic to the bacteria, but they're still somewhat toxic.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 And so if you keep taking massive amounts of them, all you're doing is poisoning yourself a little more unnecessarily.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 So on the argument that if you do that and do the full course and you do what you just explained, does the initial insult on the body, is it still there?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Does it drive it deeper or whatever it is, some kind of poisoning or heavy metal or something?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 If you continue the antibiotic just a little beyond the disappearance of the symptoms, just taper off so that you are seeing that the thing isn't ready to have a great resurgence.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 And if it stays away when you've tapered off, then what you're doing is letting the body's natural immunity start to come back and take over and not let the bacteria set up business again.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 But if you go the other way and just really carpet bomb the whole thing, I guess I'm trying to understand, is there something that's still left in the body that can come back?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Yeah, their idea is that the spores will be there potentially to burst out again.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 The bacteria defend themselves and go into a spore state where they can resist a moderate amount of the antibiotic.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 So the idea is that you have to wait a certain, usually two weeks, in some cases three weeks of constant bombardment so that you get the last trace of it.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 It's like cancer therapy in which first you do surgery and then you use chemical poisons and then irradiate the body for good measure.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 It's an obsessive belief that the body is absolutely incapable of taking over at some point.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 So do you think there could be some judicious, really good, positive ways of using chemo if you really were careful?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Yeah, right at the same time I was reading those antibiotic studies, people were doing the same, advocating about a half to a third or a fourth of the potency of the chemotherapy and watching what's happening to the tumor.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 It's a matter of the balance between your body and the tumor and if you see the tumor shrinking, you don't want to hurt the body any more than necessary.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 They were having good results with simply trying to shift the balance in favor of the patient and against the tumor without obsessively trying to kill every last imagined cell.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 In fact, that idea of cancer being a matter of a seed, one evil cell that multiplies and becomes the cancer, that whole thing has never been a valid theory of cancer.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 The cancer is always involving the restorative healing processes of the organism being weakened and it's always a matter of gradation within a field of tissue organization and health.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 So the organism just doesn't get strong enough and then people get consumed by it and then they die "of cancer."

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Yeah, and just the last 10 years or so, the standard treatments are demonstrating that when you cut out a tumor or otherwise kill it or irradiate it to death, what you left is a wounded area of the organism and almost always that bad area is the one that's going to be the most damaged.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 That area is going to eventually produce more tumors if you haven't healed the body itself.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 Wow.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 The signal from a tumor goes out and recruits cells from the bone marrow and from its immediate neighborhood.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 These signals of injury are part of the normal healing process and in a healthy person, the injury recruits healthy volunteers and does a thorough job of repairing the injury.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 The cancer process is just a failed process of healing.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Failed in what way?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 The organism can't provide the energy or materials necessary to do a perfect healing job and so some sickness or inflammation remains in that area.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 For example, any injury among the signals that it's causing is estrogen.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Irritation or lack of oxygen or any stress activates the aromatase enzyme making estrogen and the estrogen stimulates cell multiplication and amplifies the inflammation.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 If the body can't produce massive amounts of the quieting substances including progesterone, which should come in and turn off the production of estrogen, then the tumor is able to keep growing as a wound that can't heal.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 So then anybody with this thing called cancer, they would do everything they can to stay off of high estrogenic foods would be one thing?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Yeah, that's helpful.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 The injured tissue becomes such a powerful source of estrogen.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 The important thing is to do everything possible to reduce the local production of estrogen.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 Even in the precancerous state like in ductal carcinoma in situ in the breast, that's a familiar place that doesn't look like cancer at the beginning but it does tend over the years to develop into a cancer.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 Even at the earliest stages of that, just because the tissue is irritated, you can see the appearance of aromatase locally producing estrogen right there at the seat of the irritation or the failure to heal properly.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 So everything of the organism should be directed to restoring the energy so it stops making the estrogen locally.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 The concentration of estrogen at an irritated site like that is internally, the source is so intense locally that what happens in your diet or in the system in general, that estrogen is relatively mild and ineffective.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 Compared to what's produced locally.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 So is that one of the reasons why maybe soy and high estrogen foods are generally not best choices in general to eat?

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 Yeah, that gives you a background inclined in that direction.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Dr. Peat, stay right there.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us and we're going to dig into your emails.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Man, he's fun to talk to, huh?

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 It's great when you have a guy around the house who's studied this stuff.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 If you'd like to be on the show, we have lots of emails, but we're going to get to as many as we can.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 The colostrum is still on sale.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 I think we have another, I don't know, maybe a few more days.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 So check it out though.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 No promo code needed.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 Previously, we asked Dr. Anthony Kleinschmidt, who formulates the colostrum for survival, which is on sale.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 Is it really anti-aging?

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 Oh gosh, you have all of those natural growth factors that are found there.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 And they've been shown through a lot of research to actually bring you into a younger, more youthful state.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 And the fun thing about our colostrum through survival is that it's all natural.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 There's nothing else added.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 And you all get this at what time during the whole process of the cows giving birth?

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 From zero to six to eight hours after birth.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Remember, colostrum is only produced one time, four to six weeks prior to birth.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 We take it, we make sure that the calf gets their fill, we take the remainder.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 It's really yummy and easy to take.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Just warm water or smoothies.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 It's on sale right now.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 It is, and it's 20% off.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 And you don't need a promo code.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 Just go on Survival through our website.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 And I think it's another three or four days.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 I'll have to check, but you'll see the sale.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 So don't wait.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 If you'd like to get some colostrum, it's just a great product.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 It's fun.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 It tastes great.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 It looks great.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Everything is great about it.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 I just love it.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 You put it in your smoothies and rock and roll and just have some fun.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 Hold on a second.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Here, let me do this.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 Okay.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 And I should know exactly when it's--

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 But I'll check it out.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 Oops.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Okay.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 I got it.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Previously on our show, we talked to the now legendary Dr. Dietrich Klinghart.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 And he mentioned sulfur.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 He's a fan.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 And he said the conditions in our world and our environment are changing so dramatically

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 that people need to have a whole host of self-help tools and methods.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 And I'm very thrilled about your version of MSM.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 It's the right way to go.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 You know, sulfur is part of most of the detox enzymes.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 And then the critical part that is right now we have a much, much higher need of healthy sulfur

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 than we had even 10 years ago.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 And so I followed your work a little bit.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 You're on the right track with what you are promoting.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 Well, Dr. Klinghart, we've heard from thousands of people over the year how they really love this product.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 Very low EMFs.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 You'll sweat.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 It's the far infrared rays are the real deal.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 And detoxification, you do it every day, every day, every day.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 Just do it and make sure you have plenty of water and, you know, your little electrolytes,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 electromyolites, and you rock and roll.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 Check it out.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Email me if you'd like to get one of these saunas.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 They're really good.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 We are listener supported.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 OneRadioNetwork.com

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 We are talking, have the honor to talk to Dr. Ray Peat every month on the third Monday

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000

 And you get your newsletter.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 And that's every few months, right, Dr. Peat?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Yeah.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Pretty cool.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 You want to jump into some emails?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 We got a, that's going to take you all over the place today.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 This is from Alice in Alabama.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 Dear Dr. Peat, I really like radicchio and it's high in vitamin E and K.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 Do you think it's good to eat, ongoing, radicchio?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 Yeah, I think so.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 Why not?

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 Here's Sophie.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 She's in Baltimore.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 I have two skin tag questions for Dr. Peat.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 How to get rid of blackheads and how to shrink pores.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Are blackheads skin tags?

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 No.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 No.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 A blackhead is the oily material with some dead cells mixed in with it.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 And the reason it's typically dark colored is that it has polyunsaturated fats in the

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 skin oil that oxidize and turn dark.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 And so it's actually stuff that should have been secreted in a liquid form.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 But with things like a vitamin A deficiency in which your skin cells become obstructions

00:29:48.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 to the secretion of oils, sometimes a disturbance of your thyroid gland combined with the vitamin

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 A deficiency will create more blockage in the pores.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 And those, by being stationary, edible material, become potential food for bacteria and potential

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 pimple or boil formation.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 So it's important to find out why you're secreting too much oil and shedding too many keratinized

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 skin cells.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 And usually a good diet and checking your thyroid level will correct those and the pores

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 will gradually return to normal size when you're not plugging them up anymore.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 So when the kids get these things, blackheads and stuff, it's just going to Burger Doodle

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 and things like that and just bad food and fats and stuff.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 Yeah, probably.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 Here is Vic.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 I'm not sure where he is.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Have you had, oh, I have had heart arrhythmias for about two weeks now, various patterns,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 and haven't really changed anything that might cause them.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 I'm 70, a male.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 I like to avoid medical and cure myself.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 What besides magnesium would Dr. Peate recommend to kind of normalize it from Ty?

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Oh, thank you, Ty.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 The progesterone and related steroids, DHEA, progesterone, and pregnenolone are all stabilizers

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 of the heart rhythm and of the blood vessel tone, and all of those decrease progressively

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 with aging, and usually a declining thyroid after the age of about 40 or 50, the thyroid

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 is becoming less active, less responsive, and so that produces less conversion of cholesterol

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 to these protective steroids.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 So if your cholesterol is 250 or 300, that means just by increasing thyroid activity,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 you could produce a lot more of the protective steroids which have a heart stabilizing and

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 blood vessel.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 So these things you mentioned, the DHEA and all that, they are in the, the body makes

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 them when we have enough cholesterol.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Yeah, thyroid, vitamin A, and cholesterol are needed to make the protective steroids,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:10.640
 and especially DHEA and progesterone have a natural mild digitalis-like action, strengthening

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.200
 of the heart beat and rhythm.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:24.040
 And when your progesterone and DHEA decline because of that intrinsic digitalis-like effect,

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:33.120
 what remains is the intracellularly produced estrogen, and estrogen has the opposite of

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.880
 the digitalis effect.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:45.520
 So that if you imagine the stimulated heart, as it increases the need to pump harder, it

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.680
 also gets a bigger stroke volume.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:55.960
 It pumps both harder and faster when it has the natural protective steroids, and estrogen

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:10.040
 knocks out that ability to respond to a greater need by increasing both velocity and volume

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.040
 of pumping.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:22.120
 And so you get a tendency to sort of collapse into a very weak shock-like pulse momentarily

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:26.480
 until you can gather up the stabilizing steroids.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:37.600
 And one of the effects of estrogen is to also delay the readiness of the heart to beat again,

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:50.000
 and so the dangerous arrhythmia is called a QT prolongation or a slow QT wave.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:58.720
 That's just because the estrogen and many other things that interfere with energy production

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:07.640
 cause the heart to become delayed in its ability to respond to the next beat, and progesterone

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:13.280
 and DHEA happen to be the QT shorteners.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:18.240
 They aren't more quickly ready to beat again.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.760
 So would this give some real, even more, a little bit of credence to more of Cowan's

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.920
 idea that the heart is not necessarily the thing that's pumping everything around the

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:31.960
 body, that it's all the blood vessels and the, what's the guy's name, Pollard, you

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.720
 know, and the fourth phase of water, and it's the blood vessels, and they're happy, and

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.520
 they're moving things around the body?

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:47.840
 Yeah, all of the veins converge back to the torso and the vena cava, for example.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:57.880
 If it goes limp, a large part of the returned blood pools in this big vein in your body

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:07.200
 before it gets to the heart, and so the heart isn't receiving a fair share of the returning

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.520
 blood, and so it has a weak heartbeat.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:18.120
 That's one of the effects of a shift towards estrogen away from DHEA and progesterone,

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:26.840
 and the tone of the vena cava goes limp, blood pools, and doesn't get to the heart, and so

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:38.400
 you have a rapid, weak heartbeat, and what you need to do is tighten up your vein wall

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:48.280
 muscles so that the veins don't simply hold the idle blood, but they squeeze it back into

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:57.440
 the heart, and when the vena cava pours its blood into the heart, then the heart can have

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.160
 a strong, full beat.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:05.280
 And we strengthen those how?

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:11.080
 Keeping the stress physiology, keeping the energy level up, which means keeping the ratio

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:18.520
 of progesterone to estrogen high in favor of progesterone dominance.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:24.040
 And then psychological fear, worry, angst, confusion, that can mess with those guys,

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.040
 right?

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.040
 Yeah.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.040
 For sure.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.040
 Yeah.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.040
 Wow.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.800
 So, we have a question now for you from, "What do you recommend for acid reflux and

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.120
 preventing ulcers?

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:40.280
 Also, how do I convince my parents who are both diabetic that drinking orange juice and

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:44.800
 Mexican Coke actually could be good for them?

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.520
 I tell them it could help reduce the cortisol in my body, but they won't buy it."

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.920
 Okay, so he's got acid reflux and ulcers.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:58.440
 What's the first go-to guy for Hussain, H-U-S-S-A-I-N-E in Dallas?

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:08.440
 I think the first thing is to make sure your intestine is moving along rhythmically.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:17.840
 The average American takes about 76 hours for food to move from the mouth to the excretion.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.840
 Really?

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:28.160
 Yeah, and in Africa, in some areas, they've timed it on an average of 12 hours of very

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:36.000
 vigorous intestine action when you're active and eating fibrous food.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.800
 And so, just increasing the amount of safe fiber in your food can stimulate the intestine

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.320
 and keep peristalsis going in the right direction.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:55.280
 When you're very hypothyroid and when your blood sugar falls during the night, that creates

00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:04.360
 a stress signal, a mixture of parasympathetic and sympathetic signals to the intestine,

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:09.560
 causing the peristalsis rhythm to get deranged.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:15.280
 And instead of moving from your mouth through your stomach to the intestine...

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.280
 It goes the other way.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:21.520
 It goes the other way and you get a flow backwards.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:34.400
 And many years ago, a gastroenterologist experimented on his medical students by inserting a marker

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:43.120
 into their rectums and then the next morning, taking a swab of their saliva, and they found

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:53.000
 that the students who normally woke up with bad breath and a bad-tasting mouth, they found

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.560
 the markers had migrated backwards into their mouth.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:10.560
 So it was the habitual intestinal rhythm of a fair percentage of even a very healthy population

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.960
 like medical students.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:18.080
 There was a nocturnal reversal of peristalsis.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:23.440
 So what do we do or take during the middle of the night or before bed to help that nocturnal

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:28.720
 reversal go the other way where it's supposed to and then the acid thing will settle down?

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:35.360
 Keeping your blood sugar up is the first thing because the stress of nocturnal hypoglycemia

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:41.560
 is what excites your intestine in a random way.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:46.200
 It's like a frenzy of activity that goes in all directions.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:51.760
 So is that a call for more, that would be orange juice over say milk?

00:40:51.760 --> 00:41:01.080
 Both milk and orange juice are very helpful because the calcium in the milk has a variety

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.320
 of calming effects.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.820
 Wow, pretty fascinating.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.480
 So that's the real acid reflex thing is what's going on.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.360
 Things are getting backed up.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:18.160
 And behind that, most often there's a thyroid deficiency leading to an imbalance of all

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.920
 of the other hormones.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:28.880
 But milk and orange juice and fiber in the diet are the first aids that will help while

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.960
 you study your thyroid situation.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.080
 Wow, interesting.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.440
 It's the 17th of May.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.440
 We're live here.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.560
 Patrick Timpone.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:41.880
 It's about 18 minutes after noon central time.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.160
 Tom Luongo joins us tomorrow.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:47.320
 We're going to talk about everything from Bitcoin to potentially new Fedcoin to all

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:52.760
 kinds of things, China, Russia, and he's on it and he's fun to talk to.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.760
 This is from Ellen.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:42:01.440
 What does Dr. Peat think of the natural supplementation of NAC, which the FDA is apparently going

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.720
 to make a prescription only?

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:07.240
 What is the chemical?

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.240
 NAC.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.240
 N-A-C.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:14.400
 I'm not sure what that is.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.400
 I used to know what that is.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.400
 Acetylcysteine?

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.840
 That's right.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.760
 I think I can Google it here, but I think it's a short term.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:29.440
 Let me just put in here NAC so you know what it is.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.640
 It's nenylcysteine, something like that.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:40.640
 I think it's NAC supplements for building strong immune system.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.000
 N-A-C-E-T-Y-L-O-C-Y-S-T-E-I-N.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 Yeah.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 Yeah.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:56.560
 That does have protective antioxidant effects, but you have to remember that a basic molecule

00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:07.360
 is cysteine and too much cysteine or methionine, the related sulfur amino acid.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:16.640
 These are potential cytotoxic life-threatening amino acids that you don't want to chronically

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.200
 overdose on.

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.200
 Right.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.200
 Okay.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.200
 Gotcha.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.200
 Gotcha.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.200
 Gotcha.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.200
 Gotcha.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.200
 Here's an interesting one.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:31.880
 The father of a dad, he's 57, had a blood pressure of about 155 over 95 consistently

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.440
 on waking up.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.880
 His vitamin D is 50 NG/ML.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:41.560
 He started drinking a quarter and a half of milk and his blood pressure rose 175 over

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.560
 105.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.680
 He has no digestion problems with the milk.

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.080
 When he stopped drinking the milk, his blood pressure dropped back down to the level.

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:53.760
 Can Dr. Peticks offer any clues to why this could be happening here?

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:58.240
 Why would milk do that?

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.760
 If it was a sudden change of diet...

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.440
 That can do it, right?

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.440
 Yeah.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:09.560
 The stomach just takes a while to adapt to a new food, but that's a very high pressure

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:15.920
 for early in the morning and it usually means that they have become dehydrated during the

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.960
 night.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:27.760
 If they would start taking their milk or juice at bedtime or during the night to prevent

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:36.440
 the nocturnal dehydration, you should pretty much stop forming urine during the night.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:45.680
 But if your kidneys keep working, then you're going to have dehydrated blood by morning

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:50.200
 and that will increase your blood pressure.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:55.880
 Even drinking water during the night helps to prevent the morning high blood pressure.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:56.880
 Interesting.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.080
 Here's a question for Dr. Peat from Mike.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:06.640
 For those who must be COVID vaccinated, is it helpful to take blood thinning substances

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:13.240
 like aspirin or maybe vitamin E to help mitigate blood clotting risk with the use of vitamin

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:18.320
 KB, detrimental for those at risk for blood clots?

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:27.920
 Vitamin K not only facilitates the production of pro-clotting agents in the liver, but it

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:39.120
 also is necessary for two very important anti-clotting agents, protein C and S. And so it isn't the

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:45.040
 clot vitamin, it's the coagulation regulatory vitamin.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:53.520
 And the deficiency of protein S and C is going to cause a tendency to spontaneous clotting

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:57.160
 problems.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:08.120
 And all of the nutrients with some regulation of the platelets or the clotting system or

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:15.600
 the blood sugar, all of these things are going to reduce inflammation, protective against

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:25.200
 the COVID infection itself or equally protective against the vaccine because the vaccine is

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:31.160
 simply giving you the toxic part of the virus.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:37.200
 So anything anti-inflammatory is likely to be protective against the vaccine and COVID

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.200
 infection.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:43.840
 There's some folks that are saying that this injection messes with the shikimate pathway,

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:48.960
 which has been something that Dr. Seneff has talked about with the glyphosates.

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.120
 Can you explain what the shikimate pathway is?

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.640
 No, I haven't read about it for a long time.

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:58.400
 Long time, yeah.

00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.800
 Here's an email for you.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:10.960
 Black proteins are supposed to exist in cell membranes, but do cell membranes even exist?

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.760
 Is it true according to PubMed this person says fluorescent nanoparticles are present?

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.120
 Oh, that's the second part.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.440
 Yeah, let's do this first part.

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.520
 Do cell membranes even exist?

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:23.560
 No, that's a long story.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:33.040
 But it was something made up in the 1940s to counter all of the relevant evidence.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:41.160
 It was simply steamroller science down.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:48.680
 One very persistent researcher, Gilbert Ling, over and over kept demonstrating that it's

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:56.080
 a nonsensical, impossible concept, but still the language is there and it's in the textbooks

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.960
 and on the internet.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:07.320
 This imaginary membrane full of pumps and channels and such, you have to remember that

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:12.720
 it's a metaphor at best, a very bad metaphor.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.520
 So why is that important to us knowing that?

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:18.320
 What does that mean to us with cells?

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:30.080
 That partly the idea that the virus can only enter when it has a doorknob like the ACE2

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.000
 enzyme on the surface of a cell.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:41.840
 In fact, it's been demonstrated to have other ways of entering a cell.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:53.120
 Partly the idea of a membrane serves industry to convince drug companies or to convince

00:48:53.120 --> 00:49:03.800
 the public that you need some special technology to get a drug into your cell.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:15.120
 Even giant molecules like naked DNA molecules, a huge string of a rigid molecule, if you

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:27.840
 rub native DNA into your skin, it shows up inside the circulatory system in your lymph

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:36.880
 nodes and lining of the blood vessels, identifiable as the type of naked DNA that you rubbed into

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.480
 your skin.

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:46.560
 If you put it into a culture dish, it simply falls right into the cell.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.840
 It doesn't need an invitation.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:50:01.720
 Cells are selectively permeable but extremely permeable to the right kind of substance.

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:13.880
 The idea of a blood-brain barrier is partly based on the idea of the barrier membrane,

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:20.160
 but it really is a matter of the solubility difference between the brain substance and

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.960
 the blood substance.

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:28.240
 The brain is a big ball of fat and the blood is watery.

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:32.800
 Water-soluble things just don't want to dissolve in the brain.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.880
 It's the same as in the cell.

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.960
 Oily things are taken up by the cells.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:48.320
 Similarly, if you put an oily emulsion into your carotid artery, a very large percentage

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:55.520
 of it is going right into your brain on the first pass through your head.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:00.720
 There's no barrier functional to oily substances.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.120
 It's just a matter of solubility.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:12.320
 That same thing happens on every cell in relation to its environment.

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:18.520
 It's always selecting things that are more soluble and excluding things that are less

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.520
 soluble.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:24.320
 There are people that are out there, Dr. Peat, suggesting that the glyphosate thing, albeit

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:31.120
 a problem, could not be as bad as we're being told because it is a water-soluble thing and

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.360
 it's going to leave the body.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.600
 Do you think that's true?

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.600
 Right.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:43.840
, and it tends to stay out of vitamin E, for example.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:56.440
 If you use an oily herbicide or pesticide on your crop, that's going to show up in the

00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:02.200
 oily part of your crop production such as vitamin E.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:12.960
 So actually, as far as glyphosate goes, glyphosate is very bad because it's poisonous in a variety

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:23.440
 of ways, but it happens to be excluded from oils, from vegetable oils and vitamin E and

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:27.200
 so on just because it's water-soluble.

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:33.080
 So is vitamin E then protective against glyphosate?

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:42.440
 Not particularly, but you don't have to worry about the source of your olive oil being free

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:51.400
 of glyphosate because it doesn't tend to get into oily materials.

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:59.040
 But it can be on your cotton or your fruit or grains and so on.

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:04.480
 So can it be into our conventional orange juice that we love?

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:07.680
 I've never heard of it being used around oranges.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:08.680
 Oh really?

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:09.680
 Oh, cool.

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:10.680
 I hope not.

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:15.480
 It's hard to get organic orange juice, man.

00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:16.480
 Here's an interesting one.

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:23.240
 It's true, according to PubMed, fluorescent nanoparticles are present in Coca-Cola and

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.320
 Pepsi-Cola.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.320
 Fluorescent nanoparticles?

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.960
 I haven't heard of it.

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.960
 Me neither.

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:32.320
 It's a new one.

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:33.720
 Here's one for you.

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:38.560
 What are normal levels of thyroid for a 26-year-old woman?

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:46.680
 My older sister did her TSH, T4F, T3 test and her doctor said that she's fine but still

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:50.360
 feeling coldness and numbness in her hands and her feet.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:56.040
 Do you have off the top of your head some of your levels on some of these things?

00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:04.280
 The thing the thyroid does is make your metabolism run, consume oxygen, and if you aren't consuming

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:13.200
 oxygen, it's a fairly good chance that you don't have enough thyroid.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:20.240
 It's the basic thing that makes us produce heat by consuming oxygen.

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:30.160
 No matter whether you have the same amount of those chemicals detected in your blood,

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:36.320
 if it isn't activating the cells, then you can still be hypothyroid.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:54.240
 The TSH number ranges from 0.5 to 5.0, according to many official sources, and that range can

00:54:54.240 --> 00:55:04.240
 cover everything from a very warm, active person to a very sluggish, cold, hypometabolic

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:11.320
 person usually around TSH of 4.

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:19.160
 They're almost always suffering from fairly obvious hypothyroid symptoms.

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:26.360
 So it's a matter of whether you want to please your doctor or whether you want to metabolize

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:32.120
 energetically.

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.080
 This is interesting.

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:38.320
 This is from Elena.

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:46.520
 She says, "I am 55 years old in good health, no issues, but every now and then I get swelling,

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:51.360
 what is called edema, in my feet, sometimes one, sometimes two.

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:55.680
 It doesn't last very long, but I want to know the root cause of this.

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.040
 If Dr. Peat can tell me why it is doing this."

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.040
 What's that hooked up to?

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:02.560
 Is it a kidney thing, edema?

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.360
 Yeah, that's part of it.

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:12.080
 Sometimes it's a very simple thing in your diet corresponding to your hormones.

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:16.880
 At the age of 55, people are still cycling.

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:22.920
 It doesn't matter that you're not having visible menstrual cycles, but still the brain and

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.280
 the pituitary tend to cycle.

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:37.960
 So lots of women in their 50s will have the typical premenstrual water retention symptoms.

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:43.760
 All that's needed is to salt your food to taste.

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:51.640
 In pregnancy, they used to restrict sodium so they wouldn't gain weight during pregnancy.

00:56:51.640 --> 00:57:01.320
 The problem was that the high estrogen people who were usually low thyroid weren't able

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:11.560
 to retain the sodium in their kidneys and their body fluids became diluted and the amount

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:22.800
 of albumin in the blood tends to be lost when you don't have enough sodium to hold the confirmation

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:26.280
 of the albumin molecule proper.

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:35.720
 The edema goes with loss of sodium and albumin in the urine and also the entry of albumin

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:41.000
 and sodium into your tissues with the water.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:48.720
 If you had more sodium available running through your system, that would stabilize the albumin

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:56.560
 in your bloodstream and attract the water out of your tissues such as your feet where

00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:04.520
 it goes by gravity and circulate the water through your kidneys so that the water could

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:13.360
 be moved out of your body without losing the combination of sodium and magnesium.

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:21.440
 Setting the estrogen down makes you able to produce more albumin and to retain more sodium

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:30.600
 so that the water is properly distributed, pulling it into your bloodstream and carrying

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:32.600
 it to the kidneys.

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:34.600
 Wow, fascinating.

00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:35.600
 Wow.

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:40.120
 All these little pieces, parts are all connected up, aren't they, Dr. Peat?

00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:43.800
 We really have to be clever these days to understand these bodies.

00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:46.840
 We appreciate your input on these things.

00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:53.200
 If one was to receive a prostate cancer diagnosis, writes Michael, what would be the best course

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:58.760
 of action, in your opinion, to prevent it from becoming metastasized?

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:05.920
 Would use of testosterone, DHT, or progesterone be recommended?

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:15.840
 All of those, if you're sure that your thyroid is functioning properly and that you aren't

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:28.960
 likely to turn your testosterone into estrogen, and aspirin is a very competent way to suppress

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:35.960
 aromatase and protect your testosterone or DHEA from turning into estrogen.

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:40.960
 You got a little bare aspirin, just a bare aspirin.

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:41.960
 Yeah.

00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:54.240
 More than 20 years ago, doctors started realizing that with the diagnosis of prostate cancer,

00:59:54.240 --> 01:00:03.360
 they had seen the increased diagnosis using the PSA antigen, and following that increased

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:08.840
 diagnosis, the death rate went up sharply.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:16.120
 As a result of that, the prostate specialist started realizing that not treating diagnosed

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:26.560
 prostate cancer was usually the best policy, "watchful waiting," they called it, because

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:35.120
 it can take 20 years or so for a diagnosable prostate cancer to become harmful.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:49.320
 Meanwhile, you have the opportunity to prevent metastatic spread of it, and aspirin and progesterone

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:56.360
 and DHT are probably all protective against metastasis.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:01.520
 Would you do just one of the little bare, what are they, 250, or could you do even baby

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:05.080
 aspirin, or how much would you take?

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:09.320
 As much as your stomach agrees with.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.000
 Really?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.440
 Could be two or three 500 milligram tablets per day.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.440
 Really?

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.440
 That's a lot.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.320
 But just so you're telling me you like it, okay, so you eat it with food, you put them

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.320
 with food?

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.320
 Yeah.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.320
 Because what does it do to the tummy?

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.560
 It can upset it?

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.200
 Yeah.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:34.360
 It's only three or four percent of the people that have problems, and most of them, if they

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:40.360
 took enough vitamin K, they wouldn't have the bleeding problems in their stomach.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.360
 Vitamin K, huh?

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.360
 That's pretty interesting.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.360
 Stay right there, Doc.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.600
 We're going to do a couple little breaks before we go.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:53.680
 Dr. Ray Peat, well, that calls for a little plug for Daniel Vitalis' product.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:02:01.000
 He has a vitamin D K2 thing, so if you want to get some vitamin D K2 thing, you can go

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.960
 to Daniel Vitalis' Sirthrival website and get yourself a little K in there, and vitamin

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.600
 D. I like to get out in the sun.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:18.000
 I think I have plenty, but sometimes people want to even kind of check it out and test

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
 it and all that.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.760
 But Sirthrival's got the colostrum on sale, and they have elk velvet antler and pine pollen,

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:32.840
 and then the vitamin D3 K2 product, and it's all from very, very nice ingredients.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.200
 Just all kinds of really luscious stuff.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.440
 No chems, nothing like that.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.440
 Just really cool.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.520
 So you might want to explore that on OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.520
 Here's our sauna.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:52.200
 Previously with Dr. Thomas Rau, the Pericles Medical Clinic in Switzerland, their specialty

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.120
 is detoxification.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.720
 We asked him about FAR infrared saunas.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:02.920
 The FAR infrared sauna goes much deeper into the skin subcutaneously.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:09.320
 It has its maximum about four to five centimeters below the skin surface.

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:13.160
 You've actually measured materials in the sweat, and you've proven this.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.160
 Yes.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:19.760
 The patients after a week doing this every day, half an hour or 45 minutes, they react

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.400
 quite much with sweat.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:27.600
 Then you can collect this sweat, then you measure this, and then you find how much they

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.360
 detoxify with the heavy metals.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.360
 It's really amazing.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.720
 It really is kind of amazing, isn't it?

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.120
 You actually measure the sweat.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.120
 It's great.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.560
 Boy, I love this.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:43.160
 What I like to do is do the sauna, even in the middle of the night if I wake up or something,

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:52.080
 and then just run and do in a cold shower and just cold shower, cold shower, cold shower.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.080
 Boy, it's fun.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:58.080
 Really, really, really pretty fun.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:01.960
 It's only cold for a few seconds.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:07.040
 Previously with Dr. Charles Gant, MD, about, yep, sulfur.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:11.440
 I just wanted to say, Patrick, that I heard during the break talking to Dr. Stephanie.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.320
 I'm a big fan of her.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.320
 Are you really?

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.320
 She's great.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:20.080
 This sulfur transferase thing and the glyphosate, then there's also a genetic predisposition

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.080
 to this as well?

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.080
 Yes.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.280
 Oh, that could complicate matters too for those on GMO foods, huh?

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.280
 Exactly.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:33.000
 But now that we're in this toxic age with the glyphosate and the massive sulfur deficiencies,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.160
 and generally I recommend a little MSM, 500 milligrams, one twice a day for just about

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:44.560
 everybody just to get some basic organic sulfur on board.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.120
 Do you feel like it helps them to get some of this yuck stuff out and clean out the trash?

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.680
 Oh, boy, that's the whole point.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:54.400
 Well, I can see that sulfur is a conjugator of toxins.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.440
 Sulfur transferase transfers the sulfur.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:00.640
 Sulfur has a love affair with heavy metals and other toxins.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:06.560
 So I mean, I saw that right from the beginning, and so I just assumed that a little bit of

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.960
 sulfur could help just about anybody.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.200
 Well, maybe you should take a little every day.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:19.120
 You can click and order Pure Sulfur right on the front page of OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:22.920
 Previously with our friend Brandon Amelani of Shen Blossom.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:26.840
 A good example of this also is like the Hoshuwu formula.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.160
 That is a new one that came out.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.720
 It's really good because it's a blood builder.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:35.480
 A lot of people don't understand that Hoshuwu is actually toxic if it's not prepared correctly.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:39.720
 So I wanted to come out with one that not only features the Hoshuwu as the king herb

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.360
 in the formula, but it's prepared at the minimum of 14 days.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.480
 Usually we try and get 20, 21 days of cooking it.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:50.520
 So you can think of it as like it's in a slow cooker with black beans, and it's basically

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:53.960
 just cooking down and deactivating some of those liver toxic compounds.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:59.320
 So we do use that as the bulk of the formula, but we basically put a lot of mature ginseng

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.080
 root in our root extract.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:05.560
 We have the fermented and hydrolyzed pearl powder, reishi stem, and it's got shu di

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.640
 hong, which is like a ramania type family.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:11.360
 We have both the prepared warm stuff and then the cool stuff to kind of balance it out in

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.040
 a sense so it doesn't become sticky.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:17.240
 If you get a good quality Hoshuwu that's properly prepared, it definitely has some invigorating

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:21.840
 qualities to it and makes you feel relaxed, but yet fully vigorous and energized.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:25.800
 Now that's the kind of Hoshuwu that you would like, right?

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.240
 Really nice products as you can hear.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:32.800
 If you'd like to order Hoshuwu or the other products, click on Shen Blossom right there

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:36.080

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:45.520
 Nice way to support Dr. Ray Peat.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:50.640
 He does this all for freebies, but I don't think he's probably...

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:55.400
 You're not selling a lot of your artwork to famous galleries and getting like uber rich,

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.400
 are you?

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.400
 No.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.400
 Just kidding.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:02.840
 You could do rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com and support him.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.920
 It's very inexpensive.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:11.480
 Your last one was on the whole thing about dying and chi and energy and everything.

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.480
 No.

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.760
 No, it wasn't?

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:18.000
 Oh, because I haven't read it yet, but I got it a few days ago.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.240
 I thought that's what it was about.

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.240
 Oh.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.240
 No, no.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:26.320
 What was the title of it?

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.320
 Something about...

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:30.960
 Because you were saying your newest one was going to be about why we die and the loss

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.480
 of energy and that kind of thing.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.480
 I thought that's...

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:41.160
 Oh, well, the other direction, really.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:55.040
 The development as the intention of our individual selves and their purposes being sort of the

01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:06.080
 democratic approach to what the whole organism is doing, looking at the parts as full participants

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.840
 in the purpose of the organism.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:21.040
 It's a perspective on development and recuperation as well as the process of aging.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.040
 Yeah.

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:26.240
 I just signed up, I think I got the first one, I guess about a week ago.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.600
 I just haven't read it yet.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.600
 Cool.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:33.880
 But you can go to raypeat's newsletter at gmail.com.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.200
 Here's an email for you.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:41.800
 Oh, please address how it's possible that orange juice and Mexican Coke could actually

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:46.200
 help someone with type 2 diabetes.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:54.680
 Well, if you look at the actual mechanisms going on in diabetes, the polyunsaturated

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:59.000
 fatty acids are the real villain.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:08.280
 Looking at the functions of the pancreas itself, the beta cells that make insulin are constantly

01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:18.000
 regenerating and as soon as they regenerate, they are quickly killed by the oxidative damage

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.760
 done by the circulating fatty acids.

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:27.640
 But the regeneration is supported by glucose.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:33.800
 So if you keep your glucose up, you're going to have constantly regenerated beta cells

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:43.360
 in the pancreas and the problem is how not to kill them with an excess of fatty acids.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:56.080
 If you look at a population like Israel, the first generation immigrants to Israel from

01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:12.560
 North Africa were free of diabetes, but as soon as they adapted and became fully adjusted

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:23.360
 and started eating the European diet, that was the common standard in Israel, their diabetes

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:27.560
 level came right up to the European level.

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:37.080
 So it was the availability of vegetable oil, polyunsaturated oils that made them adapt

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:43.640
 and become diabetic where they had been completely free of diabetes.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:51.120
 And animal experiments, if you make them, starve them for these so-called essential

01:10:51.120 --> 01:11:03.520
 fatty acids until you can't detect a significant amount in their blood, then if you poison

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:12.320
 their pancreas and try to create diabetes, they are extremely resistant.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:21.880
 All of these, both the internal mechanism, the individuals demonstrated resistance to

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:29.400
 becoming diabetic and the population level where a whole population adapts, all of these

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:38.800
 show that it's the polyunsaturated fats, not the carbohydrates that cause the development

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.920
 of the so-called diabetes problem.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:51.120
 So that's, we call them PUFAs, so that would be all oils like canola and wesson and, right?

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.120
 All these oils.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:12:03.160
 Yeah, corn oil, canola, soybean oil, they're all good diabetes manufacturers.

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:08.640
 And it would make sense, Dr. Peat, because, I mean, if you look in the foods, I'm sure

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.920
 they're, I would suspect they're all over, fast foods, wouldn't they be?

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:16.200
 And fries and burgers and whatever, right?

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.280
 And then any processed food, I mean, it's hard to find even an organic one that doesn't

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.800
 want to put canola oil in it.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:22.800
 I mean, it's everywhere, right?

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.440
 Yeah, and it's the same with obesity.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.920
 Yeah, a lot.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:39.200
 The population is shifting towards an increasingly diabetogenic, obesogenic diet with PUFA.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.840
 So these things just weren't made to be put into oils.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.400
 I mean, they just weren't, right?

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:57.120
 Yeah, partly they are storing energy for the plants, but they are defensive substances.

01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:03.120
 The plant doesn't want its seeds to be consumed for food.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:08.280
 They want the seed to produce a new generation of plants.

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:17.520
 And they produce a variety of toxins special in the seeds that block digestion.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:21.760
 Cows are people eating the seeds.

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:28.200
 And they don't profit from them very much because there are things like the polyunsaturated

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:33.320
 fats that block our ability to digest proteins.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:40.440
 And so even though they contain proteins, they contain specific toxins that block animal

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:46.600
 proteolytic enzymes, not affecting the plant's own enzymes.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:53.920
 So it's obvious that they were evolved to damage animal digestion.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:00.240
 So that's a problem with cows and eating corn-fed beef and that kind of stuff.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.920
 It's just a problem.

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:11.360
 Yeah, if they eat grasses, the grass contains enough vitamin E that it is helping to destroy

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:21.560
 the 97% or 98% of the PUFA is destroyed in the cow's healthy rumen in the presence of

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:29.880
 vitamin E. But if there isn't enough vitamin E that's in grass, then the PUFA in the grains

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:31.880
 goes right through into the milk.

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.880
 Wow.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:39.600
 I mean, because a lot of the meats, they call it grain-fed and grass-finished, or the opposite,

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:46.080
 are grass-fed and grain-finished, so you got to be careful what they're doing, right?

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.080
 Yeah.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.080
 Wow.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.440
 So that's why our best shot is olive oil.

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.120
 Olive is a fruit, is it not?

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.800
 It's a fruit.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:15:01.440
 Yeah, it's a fruit oil and that means it's full of defensive things.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:09.160
 The plant wants the fruit to be eaten without, the seed is very hard and so it passes through

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:12.720
 the normal situation.

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:18.560
 You eat the fruit and discard the seed, so the seed is protected.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:27.880
 But the fruit is a benefit to the animal, so the plant benefits by having its seeds

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:31.800
 propagated by healthy animals.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:32.800
 This is from Mary.

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.920
 She said, "I know you can't get medical advice and it's tough to do this on a show, but would

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.760
 you mind just giving me some input?"

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:41.000
 She went to the doctor.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
 Everything was fine.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:48.080
 The doctor said, "My levels are great, but I have cold hands and feet and numb and I'm

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.520
 also having a hard time getting pregnant."

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:57.120
 She's got a TSH of 2.5, T3 of 3.5 and a T4 of 1.39.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.880
 Could Dr. Peat give me some advice of what I can do from here?

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.080
 Her doctor says everything's good.

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:15.200
 Yeah, it used to be recognized in the 1940s that thyroid hormone was the fertility hormone,

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:23.600
 the first basic fertility hormone both for men and women, supported by a progesterone,

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:29.240
 but the thyroid is the basic thing.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:36.080
 All of the signs of hypothyroidism, cold hands and feet are basic.

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:42.000
 Infertility is just one of the standard hypothyroid signs.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:52.120
 I've known people who hadn't been able to get pregnant for 10 or 15 years within two

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:59.000
 or three weeks after correcting their thyroid problem and eating well, they were pregnant.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.680
 So with these numbers, she could maybe experiment with a little bit of thyroid and see if she

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:04.680
 feels better?

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:08.680
 Do you think these numbers warrant her doing that?

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:18.520
 I've never seen a person with even as high as 2.0 TSH who didn't have some serious symptoms.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.040
 Oh, really?

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:31.280
 If you look like doctors used to, besides doing tests such as measuring their cholesterol,

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:40.880
 their carotene, their relaxation recovery rate of a reflex and their oxygen consumption,

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:51.440
 those were clear metabolic functional indicators of rate of metabolism, oxidative metabolism

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:54.360
 and therefore thyroid function.

01:17:54.360 --> 01:18:00.120
 They used to effectively diagnose by those indicators.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:10.440
 Now the official policy statements of the medical boards are direct instructions to

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:15.440
 ignore all of those relevant things, go only by TSH.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.160
 Just go by TSH and you still like the lower the better, way down there, right?

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:25.920
 Yeah, they accept it all the way up to 5 or so.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:37.080
 But when you look at a healthy population, people under the level of 0.4 on the TSH test

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:41.520
 were the healthiest, had no thyroid cancer essentially in that population.

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.520
 Interesting.

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:45.560
 So you could just do a TSH and just forget all the other stuff, you know what you're

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.440
 saying, if you wanted to do a blood test?

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:57.840
 The essential thing is to look at your temperature, your ability to metabolize calories, to eat

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:10.320
 2000 calories a day without gaining weight and to have all of the normal energy functions

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:18.040
 that go with thyroid and to ignore pretty much the blood test because you have to know

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:22.160
 a lot about the organism before you can interpret the blood test.

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:23.160
 Right.

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:32.760
 And so if I remember then, we want to be just anywhere above what 97, let's see, what is

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:37.640
 it, 97.7 to 98.6 in the morning?

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:48.600
 Yeah, around plus or minus a few tenths around 98 in the morning and up to 98.6 is good in

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.880
 the afternoon.

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:54.040
 And so if you're below 98 in the morning, a little thyroid might juice you up a little

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.040
 bit.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.040
 Yeah.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.960
 And you could start small too, right?

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:58.960
 Just start small?

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:07.480
 A fourth of a grain or 15 milligrams of armored thyroid for example is a good starting point

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:14.840
 and that amount used to be pretty close to the average consumed by people on the average

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:17.720
 diet throughout history.

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:25.480
 If you make a chicken soup or fish soup, there was always a thyroid disintegrating in the

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:33.800
 soup and so you were always getting some thyroid gland along with your meat.

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:34.800
 This is great.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.800
 This is an interesting question.

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.600
 I'm glad we saved it for last.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:42.000
 Patrick was talking about there are states, we had a show this morning and there are states

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.560
 wanting to pass a heartbeat kind of a thing so if there's a heartbeat then you can't do

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:49.560
 an abortion.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:53.760
 I think they're calling it a heartbeat and a lot of states are interested in doing this.

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:56.560
 I'm sure it will be taken to the Supreme Court and who cares.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:03.120
 But I'm curious what Dr. Peat thinks about this and when does he think soul enters the

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.120
 body?

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.120
 I love it.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.120
 That's a great question.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.120
 That's a good question.

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:12.240
 Doesn't the Bible talk about soul as the first breath or something?

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.920
 The first phew.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:14.920
 No?

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:20.000
 Yeah, that's one of the meanings of it is breath.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:31.560
 The newsletter I'm working on right now is looking at all of these cells right from the

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:35.720
 beginning as containing soul.

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:42.760
 So it would be everywhere right?

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:50.680
 Every bit would contain soul just as much as the whole so that you can't sacrifice any

01:21:50.680 --> 01:22:03.600
 part without being responsible for knowing that it's an autonomous awareness.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:10.240
 So it's just we're saturated, the whole body is saturated with who we are really and that

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:14.320
 makes sense because if we worry or something it's in our body isn't it?

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:17.120
 It's in there.

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:25.000
 So if we abort a fetus at a month, but the soul doesn't die so I mean you are killing

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.560
 something but you're not.

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:30.520
 You know what I mean?

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:45.120
 The personality is constantly developing and the things we eat have personalities and you

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:56.360
 have to realize that like the Jain religion their basic principle is harmlessness but

01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:09.120
 when you try to apply harmlessness you see that you're constantly damaging awarenesses.

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.320
 Even plants have sensations.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.040
 Of course, yes, of course.

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:19.400
 So everybody's killing something in a sense even though nothing really dies because right

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:24.200
 what has a beginning has an end but God really has never had a beginning has it?

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.200
 He?

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.200
 She?

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.200
 It?

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:32.640
 Well, you're always fun to talk to Dr. Peat.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:35.760
 Thanks so much for visiting with us this morning.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:40.360
 Dr. Ray Peat's, you can go to RayPeat's newsletter at gmail.com if you'd like to

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:41.800
 get on board with that.

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:43.440
 So that's the one you're working on now.

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:44.440
 That's the one you're working on.

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:45.440
 Yeah.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.240
 I'm looking forward to reading that guy.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.480
 You have a nice time up there in the Northwest.

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:58.240
 Are you people just still like silly and you know in the streets and whatever they do up

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.240
 there?

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.800
 People are starting to come out without their masks.

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:06.800
 Yeah, are they?

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:11.320
 You're not going to get the vaccination or the jab are you?

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:12.320
 Oh no.

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.280
 Okay, I didn't think you were.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:16.920
 I just wanted to because somebody emailed and wanted to know.

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:17.920
 Yes, Dr. Peat.

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:18.920
 Okay.

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:19.920
 All right, sir.

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:20.920
 Thanks a lot.

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:23.280
 I love you and thanks for being here.

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:24.840
 Okay, thank you.

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:25.840
 Thank you, sir.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:26.840
 Bye-bye.

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.680
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone, he's a good man.

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:32.720
 He's a good man.

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:36.480
 He's the real deal, man.

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:41.640
 Well what has a beginning has an end and you know it's always fun to think about.

01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.880
 We're going to have fun tomorrow.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:46.200
 We're going to talk to Tom Luongo.

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:55.160
 Tom is quite a curious sort when it comes to the monetary system, central banking, geopolitics,

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.800
 cryptos.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:59.160
 He's out of control and he's great.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.440
 He's going to be here tomorrow at noon.

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:03.640
 I don't think we'll probably want to have something until noon.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:07.200
 I can sleep in, have some orange juice.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:10.320
 Mel Kay is going to be here on Thursday.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:18.720
 Mel Kay, she's quite a fascinating little gal and she's in the genre.

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:27.520
 I don't know if you've ever seen any of the work of Charlie Ward, Simon Parks, Juan O'Savin,

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:32.000
 Robert David Steele, all these folks.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000
 Who's the other one?

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.840
 The Sausage Stone, the people that are out there.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:40.280
 They're doing a tour now.

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:48.800
 She's in this genre, kind of keeping her eyes on what's going on with the politics, geopolitics

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.280
 and even the pedophile thing.

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.840
 She's all over that.

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:59.320
 These people claim that there's a whole lot more going on, excuse me, deep down in the

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:05.280
 bowels of reality than you and I know about because nobody reports on it except these

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.280
 people.

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:07.280
 It'll be fun.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:12.400
 We're going to have her on Thursday.

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.680
 Matthew Aret will be here on Wednesday.

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:18.600
 Don DeMello, I think he's going to be great.

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:23.520
 I saw the title of the book and before I even looked into it I said, "Yep, we want to get

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.520
 him on."

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:29.520
 His book is about, "Don't try to fix it, just get awake."

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.760
 I know he's on it.

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:34.280
 I don't know if it's the exact title.

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:36.040
 Just get awake.

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:42.720
 I know he's on it with saying this because anybody that says this understands that we

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:46.120
 do not need to fix ourselves.

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:52.160
 Just get awake and go where we want to go.

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.240
 There's nothing to fix.

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.240
 It's just the mind.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:58.840
 If you get in there and try to fix the mind, well then you'll be there all day long and

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:03.960
 lifetimes and lifetimes trying to fix the mind, which is just software.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:07.240
 It's just trying to go into Windows 10 and start reprogramming it.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:08.240
 What's the point?

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:10.880
 Just ignore it.

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:11.880
 Don't try to fix anything.

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:16.640
 Just get awake and see who you are, why you are, where you are, and then go where you

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:17.640
 want to go.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:22.520
 That's what we talk about all the time here because this is the key to it, in my opinion.

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:27.680
 This idea of fixing something or going to therapy and all that, this has been going

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:29.240
 on forever and ever.

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.400
 I love these people.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.760
 I've been going to my therapist for about 25 years.

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:35.760
 Boy, she's great.

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:38.760
 You know what I'm saying.

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:42.080
 Yeah, no need to fix anything.

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:46.840
 Just do what you want and don't do things that you don't want.

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:49.720
 Do what you want.

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:50.720
 Do what makes you happy.

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:59.160
 Now, you can't get involved in people's space and stuff.

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:03.520
 As Richard Mayberry says, "Do all you have agreed to do and do not encroach on other

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.960
 people or their property."

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:10.800
 You can't do that, but other than that, you get to do what you want.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:14.960
 Any politician that tells you you can't, well, then you just need to join the Libertarian

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:22.680
 Party or just don't pay attention to them because they're all bonkers.

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:29.400
 No politician, no person has the authority to tell you to do anything.

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:32.800
 Zero, not nada.

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.800
 Private companies can.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:40.280
 So if you like going into Costco and getting some of their two-pound organic black cherry

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:44.740
 things, organic, which is great, and they want you to wear a mask, if you want to go

01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:51.000
 in there, well, you just got to do it because it's a private company and I don't recommend

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.520
 it because I don't do it anymore because I don't even want to put one of those suckers

01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:56.520
 on.

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:59.240
 But I did for a while just because I wanted their organic cherries.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:00.240
 But I don't care.

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:01.480
 I'll just pay more somewhere.

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:02.480
 I don't care.

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.240
 Okay, kids, I love you all very much.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:05.240
 Don't mind me.

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.840
 I just drone on here every now and then.

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:16.640
 I will see you tomorrow with Tom Luongo.

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:17.640
 Tom Luongo.

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.560
 Let me know if we can help with anything.

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:28.440
 My email is always, two or three times a day, I check my email, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:31.600
 Patrick at oneradionetwork.com.

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.800
 I love you all very much.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.800
 You're doing great.

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:39.240
 No matter what anybody says, may the blessings be.
