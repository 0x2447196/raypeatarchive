 >> Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.640
 It is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile threat

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.200
 with measures that are defensive.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.720
 That has turned to the very strengths in technology that spawned our great industrial base.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.880
 And that have given us the quality of life we enjoy today.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.760
 What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.040
 did not rest upon the threat of instant US retaliation to deter the Soviet attack?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.100
 We could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil over that of our allies.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.800
 I know this is a formidable technical task, one that may not be accomplished.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.760

 I would think can a kid or a normal person actually pull us off.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.520
 >> Well, what I did when I designed this was I understood that problem.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.400
 >> It seems the sweep of technology has no limits.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.600
 Except for Cisco this week, World's first robot bar tender was unveiled.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.920
 Robot can talk and take smoking orders and mix to 100 different drinks.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.960
 But on the first test run, Robot knocked the glass off the bar and

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.480
 on the floor and poured beer all over the counter.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.320
 And Robot's designer said there were still some bugs he worked out.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.240
 Those who gave us nuclear weapons to turn their great talents now to the cause of mankind and

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.860
 world peace, to give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.280
 Tonight, consistent with our obligations of the ADM treaty,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.080
 recognizing the need for closer consultation with our allies.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.600
 I'm taking an important first step.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.080

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.080
 Thank you guys so much for joining us.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.160
 Hit the like button, subscribe, Ray, how are you?

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.640
 How are you doing?

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.840
 And Georgie Dinkoff, how are you?

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.360
 >> Not bad, can you complain?

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.840
 There are mobs marauding the streets of DC, but other than that seems to be okay.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.200
 >> With that, we're going to take some criticism of this show as we're not talking about nutrition enough.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.440
 So I did want to, maybe if Ray will humor us, go back to basics and talk about the role

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.600
 of progesterone, carbon dioxide, the kind of the flow of electrons through the cell.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.560
 And so I probably can't talk about this enough because it's, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong right,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.440
 but it's really foundational to the bioenergetic perspective.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.240
 And so I don't know if we could just, I don't know, maybe paint a picture of what's

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.480
 happening when you're eating fats, proteins, and carbohydrate, how they combine with oxygen,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.640
 what role of thyroid having in that process going through the mitochondria,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.240
 producing carbon dioxide, and how that's reciprocating the use of oxygen.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.720
 And then what exactly is progesterone doing in that whole process?

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:24.800
 >> Okay, proteins, the basic substance of life, protein is acidic, and that means it's electron withdrawing

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:39.600
 and proton releasing. And this creates a preexisting, once you have protein substance,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:52.360
 a deficit of electrons. So being acidic, it's already inclined towards oxidation.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:03.080
 It's a high content of oxygen atoms on the polymers that creates the acidity of the proteins.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:21.360
 And that, the organization of Jeremy England at MIT is working out the very basic physical

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:34.680
 principles of simply the crudest sense of the flow of energy shining light on simple molecules

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:48.160
 and showing that it creates order. And if you once come to the existing proteins,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:58.120
 if you shine light on it or in any way have an energy disequilibrium, you get a flow of

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:15.560
 energy through that gob of polymerized atoms. And the flow of energy itself, the way Jeremy

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:25.680
 England shows with simple atoms, it, once you have a polymer solution, a co-assurate,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:42.880
 for example, or just an emulsion, the difference, two points that have different electron affinity,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:51.960
 it's going to align these proteins according to where the electrons are flowing. So if you

00:07:51.960 --> 00:08:02.360
 have an oxidant on one end and an exciting electron source on the other, the potential

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:15.500
 electron donor, there's going to be a flow of energy that will create order in the polymer.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:25.720
 My experiment that convinced me that it's a very simple process was to stick two electrodes

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:37.440
 through an egg shell and measure the current flow and resistance as the voltage rises

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:47.040
 and then the current flow and resistance as the voltage falls, just an oscillating change

00:08:47.040 --> 00:09:00.700
 in voltage, you get a very strong hysteresis loop on the falling voltage, the flow of

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:10.560
 electrons is out of proportion. They flow very easily with little resistance because

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:24.840
 as the voltage increased, the proteins created a conductive channel. So what walking makes

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:33.480
 the road basically, whenever you have energy flowing, you make the pass easier for the

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:41.800
 next flow of energy. And so it's like it increases its appetite and capacity to use

00:09:41.800 --> 00:10:00.080
 energy. During the process of development and evolution, you get all sorts of side channels

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:12.240
 of energy being drained off in creating different substances according to the voltage difference

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:23.440
 and availability of the atoms and molecules that have arranged themselves aligned in an

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:37.760
 ordered way. So the more complex it gets, the faster it gets more complex yet. And Vernadsky,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:48.520
 early in the 20th century, worked out the implications of this, that the sun as the source

00:10:48.520 --> 00:11:04.160
 of energy flowing through substance created order and continuing the flow spontaneously

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:15.640
 leads to a higher and higher metabolic rate, the hysteresis curve, the bigger it gets the

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:26.160
 more electrons that can conduct for a second. And as a consequence of that faster and faster

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:36.200
 flow of electrons, you get a more complex system with a bigger brain, for example, which creates

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:47.120
 and maintains that higher metabolic rate. So physically, Vernadsky a hundred years ago

00:11:47.120 --> 00:12:01.440
 had described it in detail with all its implications. And almost at the same time, there were two

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:15.240
 or three people working out the medical, biological, and developed implications of oxygen in a

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:28.960
 very practical way. Frederick Cook or Coke in the U.S. out of Warburg and the Albert St.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:44.120
 Georgie, we're all seeing the creation of the aspiring organisms as developing and progressing

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:56.080
 through the use of oxygen. And they saw that when you interfere with this flow of electrons

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:06.520
 by doing something that blocks the ability to use oxygen, you revert to basically a slime

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:23.880
 metabolism, a very primitive ancient, underorganized way of using energy. And all three of these

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:37.880
 at Warburg, Coke, and St. Georgie saw cancer as using a primitive pre-oxidative metabolism.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:49.640
 And the more or less overlapping with their studies, there were a couple of people working

00:13:49.640 --> 00:14:02.400
 on the implications of carbon dioxide as the product of oxidative metabolism and the extraction

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:20.920
 of electrons from fuel. And the carbon dioxide, if you think of it in mechanistic terms,

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:34.400
 the tendency is to not notice that carbon dioxide in itself is acidic. The common theory of

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:47.800
 acid that's still built out as the basic thing in science textbooks and courses is the proton

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:59.680
 donor theory of acidity. But all of these physical ordering processes caused by oxygen

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:09.320
 are really the electron retraction theory of acidity. And carbon dioxide doesn't have

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:18.280
 any protons, so if you think of proton release as the essence of an acid, you can't think

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:30.800
 of CO2 in itself as an acid, but it's called the Lewis acid. And if it having two oxygens

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:41.440
 on one carbon, it's a very powerful electron binder. So if the instant it sits down on

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:51.840
 a protein, the protein shifts its electrons to be close to the sender of the carbon dioxide

00:15:51.840 --> 00:16:04.240
 molecule. So it increases the acidity. You have a pre-existing protein with acidity.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:14.640
 And when you oxidize something and produce carbon dioxide, that increases, intensifies

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:28.640
 the acidity. And so that's part of the sculpting effect of respiration. It intensifies whatever

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:37.820
 process was creating it in the first place. The more you breathe, the more able you are

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.800
 to breathe in effect.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:49.560
 I have a question in regards to the solar energy. I mean, given that most of the molecules

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:56.720
 that compose us and that are flying around in the universe, they're charged molecules.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.200
 And we have this constant flow of energy, at least in the solar system, in the form of

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.920
 the photons from the sun. Doesn't that automatically imply that randomness, more or less, would

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.640
 be impossible in such an environment because there will always be an orientation, which

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.680
 means some kind of an order which the sun will create?

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:26.920
 Yeah, just light streaming through gas. It's creating order. When you look at ionizing

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:36.240
 radiation, they emphasize the disorder that it creates. But when a cosmic ray particle

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:44.660
 goes through something, you can see the trail of changes it has introduced. But just the

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:54.820
 flow of light is, to the extent that it's interacting with a matter at all, it's giving

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.580
 it an order and direction.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:04.120
 I was speaking to a physics professor about randomness recently, and he kind of failed

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:09.920
 to give me a definition of what would be a physical test for randomness. I said, "All

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.660
 of your tests are statistical." I mean, you get a stream of numbers, and if it satisfies

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:20.060
 a certain number of statistical tests, you call it random. But in nature, I don't have

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:25.380
 a single example, I don't know of a single example, that true randomness has been found.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:31.980
 It always seems to be subjective, right, based on the large of the data set, right?

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:41.640
 It's a huge religious philosophical assumption. It's sort of like original sin, you believe

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:50.240
 it, and then you follow all the consequences of believing it.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:19:00.840
 About 50 years ago, I wrote an article the assumption of randomness and all of the consequences

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:06.340
 that have come from that very arbitrary assumption.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.140
 You mentioned Albert St. Georgie, and I remember you saying this a long time ago, and it was

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:15.420
 something that I think was fundamental for me to mildly understand where you're coming

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:20.060
 from. In his book, The Living State, he said, "The ability of unlimited proliferation is

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:25.480
 an attribute of life. In the simplest living forms, growth is limited only by environmental

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.740
 factors. In multicellular organisms, this potential has to be suppressed in the interest

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:34.600
 of the organism as a whole. It must be restored when proliferation is needed and again arrested

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:40.920
 when no longer needed. When the suppression mechanism is out of order, and the cell loses

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:50.520
 its ability to stop proliferation, senseless growth can't result, so that is a flood warning.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:57.320
 That's basically exactly what you're saying in terms of, in another article you talked

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:05.140
 about sugar and oxygen being these brackets for our energy production. When these things

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:14.960
 are blocked, we revert to this unlimited proliferation blob like state. That kind of the M of hypothyroidism,

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:24.960
 the person becoming definitionless and looking more like a blob.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:40.600
 Phyroid is the essence of oxidation for living cells. Have you ever seen the experiment with

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:52.880
 a tadpole, with a thyroid blocker, or with an excess of thyroid hormones? If you block

00:20:52.880 --> 00:21:04.960
 the thyroid function, you get a giant infantile tadpole. If you give it an overdose of when

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:13.040
 the tadpole is maybe three quarters of an inch long, an overdose of thyroid, you get a miniature

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:21.240
 frog about the size of a spider. The foods being reduced into electrons and then going

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:27.920
 through the cell and the inventory of oxygen being dictated as I understand it primarily

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:37.460
 by carbon dioxide. So what can go wrong in this process? You've talked about some pivotal

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:46.880
 what I call landmarks and cellular metabolism such as phosphofructokinase 1. You've talked

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:52.960
 a lot about pyruvate dehydrogenase and of course cytochrome C oxidase. What are some

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.600
 big picture of things that are important for understanding the production of energy and

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:06.800
 then how that process starts to degrade as we age?

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:11.720
 Maybe starting with the phosphofructokinase 1. Is it that's blocked by things like free

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:17.280
 fatty acids and stress and such?

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:32.480
 Just the choice between fat and carbohydrate, when you oxidize carbohydrate, you get extra

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:43.120
 carbon dioxide as a byproduct. So it's like insurance that you're going to reinforce

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:56.000
 the oxidizing process. But oxidizing fat, even if it's a safe saturated fat, you don't get

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:07.120
 such a return of carbon dioxide and so that increases the risk of falling over into the

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:26.240
 lactate, glycolytic slime metabolism. When you're starving or diabetic or unachitogenic diet,

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:41.880
 you're lowering the oxidative state of the cell. By making you less stable, it's opening

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:51.240
 up the opportunities for all of the processes of aging, creating collagen, for example,

00:23:51.240 --> 00:24:05.360
 free radical activities such as nitric oxide, which can degrade your DNA. When you're perfectly

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:12.760
 at rest and in good health, it's okay to sit there letting your muscles have a pure

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:20.800
 fat diet when everything is very common and you aren't likely to blow out too much carbon

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:34.000
 dioxide. But as soon as you have any stress activity that makes you at risk of taking

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:42.600
 in too much oxygen relative to carbon dioxide, then that starts increasing your nitric oxide

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:54.800
 production, collagen deposition, for example, two ends of the aging carcinogenic process.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:00.560
 And a shout out to Jay Feldman for making me more aware of this, but he says in one of

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.120
 his articles, and that's somebody that follows your work, right, but he says in one of his

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.920
 articles, glucose oxidation produces about 25% more NEDH and half as much FADH2 as fat

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:16.280
 oxidation. And I hope I don't screw this up. But well, he says, FADH2 donates electrons

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:22.440
 at complex two and reduces the amount of uberquinone available to accept electrons at complex

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:32.560
 one. And this is the main kind of place where it's being shifted to the reduced NADH away

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:41.400
 from the NADH plus in the fat oxidation is this backup of electrons in these complexes.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:52.920
 It might be most often the biggest factor, but I think everything tends to work together.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:26:05.880
 So many places, essentially, everywhere process is working. It tends to get biased when you're

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:16.160
 not over producing carbon dioxide, wasteful energy in the sense of pouring out the carbon

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:30.120
 dioxide and producing heat as your only product. That's insurance and it's acting on many,

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:40.520
 probably hundreds of identifiable different enzymes and regulators and structural proteins

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:48.700
 in the mitochondrion cytoplasm. And he also mentioned like this is complex one primarily

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:56.000
 where the or one of the major sources, the superoxide and then that hopefully I'm not

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.440
 screwing this up. But the superoxide is combined with something to produce the nitric oxide.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:07.220
 And so again, the fat metabolism is inherently increasing like the function or the production

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:19.260
 of nitric oxide, is that right? Unless you get the whole stream going, pulling

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:32.060
 the electrons out at a maximum rate at the oxygen end, then that in effect is attracting

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:44.080
 electrons that would make superoxide and other random damaging electrons. The faster you

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:59.040
 run the apparatus, it creates, again, an electron with drawing effect from the surrounding cells,

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:15.100
 just as a neighboring atom to atom influence, not a chemical reaction but an inclination

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:22.720
 towards a more carbon dioxide-like condition of the structure.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:29.860
 So I have a question. So I guess something like metaling blue, which is technically an

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:36.380
 oxidizing agent, it's also an antioxidant because it enables the flow of these electrons

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.800
 throughout the entire chain the way they're supposed to be. It prevents the formation

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.160
 of these reactive oxygen species, so it's an actual functional antioxidant while also

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:56.320
 being an oxidizing agent. And I think all of these so-called antioxidants, like ascorbic

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:03.680
 acid, when it's really protecting you and working the way it should, it's a powerful

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:13.120
 oxidant dehydroiscorbate is the predominant form in a healthy working cell, and that shifts

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:24.640
 in the direction of ascorbic acid in cancer and stress cells. So the whole idea of antioxidant

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:40.000
 has been skewed heavily by denying the role of carbon dioxide and oxidation as a protective

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:48.200
 effect, the stronger the oxidation in the normal route, the more wasteful and inefficient

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:59.360
 your energy is. Energy production is the safer you are. And if you put in the reduced

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:11.120
 form of these so-called antioxidants, those will create destructive oxidation. So overloading

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:21.120
 on vitamin C, for example, in the reduced form will interact randomly with iron, for

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:35.260
 example, along the way and create toxic, excited, oxidative fragments. So aren't reductants

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:41.000
 like estrogen and lactate also these types of bad antioxidants, the destroyer system?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:52.160
 Lactate, I think, should stand out as a polar opposite of carbon dioxide. I think a basic

00:30:52.160 --> 00:31:02.760
 medical test should be the level of lactate in your blood and of total carbon dioxide

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:14.080
 in CO2. The higher lactate gets, the closer you are to being dead.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:21.240
 So basically the lactate is in a sense, just the mere buildup of lactate is enough to derange

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:31.360
 the oxidative metabolism. Yeah, you can inject lactated ringers, for example, and cause toxic

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:38.640
 damage by shifting your system away from the oxidative state.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.880
 Do you know why some of the studies, there used to be older studies that showed that

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:48.880
 ringers lactate can cause seizures in susceptible people, but those studies seem to have stopped

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:55.520
 about 20 years ago. I haven't seen any new ones because they like some kind of a campaign

00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:01.640
 but a pharmaceutical industry to, again, hide the truth.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:08.000
 Just in the last 20 years or so, there's been a kind of a deification of lactic acid

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:22.920
 and lactate. I don't know if that is powering it, but it's essentially an irrational decriminalization

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.400
 of lactate.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:31.820
 I think a few years ago, we talked about the NAD, the NADH ratio, which reflects the reduction

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:39.160
 oxidation balance. Maybe I was reading a paper by Veach, and he stated that he thought the

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:47.600
 NADH should be higher relative to the NAD. Is that a more common belief in academia that

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:55.000
 the reduction should be higher than. So you're expressing media.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:11.280
 It's like 99 to 100 of very confused attitude towards NADH, where it should be 700 to each

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:21.960
 NADH. The oxidized form should be extreme when you're under stress. It gets down more

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.360
 like two or 300 to one.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:28.960
 Since NAD is so popular now with those NAD drips and stuff, are people trying to pretend

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:34.200
 like they never held that those beliefs before?

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:45.720
 Yeah, a lot of them don't know about it, but they think they're raising their NADH. Lots

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:54.360
 of places are selling to reduced form of NADH as being better because it's reduced. The

00:33:54.360 --> 00:34:05.120
 same with ubiquinone and ubiquinol, they say the quinol is better because it's reduced.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:10.160
 And Georgie told me this and I've found it in a few papers, but the higher NADH is one

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:15.480
 of the signals to turn off the pyruvate dehydrogenase. And that's like some like ketosis advocates

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:20.600
 that write papers like one of his names like Jeff Volek. He talks about how that's a consequence

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:28.760
 of ketosis. What's the problem if pyruvate dehydrogenase is turned off? Does it matter?

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:41.160
 Oh, yeah, that makes the whole cell shift in that direction. Once it starts with the excess

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:53.160
 reducing environment, that tends to reinforce it and make it get worse and worse.

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:57.080
 Well, if you turn off pyruvate dehydrogenase, as we just mentioned, you're starting to

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:02.440
 immediately build up lactate because pyruvate will be used as the emergency oxidant. So

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.560
 you're going to start building up lactate and we just said that I don't know if there's

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:10.520
 any circumstance where you would want elevated lactate just because it's so deranging to

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:20.920
 bring themselves. Yeah, and to keep the production of lactate going, you need something to get rid

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:34.520
 of the build-up, the higher and higher levels of NADH. And the intrinsic alternative to oxygen

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:48.280
 is the synthesis of fats. And so when the cell gets convinced that it isn't going to get enough

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:58.200
 oxygen, then it starts synthesizing fatty acids like crazy. Estrogen and other stressors

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:07.320
 will turn on this enzyme system to consume excess NADH

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:19.160
 in the absence of oxygen. And so it runs glycolysis, lactic acid production, intrinsically

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:30.440
 changing the cell over to consuming energy at a high rate but in a destructive

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:39.080
 primitiveizing direction. So sometimes they'll say, well, you know, fatty acids bypass glycolysis

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:45.480
 and they form through the activation of acetyl CoA. And so that's good to skip glycolysis and go

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:51.080
 directly to the mitochondria. What's the faulty thinking with that argument?

00:36:51.080 --> 00:37:00.760
 That's going to deprive you of carbon dioxide production relative to what you could have with

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:10.040
 oxidizing glucose. And then the oxygen supply is the kind of the credit like because we can

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:15.720
 consume our tissues to produce glucose. The real bottleneck of everything is the oxygen supply and

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:21.000
 things like lipid proxidation and the lack of carbon dioxide. Those are interfering and estrogen

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:30.120
 are interfering with our oxygen supply. I also read a paper recently showing that the fatty acid

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:39.560
 cintase enzyme and the beta oxidation structure are also often form complexes with the estrogen

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:46.840
 receptor. So anytime you're over oxidizing fat or synthesizing fats, you're also directly activating

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:52.440
 the estrogen system, especially the estrogen receptor alpha, which seems to be the, like,

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:58.440
 not the bad one, but the one that's actually driving all of the pro cancerous effects of estrogen.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:11.960
 Yeah. And just the stress state, if you overheat a cell, that will activate the fatty acid cintase.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:17.800
 Maybe a while ago, maybe you've said it more recently, I'm not sure, but you talked about like

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:23.240
 using progesterone as your stress hormone. So maybe an ideal environment, this reduction

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:35.240
 oxidation process is happening normally. And like when does progesterone enter the picture? I don't

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:39.400
 know, can you unpack that using it as your stress hormone, something you said a while ago?

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.400
 Antistress.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:54.200
 Cholesterol is on the very primitive level. Cholesterol is the steroid stabilizing

00:38:54.200 --> 00:39:01.720
 pro-oxidative equivalent of progesterone. And with higher

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:14.680
 organization, the progesterone refines the functions of cholesterol on stabilizing and

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:26.120
 directing the cell in that ability to go down the organization building pathways.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:31.560
 But I guess in an ideal world, if a person is producing lots of progesterone, is that

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.800
 sounds kind of stupid, but like is that used up before you activate the kind of the classical

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.600
 hypothalamus pituitary and adrenal systems?

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:59.240
 The brain has its intrinsic machinery. The ovaries are just there to reinforce the organism

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:13.560
 so it's able to safely go through a pregnancy and guarantee the well-being, despite the stress

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:22.040
 the mother is going through, the ovaries, and then the placenta are very powerful

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:33.000
 progesterone synthesizers. But for everyone who isn't pregnant, the brain is our most intense

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:40.680
 progesterone, a factory progesterone, and it's a product.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:47.960
 I have a question related to progesterone and pregnenolone. In some of the older studies,

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:54.440
 especially the ones that Celia did, he showed that giving people pregnenolone decreases their

00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:01.000
 excretion of 17 kerosteroids, which Celia thought means that pregnenolone is giving the adrenals a

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.240
 break, but without the negative effects of, let's say, taking cortisol directly. Would you say

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.280
 that pregnenolone probably fills in for some of the roles of cortisol?

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:22.920
 Yeah, an experiment in rats around 1950 gave, with a stomach tube, they gave them, I think,

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:31.800
 was a 10 gram dose of pregnenolone filling their stomachs with it, and they had measured their

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:44.440
 cortisol before the experiment, and a certain proportion of them had above normal level of cortisol,

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:55.720
 showing that they were having to respond that way to stress of some sort. But all of them

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:05.640
 having received this gigantic dose of pregnenolone, all of them had normal levels of cortisol after

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:20.600
 that, so it bypassed the need to produce cortisol. And people tend to think of a mass action effect

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:30.600
 that if you eat a lot of pregnenolone, won't you get increased levels of the product, but it's

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:39.960
 exactly the opposite. It works like cholesterol and progesterone to stabilize the organism,

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:47.640
 so you don't need to resort to the harmful things like albastro and cortisol.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.680
 I remember what I was thinking of. You mentioned another rat study, and I have it in my notes,

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:59.320
 but maybe they removed the adrenals, but as long as the rat had super physiological levels of salt

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:03.480
 or progesterone, it could survive, but then the progesterone would take it.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:17.560
 He noticed a cell you noticed at first when he had the adrenal glands removed, and all of them

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:25.320
 died very quickly as soon as they were under stress, but the females that were pregnant

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:36.360
 survived as long as they were pregnant, and then died. And so he decided to try non-pregnant

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:43.720
 animals removing their steroids and supplementing progesterone, and they lived out particularly

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:51.560
 normal, healthy lifespans without adrenal glands if they were given progesterone. It

00:43:51.560 --> 00:44:00.440
 makes up not only for cortisol, but for albastro and all of the other functions of the adrenals.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:11.320
 And the progesterone is acting on the oxidation reduction balance, but you said on a lower level,

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.760
 it's ordering the water, and that's how it's so protective in the cell?

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:30.120
 If you think of estrogen as doing everything that tends to excite the cell and move it to a lower

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:42.120
 non-oxidizing energy system, progesterone knocks out those effects of estrogen and gets the cell

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:55.720
 back on the oxidizing pathway. The bioflavonoids that people have sometimes talked about them

00:44:55.720 --> 00:45:06.280
 as antioxidants or other functions, but the most important ones are working in the same direction

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:18.440
 as carbon dioxide and progesterone, shifting the balance slightly favoring NAD rather than NADH.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:25.320
 I have a question on that about progesterone. Looking at the structure of the molecule

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:31.400
 and comparing it to estrogen, I mean, basically progesterone is just four rings with two carbonyl

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:36.360
 groups. Doesn't that technically make it a quinone similar to a moldine or like metaline blue?

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:50.600
 Well, that carbonyl group especially, if it resonates with another double bond,

00:45:52.200 --> 00:46:02.280
 that is a very strong electron retractor. An analogous to the carbon dioxide effect where you

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:13.960
 have two double bonded oxygens on the carbon. The activated carbonyl group has that function,

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:22.040
 so when you see it in a molecule, it means that it's likely to be protected in some way.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:29.480
 Jumping back a little bit, Ray, do you remember the arguments of the people saying that the NADH

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:35.320
 should be higher? What was their thought process? Basically, no thought.

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:49.240
 Just referring to the idea of antioxidants, you need to restore when

00:46:49.240 --> 00:47:01.240
 vitamin E, for example, gets oxidized, vitamin C will replenish the electron and then NADH

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:15.240
 replenishes, vitamin C's, the electron and so on. They extrapolate much too far from the idea of

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:27.080
 protective antioxidants and forget that what we want is pro-oxidation to protect against those

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:37.320
 destructive oxidations. We talked about this a while ago, but if you're saying the poofa

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:43.240
 are essentially saying that some level of lipid peroxidation is desirable when

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:51.560
 almost in general, nobody is saying that lipid peroxidation is some good process. It's exclusively

00:47:51.560 --> 00:48:05.800
 harmful. Is that right? The good oxidation is very focused and antioxidant in the sense of

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:13.000
 preventing things like chain reactions of polyunsaturated fat breakdown.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:20.600
 I think the indication of the badness of lipid peroxidation, one of the major byproducts is

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:25.960
 something called malone dialdehyde, and I think that's one of the few endogenous metabolites

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:32.120
 that are known to be mutagenic, or at least strongly suspected to be so, but nothing that

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:36.600
 glucose oxidation produces ever generates any such dangerous metabolites.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:49.080
 Right. I think there are probably a lot more of the breakdown

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:59.240
 polyunsaturated fats, but that has been malone dialdehyde. It has been very heavily studied,

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:13.640
 three carbon and six and nine carbon units, I think are DNA damaging too.

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:20.440
 Speaking of something you probably can't say enough, but isn't it the glycerol from the free

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:28.440
 fatty acids that is majorly forming the methyl glyoxal, and that is essential for the advanced

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:39.160
 glycation end products that are blamed on glucose? Yeah. Especially in the presence of polyunsaturated

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:50.280
 fats, the methyl glyoxal starts to break down, and then those fragments of linoleic or

00:49:50.280 --> 00:50:02.120
 arachidonic acid, or the higher DHA and EPA, those breakdown fragments amplify the so-called

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:16.200
 glycation. It's predominantly a pufa deterioration that counts as glycation.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:24.280
 If the person was like hypoxic and the sugar was being converted into lactic acid,

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:32.120
 that could contribute to the methyl glyoxal too, but not nearly as much as the glycerol.

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:44.040
 I think by shifting the redox in that direction, I think it probably intensifies that

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:59.880
 methyl glyoxal metabolism. Once you get that shift towards lactate, you're shifting against

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:13.560
 carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide is a direct blocker of the protein glycation or glycosylation.

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:33.640
 In blood physiology, they talk about the formation of carbonyl hemoglobin. The carbonyl reaction

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:43.000
 is recognized perfectly well. Higher concentration, the carbon dioxide forms a compound with the

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:50.920
 amino group of the hemoglobin protein, and that pulls electrons through the protein,

00:51:50.920 --> 00:52:00.920
 increasing the acidity, and affecting the affinity of the hemoglobin for

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:09.720
 oxygen, depending on how much carbon dioxide is competing for the electrons in the system.

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:20.840
 What they don't talk about is that wherever in the body you have similar amino groups on proteins,

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:32.680
 carbon dioxide, when it reaches those levels, is going to form carbonyl compounds of whatever

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:45.960
 protein you're talking about, which could be insulin itself, or the various receptors on

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:55.800
 cells all the way through a cell, wherever a so-called receptor has an exposed amino group.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:05.640
 Carbon dioxide is going to form a carbonyl compound, shifting electrons, so the process

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:15.800
 that happens, everyone knows it happens in hemoglobin, but they neglect the physical chemistry that

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:25.320
 says it has to happen wherever you have carbon dioxide and the amino groups. That's part of

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:39.160
 how the whole system shifts as a unit. You can't talk about individual receptors independently

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:47.400
 without looking at how they participate in this global shift towards electron withdrawal.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:55.560
 Two questions related to steroids. The first one is about cholesterol and

00:53:55.560 --> 00:54:00.520
 pregnenolone. As you mentioned, cholesterol is the fundamental primitive, almost ancient

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:07.480
 protective mechanism, a structural protector of the cell, but if there is an environment in the

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:12.520
 body where there's a lot of production of reactive oxygen species and metabolism is not working well,

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:17.960
 cholesterol can get oxidized into these metabolites that are known to have a role in

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:25.080
 cardiovascular disease. It can also get a terrified cholesterol, as you mentioned in several of

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:29.880
 your newsletters, is one of the whole marks of aging. But if you look at pregnenolone,

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:35.880
 the molecule is structurally almost the same as cholesterol, minus this fatty acid sidechain

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:41.720
 that cholesterol has. Do you think pregnenolone can fill in for a lot of the structural protection

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:48.760
 functions that cholesterol has, but without the dangers? Right in the mitotic apparatus,

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:59.800
 pregnenolone has a very central primitive essential function for cell division and stabilization

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:06.920
 at preventing abnormal cell division and chromosomal damage and so on.

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:18.280
 But the process that makes cholesterol form these esters, it's the polyunsaturated fatty acid

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:28.040
 ester of cholesterol, which gets stuck in the cells and gets stuck there because of an inflammatory

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:40.680
 process, started by this lactic acid shift towards everything pro-inflammatory. So I see lactic acid

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:52.200
 as starting the inflammatory process leading to the binding of pufa to cholesterol and blocking

00:55:52.200 --> 00:56:02.040
 the cell's ability to break it down, oxidize the fatty acid and let cholesterol do its protective

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:09.880
 work. So do you think the esterification of cholesterol with these pufas is essentially

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:15.000
 kind of like an emergency protective mechanism to decrease the availability of pufa for producing

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:25.160
 the inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and lukotryans? If you don't have the pufa,

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:35.320
 you have an on and off of the saturated fatty acid ester, so it doesn't accumulate

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:46.520
 year after year. It conservates a momentary purpose, but when it's polyunsaturated,

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:55.560
 the level builds up year after year and your blood vessels or brain or other tissues.

00:56:55.560 --> 00:57:01.240
 Okay, and my second question is related to the overlap between

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:06.600
 pregnant alone and progesterone as far as the stress system is concerned. I think you mentioned

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:13.160
 in several of your articles and newsletters that pregnant alone is known to lower the release of

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:20.280
 ACTH by the pituitary sort of form of like a negative feedback similar to cortisol in this

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:26.440
 way stop the stress system, but progesterone by being a cortisol antagonist at the receptor level,

00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:32.600
 I've seen several studies where it shows cortisol can actually raise ACTH because the body interprets

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:37.720
 the presence of progesterone, I'm sorry not cortisol, progesterone, interprets the progesterone being

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:42.120
 an antagonist of the cortisol receptor, it's almost like a cortisol deficiency, so you will

00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:48.680
 raise ACTH. Do you think there is a potential for this elevation of ACTH being potentially

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:55.640
 dangerous if the supply of progesterone is removed? No, I think that progesterone is going to take

00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:04.840
 care of that experimental setup. I think it was a closed system where you couldn't

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:14.200
 see progesterone correcting both ends of the process because physiologically progesterone will

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:24.200
 lower cortisol production directly acting on the adrenal, but also lowering the pituitary

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:34.760
 activity and the brain activity that activates the pituitary it's working on at least three levels

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:43.480
 anti-stress and if you isolate the system then you can see a conflict between

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:54.040
 negative feedback of cortisol and progesterone interfering with that but I think that's only a

00:58:54.040 --> 00:59:02.120
 poorly arranged experiment. So to what degree do you think pregnant one in progesterone overlap

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:07.080
 in terms of their anti-stress effects of shutting off the excess adrenal activity?

00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:15.960
 I would guess that in a similar quantity progesterone is going to be

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:29.000
 more active per mole but since it's more common to take a bigger dose of pregnantone

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:37.720
 you don't get the powerful anesthetic effect from a very big dose of pregnant one for example.

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:48.360
 If you had similar amounts I think progesterone would be the more powerful and by stressor.

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:52.680
 But the mechanisms of action are largely the same, largely of 11.

00:59:52.680 --> 01:00:01.480
 Yeah okay. To wrap up this thought Ray could you like why is this important are we we're living

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:07.640
 in this kind of reducing world and we're trying to stay oxidized and that's largely the problem

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:14.040
 everything in our environment is pushing us towards that reduced state and that's why

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.440
 this is kind of an uphill battle is that right?

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:32.600
 Yeah even the excess high pressure oxygen of the atmosphere at sea level by displacing

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:45.720
 too much carbon dioxide in our lungs even that higher than desirable level of oxygen ends up

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:51.240
 putting us into the reducing state by displacing too much carbon dioxide.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:01:00.360
 What about the iodized air at sea level doesn't that have a little bit of a protective effect

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:11.000
 by neutralizing serotonin? Oh yeah yeah if you keep your metabolism in an anti-inflammatory

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:25.880
 pro-thyroid high metabolic rate glucose oxidizing condition then it will keep its serotonin and

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:35.800
 nitric oxide and those things under control so you can tolerate a high level of stress if your

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:45.000
 energy flow is strong enough. Okay one last question for me in regards to sugars there is glucose

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.200
 then there's fructose and then there's trecholose the fungus sugar which you wrote about in one of

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:57.000
 the newsletters of the three would you say that trecholose is potentially the safest in terms of

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.440
 not generating as much lactate even in compromised individuals?

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:12.760
 I haven't seen enough experiments with mammalian cells for example to know how it works for

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:24.360
 maintaining the energy system. Okay thank you. One of the reasons for preferring fructose

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:36.840
 or sucrose over starch and pure glucose is that ketone function has that

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:48.520
 biasing effect putting the cell into a more oxidizing state and what one of the effects is to

01:02:48.520 --> 01:03:07.240
 for example the fatty liver effect of overdosing on fats or starvation or stress alcohol puts you

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:17.240
 in a highly reducing state that tends to produce fatty liver and they do experiments

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:31.560
 intending to incriminate fructose as producing a fatty liver the same way ethanol or the stresses

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:42.520
 do but in fact when you have stay within physiological limits fructose is an exact

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:52.520
 antidote to that fatty liver producing effect of ethanol. Ethanol puts the cell in in a reducing

01:03:53.720 --> 01:04:03.720
 condition fructose at the right level favors the oxidizing condition and will for example

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:13.960
 protect you against the toxic effects even a hangover fructose will get yourselves quickly

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:24.360
 back into the oxidizing anti stress condition. Okay just one last question since sucrose

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:30.440
 and trecolos are of the kind of so-called non reducing sugars wouldn't just that be like a

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:36.040
 reason enough to like use them over as a fuel like to prefer to be a fuel to any of the other

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.680
 macronutrients given that they're actually they will not put you in a reduced state just by their

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:53.880
 chemical structure. Yeah that's my reason for preferring fructose and sucrose but I haven't seen

01:04:53.880 --> 01:05:01.560
 experiments with treolos in in mammal cells. There is a mention trecolos because there's this

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:08.760
 really hearty animal the water bear that can survive like ridiculously lethal doses of radiation

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:15.640
 be exposed you know be sending to outer space and sit there and then come back and be

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:20.680
 relatively unharmed and it looks like most of its most of the sugars that it uses inside its

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:28.520
 cells is trecolos. Yeah I think there it's having the same effect that enositol does

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:39.240
 I think that's a structural effect on the water which I just haven't seen how it works

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:48.360
 how mammalian cells can handle that but on simpler organisms

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:57.800
 the trecolos and what are they say just now the

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:07.080
 enositol? Enositol. Yeah yeah enositol which isn't a sugar but it

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:17.320
 has a spatial arrangement of the hydroxyl groups that make it more effective than sugar

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:24.920
 as a stabilizer of proteins. Have you seen the human studies with enositol that

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:30.760
 it cures even treatment resistant depression that nothing else can really touch in terms of

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:46.040
 fun drugs? I think it will eventually come into use as just a situational defense like

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:55.880
 Pregnantel and/or Progesterone as an all-purpose protective effect. Studies have been done on

01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:05.640
 various cells with X irradiation showing that it is a powerful anti-radiation damage factor.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:10.600
 So it's structurally acts similar to sugar basically even though it's technically not?

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:23.000
 Yeah it doesn't get burned up so fast as fructose or glucose so it can have a longer lasting

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:31.560
 stabilizing effect. So switching gears a little bit I've never received so much email

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:38.040
 about something then our last talk about Stalin and so I really want to dig deep into

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:43.080
 this as possible. Much to the dismay I'm sure a lot of people listening to this. Okay so Ray have

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:51.080
 you heard of I'm sure you have but CIA project aerodynamic? No I never heard of it. So I just

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:57.240
 kind of accidentally stumbled upon it but apparently it was a CIA scheme to create anti-Russian propaganda

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:02.680
 and then somebody like frequently that's brought up in like kind of conservative circles is

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:10.840
 Yuri Besmanoff who is supposed to be like an XKGB defector and he talks about how the like

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:18.600
 the Soviets were infiltrating America to impose communism and basically it turns out he probably

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:25.640
 worked for the CIA. Anyways so if we could like open this up as much as possible and the thing that

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:31.720
 I thought was interesting as I was reading an article by Andrew Gavin Marshall it's called

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:39.320
 Origins of American Empire on Global Research and he again framed things in an interesting way and

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:44.360
 I'd be interested to bounce it off you and see if it was even right but he talked about kind of the

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:49.880
 opposition of Stalin to the Rothschilds and also the Rockefellers who wanted to take over the oil

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:54.680
 fields of Russia and saw this read us a little bit of this but he says the English the English

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:59.320
 Rothschilds were alarmed when the socialist tendencies of the I don't know how to say this

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:05.960
 emigres contributed to a massively disruptive Taylor strike in the east end of London in

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:15.640
 1888 a young Georgianian communist who would become known to the world as Joseph Stalin was

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:21.000
 already organizing laborers to strike at the Rothschilds oil interest in bottom and let me just

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.720
 get one other critical part here. This spurred protests and riots and young Stalin himself led

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:34.680
 the agitation against the Caucasian oil industry in general and the Rothschilds in particular

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:41.480
 and so one is is that line up with your view of history and what if a person were to go

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:47.880
 against the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers what kind of disinformation campaign would be

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:58.200
 launched against them? Oh well the German system very early got

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:09.480
 integrated through the Delos brothers with what became the CIA and the British and the Germans

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:24.040
 were early aiming to destroy the Russian Empire because they had other plans for that part of

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:35.240
 the world and Stalin was aware of these imperialist motives and from an early age even though he was

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:47.240
 a Georgian he was seeing the Russian Empire was less evil than the British and German empires

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:57.640
 so he was essentially a patriot as well as a labor leader from a very young age

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:13.240
 and several of the top Bolsheviks especially I think Lenin was at one point subsidized

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:23.640
 by the Germans and probably the British Trotsky very definitely by this Delos faction that included

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:41.000
 the Germans and the Rothschilds. Trotsky was a very effective anti-Zarist activist but he never

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:52.600
 betrayed the German American British interests so he went through the whole Bolshevik period

01:11:52.600 --> 01:12:01.080
 as essentially a German saboteur and at one point

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:12.600
 in connection with settling the First World War so Russia could withdraw from the war

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:27.560
 Lenin referred to Trotsky's behavior as treasonous but at that time didn't have the power to replace

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:39.480
 him. He was serving Lenin's and Stalin's interests even though they saw him as betraying Russian

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:52.760
 interests in favor of the Germans but after Lenin died Stalin remained an organizer against the

01:12:52.760 --> 01:13:04.840
 British and German interests where Trotsky continued right up until the time he was murdered to be

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:14.920
 effectively working with the FBI British and German intelligence.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:21.800
 So quick question about Trotsky do you think his murder had more to do with Stalin or more to do with

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:29.000
 the Western intelligence agencies? I always assumed it was Stalin because

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:36.360
 the Moscow trials of 1937 and '38 brought out

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:49.960
 such overwhelming evidence that he was deeply involved with all of the imperialists

01:13:51.400 --> 01:14:05.480
 and the Dewey commission that went to Mexico to exonerate Trotsky of the charges that he was

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:20.680
 working for the Germans, John Dewey really ruined his name for anyone who looks at what happened

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:32.760
 in that doey commission who was a whitewash job trying to cover up Trotsky's involvement with the

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:43.800
 Germans and the FBI. So right according to our Spotify analytics 18 to 34 is our big audience

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:50.520
 and with the rise of people like Jordan Peterson and people pushed towards conservative

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:57.160
 conservatism that we're going to receive hundreds of comments that say you know Ray

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:02.680
 is very smart in nutrition and he has no idea what he's talking about on a political front and so

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:12.280
 but besides the CIA program you know that was focused on anti-Russian sentiment like what else

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:21.240
 is there and I don't get it. It's much much much deeper than the CIA. The CIA is just

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:34.280
 just a surface organization but they used money from the Marshall plan. They got billions of dollars

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:49.160
 to penetrate every place they could, they were already inside most of the democratic governments

01:15:49.160 --> 01:16:02.120
 of the world acting as saboteurs but if you look at the nature of the US government

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:11.720
 the Wall Street putch or the the business plot against Roosevelt

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:25.320
 revealed by Smedley Butler. All they did when Butler exposed their plan they just made longer

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:35.560
 range plans to take effect when the second world war was over so they had to wait 12 years

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:49.080
 but the Hitler faction people who had medals awarded by Hitler for service to the Nazi cause

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:59.320
 these factions were in control of the democratic big city machines during the war

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:11.000
 and they declared their patriotism during the war but they didn't change their their Nazi sympathies

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:24.520
 and these people rigged the 1944 democratic convention to install their agent

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:36.200
 and so effectively Hitler Dulles puppet Harry Truman to take over the government so it was

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:48.200
 the same putch as they failed at in 1933 they got organized and succeeded and the Dulles

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:58.440
 brothers meanwhile had deeply integrated themselves even during the war with the Nazi

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:13.640
 intelligence apparatus and so the what we know as the CIA using vast funds such as the Marshall

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:28.120
 Plan money they simply continued the German basic purpose of working with the banks to rule the world

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:38.840
 in favor of the corporations so the whole illusion that they teach in high school and universities

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:50.200
 mostly of what the US has been doing in the 20th century it's just as false as the story they

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:59.240
 created with these like the Ukrainian and a whole series of so-called defectors

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:11.240
 who were just making up stories that the CIA gave them to to publicize well since anybody who likes

01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:18.600
 Trump is now like a Nazi what the the the problem with the Nazi philosophy is that you eugenics

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:25.240
 supremacy idea and then that is what we're all going through right now like that it's an extension

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:38.680
 of that idea is that right yep it was slightly embarrassed at the end of the world war so they

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:47.640
 they had to change the names of their eugenics journals to human biology or human genetics rather

01:19:47.640 --> 01:20:00.600
 than eugenics but the ideas didn't change they took a more acceptable form but there has been

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:13.480
 steady progress against the the more humanistic strains of American civilization

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:24.760
 supplanted by the the Dulles brothers alliance with the German and bikers factions

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:33.080
 have a question what do you think is at the core of this not even rival rival it's just this

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:38.840
 fundamental opposition between the west and for a lack of a better word the east with Russia

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:45.400
 being at its center which seems to have been going since at least the 1850s long before communism

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:51.640
 and and capitalism kind of formed as ideas there seems to be something deeper driving this to do

01:20:51.640 --> 01:21:02.040
 you know what that may be um the the empires made it very obvious what they wanted

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:17.160
 the British Empire wanted to absolutely control the world and slave that whole land mass including

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:29.560
 Russians and adding it to their Indian Empire and the Germans were envious and thought they could

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:42.120
 knock out the British Empire and rule all of those resource hoarding Asians and get their resources

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:57.320
 and the US and the bankers outsmarted the German nationalists so that they were a faction powering

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:10.200
 Nazism but they didn't have any of the good nationalist impulses that made the German people

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:25.640
 hysterically favoring Nazism it simply Nazism without the nationalism not not doing anything

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:36.440
 favoring common people moving straight to the control of all of the world resources

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:47.000
 directly by the very limited ruling population and then because Russia the Russian Empire

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.720
 the Soviet Union was powerful enough to say we're not going to participate in your plans or at least

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:57.400
 we're not going to we're not going to give up without a fight basically that they that automatically

01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:02.920
 made them target public enemy number one in the eyes of the financial powers because that's the

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:09.800
 one thing they can undermine them okay yeah yeah so just to put a bow on this you can't really

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:17.000
 understand the framing of Stalin without understanding his opposition to the banker families the

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:26.600
 Rothschilds the Rockefellers do you think that's accurate statement yeah he was actually defending

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:39.240
 the interests of the majority of the Russian people and was an actual patriot betraying

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:46.680
 he didn't make the deals with the imperialists in the first place like Lenin and Trotsky but

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:55.160
 Lenin very quickly betrayed the Germans and Stalin had never

01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:03.320
 gone down that pathway to power he went straight up from being a labor organizer

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:12.440
 and I did receive a few emails from people russians who disagreed with the characterization of Stalin

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:18.360
 like what what would you say to those people specifically are they they had great grandparents

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:29.320
 or grandfather grandmother who passed away well the the Russians since since Stalin died

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:45.640
 Khrushchev started it and then Gorbachev finished it off acting in conceding a lot of their power

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:57.400
 to to the west and the banks and Khrushchev started the the slandering of Stalin just totally

01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:07.560
 inventing history that ever happened and Gorbachev continued that so what russians have been hearing

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:20.120
 for more than 60 years is also a historical lies in line with what the CIA and the Germans were

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:25.560
 making up by the way I've never met a single Russian who spoke positively of Gorbachev

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:31.160
 they all considered him a sellout so the emails you may be even getting it they're probably about

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:35.800
 I mean they're they're not very positive of Stalin but if you ask those people about their opinion

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:42.440
 of Gorbachev I my guess is it's not going to be very positive either yes Gorbachev was was a

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:51.080
 teenager when the Nazis came through the Ukraine and somehow he survived and I've always suspected

01:25:51.080 --> 01:26:04.120
 that he was owned by the Nazis right from his teen years as a plant waiting to take power

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:11.560
 so I think to maybe a young conservative person they're they're fully aware that like something

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:17.560
 we've talked about like the Gloria Steinem CIA feminism is like some kind of psychological

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:23.880
 operation but they're not aware that this the anti-communism anti-Stalin is part of a

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:28.360
 is very similar and then they're their condition by it is that accurate

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:43.720
 oh yeah the the even very bright highly educated history students

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:53.160
 don't don't have a shadow of suspicion of how totally corrupt

01:26:54.280 --> 01:27:02.360
 history writing has been for 130 years or so in the United States and that's because the spider

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:06.840
 at the top of this is just completely concealed and you you don't hear about the Rockefellers the

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:13.800
 Rothschilds the DuPonts the Morgan's the Vanderbelts like these these families that can kind of

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:24.040
 influence everything are completely hidden from you yeah they are still governing like Wikipedia

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:29.320
 it's called at the the alleged Wall Street plots

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:46.520
 Wikipedia is a good 800 of these deep state powers well okay so it stands what we were talking

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:54.200
 about into modern day and just wrapping that up like again the Nazi the Nazism is the eugenics

01:27:54.200 --> 01:28:00.360
 philosophy and correct me if I'm wrong but there at the moment there are kind of two

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:09.560
 power factions one this got the liberal more Soros gates at L types or the what was

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:16.680
 technocratic yeah the technocrats and then Trump is kind of on this other side of religious

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:21.880
 prophecy or he's aligned himself with those people and in this situation the the trump the trump

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:26.840
 people are more pro-life than these kind of genocidal eugenics maniac people

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:41.400
 yeah unfortunately the most humanistic trend has got connected with with the craziest

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:51.560
 groups but they have a little bit of things in common in that they do want the the mass citizen

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:59.000
 citizenry in chains in some way shape or form it so is that why um again there's kind of uh

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:07.080
 acquiescence to to a lot of these like trump isn't opposing vaccines or opposing the lockdowns or

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:12.840
 or is that just because he can't he doesn't have power to do so well you know he invited

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:20.120
 when right after he was elected he invited Robert Kennedy jr to come to Washington to

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:29.720
 talk to him about heading a commission to investigate vaccines and then Pfizer donated a million

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:35.800
 dollars and Trump called Trump it's called Kennedy and told him the deal was off

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:42.120
 so again that's the self-reservation that you talked about a while ago is that right

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:48.680
 yeah yeah so so no politician is going to save us from this mess is that that's the bottom line

01:29:51.000 --> 01:30:06.440
 I yeah the um there were so many reasons that JFK was slightly hesitant about doing the the

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:17.800
 most evil thing is that the the CIA Nazi faction had and the in-store and for that slight hesitancy

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:32.600
 he was killed and uh everyone since then who has a brain knows knows that they can't act without

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:40.920
 to the extent that they do anything serious they won't live long enough to to see it happen

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:49.640
 um I have a it's like a relatable on the side note did you know Ray that there was a civil

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:57.080
 lawsuit filed um by the surviving relatives of MLK Martin Luther King and there was a court

01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:04.200
 decision um in a civil court which decided that MLK was the victim of a government led conspiracy

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:11.400
 and that was used to me too yeah there's a book written about it and the evidence is just

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:24.520
 overwhelmingly clear and um it's sort of I think the same person who wrote JFK the unspeakable

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:39.320
 about the covered up facts of of his assassination he attended the whole trial of MLK

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:49.480
 assassination and made made a really convincing case of how clear the evidence was

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:55.960
 have you ever met a person or has even heard of that trial to my knowledge nobody no American

01:31:55.960 --> 01:32:00.440
 that I've ever met no he has even heard that there was a trial that said MLK was killed by

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:10.840
 conspiracy. Yeah and probably very few people have heard that Robert Kennedy Jr.

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:26.040
 knows exactly who the agent was that killed his father the security guard that shot him in the

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:38.040
 back of the head with his gun in contact with his skull uh he uh he he sold the gun and uh told

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:45.800
 the buyer that it had been used in the crime but he told the police that the gun had been sold

01:32:46.840 --> 01:33:00.520
 six months before but uh he he worked for for for a uh a Pentagon uh financed uh uh industry in

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:11.080
 Los Angeles and just went to the uh hotel uh a week before the assassination uh so he was clearly

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:21.880
 put in place by the the deep state and uh that the evidence is available to to show that

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:32.280
 the uh well well accepted official story that 95 percent of Americans believe that it's

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:42.600
 absolutely disproved by uh many many bits of evidence. I just wanted to bring this up to you

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:47.000
 because I thought it was interesting. Ray I sent you a link to a movie a while ago I don't know if

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.760
 you remember it but it was called cold case hammer scold and there's actually a documentary

01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:56.680
 about dog hammer scold and and who killed him and why and they came to the conclusion like you said

01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:02.600
 that the CIA did it and they they even showed a photograph of the the ace playing card in the

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:08.920
 collar of dog hammer scold which is like a calling card of the CIA but in that movie they find like

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:15.640
 a kind of key witness and um they're they're interviewing him and they say you mentioned uh

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:20.840
 actively spreading AIDS and he goes there was a unit from simar one of the things we that we did

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:25.560
 was we went into African countries and the director says and how has that done exactly and he goes

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:31.080
 through inoculation and the director says through vaccines and he goes yeah through vaccines and

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:39.400
 so um and your estimation is like the delivery uh of vaccines is just like a kind of a diabolical

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:45.960
 concept in general and then and then I did a little bit more research about um the special I

01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:51.800
 know I'm all over the place I apologize but the special uh cancer special virus cancer program

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:59.400
 and dr boy graves who passed away mysteriously found a blueprint in an old book in it I'm not an

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:06.120
 expert you know but it looks like a diagram for the the manufacturing of HIV have you seen that stuff

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:14.440
 no I haven't seen that uh but um uh the I think the evidence is is

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:27.160
 it indirect but um you can't look at the contextual situation without knowing that they at least

01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:32.520
 we're trying to make something like HIV people were talking about it

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:46.440
 14 years before the HIV came on the scene people working at the germ warfare lab we're talking

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:58.440
 about that intent to make a racially specifically lethal virus that has been part of the germ warfare

01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:05.560
 culture for decades and then like you we can only presume that they they kind of failed right

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:11.960
 because coronavirus is not well assuming that it was created in a lab like it's not that deadly

01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:18.840
 and so there must have been some kind of change of plan and the maybe the vaccine is the the

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:28.360
 death the fast death agent rather than some kind of slow slow killing agent it I think they probably

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:40.440
 have very lethal equivalent vaccines but I think that the uh big picture is that they have made a

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:48.520
 lot of noise going back years that they were working on this sort of thing and that they were very

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:56.360
 careless and having hundreds and hundreds of leaks and getting that in the news for years so

01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:04.280
 the Chinese being sensitive to American germ warfare from their experience

01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:18.200
 they would react very quickly to any virus even if it was just a harmless cold virus because of

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:30.840
 that setup that the germ warfare people had been sloppy it was like sending a very pointed

01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:40.840
 message to China getting them to react powerfully and quickly stop the virus however deadly it might

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:50.200
 be within just a few weeks and go back to business but the whole purpose I think was an excuse

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:59.480
 look to Chinese did it we have to shut down our economy and create this

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:11.320
 great scare about a harmless virus no evidence has ever come out in fact the definition of an

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:21.160
 infection they haven't convincingly showed that anyone was hurt by the infection

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:32.040
 simply the presence of the virus and the sick person was enough to say here is a deadly virus

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:42.440
 but since almost all the people were already sick from something else the presence of a cold virus

01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:52.840
 you can easily connect any decline in their health to the presence of the virus

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:05.800
 the whole story of the virus by replicating causes the sickness that just isn't a proper

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:15.880
 virology the mechanism of getting sick is something that can be defined very clearly that they haven't

01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:26.200
 done it and so there's really no science whatsoever behind the idea of a pandemic

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:34.200
 have you seen some of the news coming out of China lately saying that they will not under

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:41.960
 any circumstances use the western developed vaccine they didn't say why I mean some people

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:45.880
 say oh because they want to develop they won't improve their grade but that's not what the

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:52.280
 statement said the state kind of it's kind of led to the underlying tone was we simply don't trust

01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:58.040
 those vials that will be sent to us and if you think we're going to be injecting our people with

01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:06.680
 that you're just crazy to expect something like this yeah right when people's I mean what what

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:12.120
 when people start going brain dead because they got the vaccine it our democrats gonna brain

01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:17.720
 a blame conservatives and conservatives are gonna blame uh democrats like it well how do you think

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:22.520
 that's gonna play out do you think there'll be some kind of realization of what's happening or

01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:27.080
 or are people so dumbed down that it's uh it'd be even difficult to figure it out

01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:32.440
 as they'll probably say it's being caused by something else

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:46.600
 caused produced by some other enemy maybe some products coming from Iran maybe pistachio nuts

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:53.720
 or something causing brain death so so do you so the do you there's evidence of things like that

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:58.920
 they've done before like uh releasing something extremely toxic and then blaming some other import

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:11.240
 or something like that yeah but mostly the easiest thing is not to notice it unless there is

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:21.640
 very very easy to make connection to your enemy if it's just people dropping dead suddenly

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:31.800
 you can't uh if it isn't easy to connect then they're just going to say it isn't happening

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:47.240
 like to decline in SAT scores starting around 1980 roughly they blamed that on

01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:55.160
 more poor people taking the test but when you look at the absolute scores it's the

01:41:55.160 --> 01:42:03.720
 the biggest decline within the high ranges of scores so something has been happening

01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:16.120
 broadly through the population for 40 years now affecting the brain especially the brightest

01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:23.640
 functioning brains have you seen some of the recent articles in the press which i was kind

01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:29.400
 of surprised to see uh wall street journal even new york times are now saying oh my god we destroyed

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:36.120
 the economy speaking of the u.s we made a mistake this was a horrible decision but it was it was

01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:44.040
 unavoidable we had to do it but oh god did did we act um so do you think there's maybe some honesty

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:48.280
 in that assessment now they're freaking out that i don't know third of the population the u.s will

01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:53.960
 be um you know unemployed potentially homeless and riding or do you think it may be like uh you know

01:42:53.960 --> 01:43:04.360
 just another game if you can imagine that everyone that the paper failed to read or even hear about

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:17.320
 eric smits publications and speeches and conferences laying out that plan uh uh over a year ago

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:30.520
 15 months ago uh is saying that exactly destroying the existing economy is necessary so we can be

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:40.680
 china to the uh automation artificial intelligence economy dependent on needs it so we have to

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:49.880
 destroy uh this old economy made up of small and medium sized businesses who who is schmitt aligned

01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:57.080
 with or like when did he uh become such a big player in kind of the i don't know the deep state or

01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:08.520
 the kind of the bank or relationships um well the pentagon was a financer uh of google uh and so

01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:20.360
 he was in uh early uh i i think that the the likelihood is that he was uh pentagon ally before

01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:27.640
 google came into existence even yeah he was a computer science professor um in a famous

01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:32.680
 programmer and if you look at his the history of the grants that he's been getting the vast majority

01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:43.560
 of them are dod and in the i know they're probably a lecture topic but like the relationship between

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:50.120
 kind of the um power elite and the pentagon are they taking cues from the philosophy of those people

01:44:50.120 --> 01:45:03.800
 or how does that work um the um the the philosophy is so so deeply connected to their religion

01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:17.160
 and uh their racial superiority feelings of meritocracy uh if you look at any of these people

01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:23.480
 they're they're going to be uh subscribers to the uh idea that we're in a meritocracy

01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:31.480
 and that that's what's happening that the power of the pentagon is pushing uh the best of everything

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:41.880
 uh evenly the so-called progressives like norm kamsky are committed very deeply to this genetic

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:52.600
 determinism uh uh that uh fits perfectly with with the old eugenics idea and uh the modern

01:45:52.600 --> 01:46:00.520
 technocratic meritocracy uh so i have a question about this genetic geneticism i mean there's been

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:08.600
 over a hundred years of pursuing medical therapies life extension you know uh you know eternal youth

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:15.000
 etc etc by developing the genetic nothing has come out of this like nobody can be that dumb

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:20.680
 and continue to hope blindly that something will come out of these therapies of this approach

01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:25.400
 actually this scientific approach considering that nothing has come out yet not not even something

01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:31.000
 that says you on the right path like how is that are these people brain damaged or is it is it more

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:38.440
 of a religious being a blind fit of blind faith yeah the blind faith thing it is a kind of uh

01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:50.040
 brain damage uh the uh Peter Duesberg uh got out of the uh war on cancer at a fairly early

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:59.240
 stage simply because uh his brain was working better uh nothing but brain function is needed

01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:08.840
 to account for it uh and people just can't accept the fact that uh 95 of their science professors

01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:17.160
 are hypnotized by these religious ideas and genetics and meritocracy and so on

01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:23.640
 a little a little bit related but uh i've been struggling with the concept of a person's

01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:30.120
 like aging like the rate of aging and then how healthy they are because uh correct me if i'm wrong

01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:36.200
 but maybe somebody could be a slow uh at a slower rate of aging but they could be like

01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:40.920
 extraordinarily sick like they could be a i don't know they could be into some weird

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:45.160
 stuff or something what how do you distinguish the two and am i even framing it right

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:53.640
 i i'm not sure what you mean like so maybe somebody is uh looks aesthetically like they're

01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:58.520
 not aging that quickly but they're like a pedophile or something like that's an extreme form of sickness

01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:09.000
 oh oh yeah hypothyroid people uh often have uh uh very even their bones are late to mature

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:18.520
 and uh the the um mucopoly saccharides in their skin uh make their skin look very youthful

01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:30.200
 into their 50s and then the underlying uh problems accumulated from hypothyroidism

01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:41.720
 show up and and the uh crash into uh uh heart disease or dementia or cancer or or something

01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:50.280
 very suddenly but uh they can uh seem to seem to be very juicy and youthful uh all the way through

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:58.600
 their 40s okay so they're like internally rapidly aging is that right yeah okay yeah yeah and it's

01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:07.240
 just uh keeping the skin stretched uh like when you when you feed a cow a lot of estrogen it

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:13.800
 retains water that looks all shiny and sleek uh in the same with with a middle-aged woman

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:22.520
 retaining subcutaneous water uh when she stops the estrogen suddenly you'll see

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:30.760
 creaky skin where have been shiny and sleek so what speaking of shiny and sleek i was just about to

01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:36.760
 say have you seen eric smith's face he always strikes me because no matter every time he speaks

01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:41.800
 to the camera he's in front of some kind of a audience his forehead and his entire face is

01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:46.360
 always shining and i always thought he's always sweating but he's not they actually asked him

01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:51.160
 several times and he said no it's just how that's just how i look because i have a youthful

01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:56.440
 a youthful appearance he claims that he's not sweating but his face is oh shiny and his skin is

01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:00.920
 always is always looking like it's just like he said something there's like water underneath

01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:10.120
 that's stretching it out that's interesting maybe he'll be flight shouldn't oh that's the other

01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:15.560
 thing um i've also noticed that uh people that that are uh youthful looking through like various

01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:20.680
 procedures or or hormonal treatments with estrogen in especially human growth hormone

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:24.840
 tend to have this appearance but then they seem to have a very sudden decline

01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:29.480
 um do you know what may be triggering this is it basically the system is finally giving up

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:38.920
 systemically uh yeah the the growth hormone uh uh uh is an oligosin some ways to estrogen it

01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:45.960
 increases the the deposition of of ground substance and can can make things

01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:55.880
 plump up and actually have more protein immaterial but they're being degraded structurally

01:50:55.880 --> 01:51:01.560
 so that it predisposes to things like kidney disease

01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:11.560
 age acceleration in cancer right yeah uh last question then i'll read the superchats then i'll

01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:16.360
 let you go ray thank you so much for um just sharing your time with us uh everybody listening

01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:22.360
 please give this episode a like uh comment and subscribe sincerely appreciate it um one one last

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:28.360
 question so ray like a 17 year old or 18 year old that is uh degenerating struct structurally like

01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:34.440
 his structure is breaking down and the 25 year old with the severe kind of um mental illness or

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:40.440
 whatever but that is not degrading they are they're adapting to stress in a different

01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:49.640
 different way but but it's both our sickness is that is that right yeah yeah sometimes just the

01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:57.960
 amount of protein in the diet uh a low protein diet uh can uh lead to very high cortisol

01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:09.560
 androgen ratio low d-h-e-a and and of uh pregnant alone high cortisol and that that makes your skin

01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:21.480
 look uh uh uh aging even when you're at 17 or 18 uh and that can be countered by getting your your

01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:32.280
 calcium and protein uh uh intake increased vitamin D and and thyroid correction uh and

01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:47.560
 things like the uh the the nerve diseases uh uh seizures uh schizophrenia uh basically uh brain

01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:59.800
 swelling conditions uh sometimes just antihistamines anti serotonin aspirin can alleviate what seems

01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:08.600
 to be a uh of severe psychosis okay thank you for that ray let me just read these really quickly

01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:16.120
 one one last question um uh speaking of the protein amount of protein in the diet do you think that

01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:21.080
 the protein requirements may be decreasing with age because the reason i'm asking this is that

01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:27.160
 there have been several studies showing um a significant extension of lifespan with a low

01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:32.520
 protein but high carbohydrate diet and there are several uh tribes in the amazon that have been

01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:38.840
 noticed to have that diet and they have almost no aging and no cardiovascular disease yeah i think

01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:46.760
 what they're doing is keeping down the uh mathyanine a tryptophane and cysteine which are the pro aging

01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:55.480
 parts of the protein uh and uh like cal or calorie restriction uh lower sos as well as

01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:07.960
 polyunsaturated fats and uh if you just uh uh lower those half a dozen uh specific uh uh stress

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:17.640
 promoting uh substances uh then the uh higher protein like if you get lots of glycine uh

01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:25.320
 and gelatin in your diet the protein doesn't have those uh age advancing effect okay one last

01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:29.320
 question because you reminded me of something ray if you were going to sit down and have some beef

01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:35.880
 uh and hypothetically you could only choose one would you balance it with calcium balance it with

01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:45.640
 gelatin or would you drink coffee to inhibit the iron absorption i i would um drink milk or uh

01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:56.040
 uh eat eggshells or something i i think balancing the the phosphate uh uh would would have priority

01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:59.240
 and then hypothetically the second choice after the calcium

01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:08.760
 i've taking aspirin to uh limit uh the uh iron absorption coffee and aspirin

01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:18.920
 part of their benefit is they help to reduce your iron load i'm so sorry right it is very

01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:23.240
 popular to talk about iron right now but one of the things that is not mentioned i know you've

01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:27.080
 done a lot of work on it maybe we could just uh talk about it quickly because i i kept you for

01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:33.960
 two hours but the estrogen and the hypoxia and the the low thyroid increasing the estrogen and and

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:39.400
 promoting the hypoxia that is what's making the iron accumulate and displace the copper

01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:44.840
 it's not it's not just uh right like this random iron overload situation is that right

01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:53.320
 um you know people have been animals as well as people have been tested

01:55:53.320 --> 01:56:04.760
 the amount of estrogen present in pregnancy uh causes an extreme increase in the efficiency of

01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:14.440
 iron absorption and retention and everything that estrogen does tells your body that

01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:23.720
 something is wrong with your respiration system and so it uh increases your ability to retain

01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:33.000
 iron as if that's going to fix the the respiratory system but in fact it reaches a point where it

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:42.040
 starts uh competing with copper and uh aging the system uh creating uh stress uh that

01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:49.960
 subtracts copper from your system so the iron overload is actually hyper estrogenemia is that right

01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:59.880
 to say um i think so in most cases and then if the iron saturation is high it's acceptable to give

01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:06.680
 blood given that's not a terrifying event but but aspirin and focusing on the dairy that's a

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:16.840
 long-term solution and yeah it's going to work pretty quickly though uh your turnover of cells

01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:25.640
 your metabolic rate is high uh you're sloughing off a lot of skin and hair and intestinal lining

01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:37.080
 that takes uh iron out uh every day uh so if you keep your your milk uh to meet ratio high

01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:47.000
 and have some aspirin and and coffee to restrict the absorption of any iron that is in your food

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:55.880
 you'll steadily get rid of the iron what about people that have donated like many many many times

01:57:55.880 --> 01:58:02.040
 throughout the year like what what is wrong with them like i like i i for like uh hemochromatosis

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:06.840
 i've read about people that give like blood every week for like a year like how is that possible

01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:14.600
 if they're absorbing it very efficiently or if they're liver and marrow

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:24.760
 were really stuffed with iron it can take take a lot of elimination to to get the level down so

01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:28.840
 so maybe their estrogen was just off the charts and in childhood or or something like that

01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:37.880
 uh yeah you you can carry a wrap around a lot of iron uh without any symptoms

01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:47.800
 as long as you're in a a good oxidizing state that that doesn't activate it and start the free

01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:53.720
 radical process awesome okay here are some superchats uh michael for a hundred dollars he says thank

01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:58.040
 you dr peat thank you michael sincerely appreciate linda bell for five dollars she says thank you

01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:03.080
 pj martinez for four ninety nine thank you pj sincerely appreciate it stephen uh stephan

01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:08.840
 gomas for four ninety nine um we can't uh ray would be here all day if we asked him questions of the

01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:14.040
 superchats but we appreciate it stephan all forward that to ray uh kristina tomaj for nineteen ninety

01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:21.160
 nine thank you dr peat uh thank you kristina uh prea a hundred for a hundred dollars god bless you

01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:27.720
 dr peat thank you uh prea uh harry burgos many long-time supporters of the show thank you guys for

01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:32.600
 twenty five dollars thank you harry uh machele i won't even try your last name for fifty dollars

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:37.400
 thank you so much machele appreciate it primitive initiative for twenty four ninety nine thank you

01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:41.240
 all for taking the time to share your knowledge and insights thank you primitive initiative and i

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:47.800
 received an email from kana who was twenty dollars and that was just a donation v email so i will

01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:53.480
 forward these alter ray ray just to confirm you are receiving the the paypal things i'm sending you

01:59:53.480 --> 02:00:00.280
 correct oh yeah thank you that that's from all these people uh that watch the show so

02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:06.040
 uh ray parting words you know i can't thank you enough for for joining us today georgie and i

02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:11.000
 we really uh feel honored to have you on but at parting words uh and i'm not sure when we'll meet

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:15.560
 again because i'll be going mexico so that might be a little sticky to find a internet situation

02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:25.480
 but parting words for everybody ray um no nothing special georgie dinkop uh i guess not much as well

02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:31.080
 except question for ray's newsletter i thought it was a little bit uh i don't want to say darker

02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:37.080
 than than usual but at least i read it this way do you think things are getting worse or they're

02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:44.520
 at this point stabilize at least socially politically etc i i think it's uh at the point

02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:55.640
 of getting extremely bad uh very fast if people don't rouse themselves to start acting intelligently

02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:05.320
 like uh tomorrow in in berlin there will be a big demonstration for civil rights

02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:16.760
 even though the berlin government said it was uh organized by virus deniers

02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:29.320
 next worst thing to holocaust deniers i guess well let's hope they succeed right because a lot is at

02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:38.280
 stake yeah hope hope a million people turn out one last thing before we leave ray how can people

02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:48.440
 subscribe to your newsletters oh uh ray peat newsletter at gmail.com and then uh same question

02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:55.240
 with your books how do they obtain those you can ask about them at that same address and same

02:01:55.240 --> 02:02:04.920
 with old copies of your newsletters yeah there's a list of digitized things that are ready to send

02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:13.160
 out we're still working on digitizing the rest of the 40 years that was my next question you have a

02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:18.520
 list of the like i was going through my collection of your newsletters and i i came across one i had

02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:23.400
 never seen before and so i mean that's funny because i go through that all the time so uh but you have

02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:26.920
 like a list of the names of all the newsletters searching i don't think under people understand

02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:37.960
 how many newsletters you have uh it's um 360 something like that well amazing awesome ray uh

02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:43.880
 thank you so much and serially appreciate it uh dorgy thanks a lot i mean it's always

02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:48.360
 in order to have you uh i i recommend maybe publishing these as a bundle and putting them

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:54.040
 in the library of congress i think just making them searchable um through through an institution

02:02:54.040 --> 02:03:01.000
 like loc library of congress i think you'll um increase the audience tremendously yeah i i'm hoping

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:10.200
 we can do that uh it's a long job getting these old typed manuscripts uh in digital form without

02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:17.320
 lots of mistakes right i think it will be worth it awesome guy if the listeners thank you guys so

02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:21.160
 much future listeners thank you so much ray thank you amazing to have you on georgie dean

 bye everybody okay thank you all there right

02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:34.840
 let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope

02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:39.960
 it is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome soviet missile threat

02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:45.720
 with measures that are defensive that has turned to the very strengths and technology

02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:51.720
 of spawn our great industrial base and that have given us the quality in life we enjoy today

02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:58.440
 what a free view could live secure in the knowledge but their security did not rest

02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:04.440
 upon the threat against an English retaliation to deter the soviet attack we could intercept

02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:09.080
 and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil with that of our allies

02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:14.280
 i know this is a formidable technical task one that may not be accomplished

02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:22.440
 victor technology is the high-flying hardware computer company which took a nose dive this

02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:25.640
 year may be bought out by the british fermified computer technology

02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:37.000
 piloting the space shuttle is very difficult to do one would think can a kid or a normal person

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.480
 actually pull us off well what i did when i designed this was i understood that problem

02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:47.880
 it seems the suite of technology has no limits san francisco this week the world's first robot

02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:53.720
 bar tender was unveiled robot can talk and take spoken waters and mix to 100 different drinks

02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:57.800
 but on the first test run robot pocket glass off the bar and off of the floor and on the

02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:13.720
 here all over the counter robots designer says there were still some bugs to work out

02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:43.720
 so

02:05:57.800 --> 02:06:07.880
 i call upon the scientific community in our country those who gave us nuclear weapons

02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:13.880
 to turn their great talents now to the cause of mankind or release to give us the means of

02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:21.240
 rendering these nuclear weapons infinite and obsolete tonight consistent with our obligations

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:26.040
 of the adn treating recognizing the need for closer consultation with our allies

02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:32.440
 i'm taking an important first step instant u.s retelliation nuclear war

02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:52.680
 in japan where high technology showcase consumers stare in wonder at the latest

02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:58.200
 festival live overtaken by the computer age the department store the law of a seaboo store is

02:06:58.200 --> 02:07:04.280
 proud of its technology it is worried that customers can feel it has lost the human touch

02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:33.880
 so

02:07:47.960 --> 02:08:03.880
 so

02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:32.120
 let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope

02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:37.240
 it is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome soviet missile threat

02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:43.000
 with measures that are defensive let us turn to the very strengths and technology

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:49.000
 but spawn our great industrial base and that have given us the quality of life we enjoy today

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:55.960
 what if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest upon

02:08:55.960 --> 02:09:02.360
 the threat against our aviation to determine soviet attack we could intercept and destroy

02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:06.360
 strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil for that of our allies

02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:11.560
 i know this is a formidable technical sense one that may not be accomplished

02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:19.880
 mr. technologies the high flying hardware computer company which took a nose dive this year

02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:24.840
 may be bought out by the british firm applied computer technology

02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:34.280
 piloting space shuttle is very difficult to do before we think can a kid or a moral person

02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:37.960
 actually pull us off what i did when i designed this was i i
