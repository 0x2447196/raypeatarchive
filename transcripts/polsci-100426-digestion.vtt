00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Hey and welcome to Politics and Science. I'm your host John Barkhausen. This week we continue with another

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.280
 archive interview that I did with Dr. Raymond Peat. He's a physiologist who lives in Eugene, Oregon and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.400
 he's been studying health and the history of science for his entire life.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.080
 He's pretty much the smartest person I've ever talked to.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:40.600
 Today this interview was recorded in 2010 on April 26th and it concerns digestion, mostly human digestion, but I think it relates to all mammals as well.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:51.600
 It's about how it works and how it affects us and the psychological and physical repercussions of good and healthy digestion.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.600
 So I hope you can digest some of the show and with that I'll let it get started. Here we go.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 I am pleased to tell you as the host of Politics and Science that I have on the show again today Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 Dr. Raymond Peat has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon with specialization in physiology.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 He's taught at colleges including the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 Universidad Cruzana, the Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico and Blake College.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 In addition to his science research, bi-monthly newsletter and other writings, some of which are available at RayPeat.com,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.600
 he conducts private nutritional counseling. Hopefully, Ray, are you there?

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.600
 Yes, hello.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 Good, welcome back. I'm basing our discussion today on one of your recent newsletters.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.600
 Ray Peat's newsletter is available, I think you can find out about it, at the website RayPeat.com.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:10.600
 They're always interesting and this one is from January 2010 entitled "Cascara Energy, Cancer and the FDA's Laxative Abuse."

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.600
 And I thought I'd use it as a takeoff point to talk about digestion in general,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.600
 which I don't think there's much coverage of that in the media at all and yet it's something we all have to do.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.600
 And I thought, Ray, that perhaps you could start off by defining what you consider to be digestion in a healthy organism or a healthy human.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:42.600
 Well, everything should work smoothly. The food should be appetizing so that it stimulates the whole system.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 Pavlov was one of the pioneers in really studying digestion scientifically.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:03:05.600
 He showed that the knowledge of the food and the sensory quality of the food completely dominates the digestive process.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:17.600
 And recent experiments show that the taste of the food will even affect your blood sugar.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.600
 If you eat something sweet, it will actually raise your blood sugar.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:34.600
 Even if your throat is cut, it's a nervous connection that tells you that you're ready to start using food.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.600
 So even if the food doesn't get in your blood, the taste of it will start raising your blood sugar.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.600
 Pavlov isn't widely studied.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:55.600
 There continue to be some digestive experiments,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:05.600
 but now they're mostly done by the pharmaceutical industry and such things as what ferments do to digestion and so on.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:20.600
 But there's a long scientific history of digestive processes, mostly on animals, a few on people.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.600
 Walter C. Alvarez was a famous gastroenterologist who had a newspaper column,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:38.600
 and he helped get some scientific information into the general culture regarding digestion.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.600
 When did that happen, Ray? When was Alvarez writing?

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.600
 In the '40s and '50s. Well, he did much of his scientific work in the '20s and '30s,

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.600
 but he became a popular columnist in the '40s and '50s.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.600
 I see.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:09.600
 And after his time, most of the good research was done on animals and related to agriculture, mostly.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:17.600
 Some of it was just basic knowledge of how the intestine and digestive organs work.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:25.600
 For example, they would isolate a loop of intestine so that they could measure the blood going in and out

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.600
 and then put certain foods in that little piece of intestine and watch what happens.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:41.600
 That was sort of getting detailed information on the general work that Pavlov had done,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:49.600
 showing how the organs would respond to the nervous stimulation.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.600
 They found, for example, working with the intestinal loops, that the more complex the food in the intestine,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.600
 the more vigorously the digestive process worked.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:13.600
 So that one kind of experiment shoots down a whole bunch of dogma regarding food mixing

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.600
 or eating things in certain combinations.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:25.600
 The most complex mixture seems to be the one that digests the most efficiently.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.600
 And predigestion has been advocated for foods like proteins,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:45.600
 but in one experiment the digestive enzymes were stirred with acid and some protein to be digested.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:54.600
 And just stirring it at body temperature didn't do much digestion.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:03.600
 But when they added a piece of the intestine that had been washed and sterilized and fixed,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.600
 so it was basically just a structural framework,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:16.600
 adding that structural bit of intestinal tissue, suddenly the protein digestion went full speed.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:26.600
 So it isn't just the enzymes in the liquid that digest the proteins into amino acids,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.600
 which can then be absorbed.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:38.600
 The protein has to be in a certain configuration held in place by the surface fuzz of the intestine

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.600
 before the enzymes can efficiently work on it.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.600
 And since it's digested in contact with the cells,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:55.600
 then the amino acids are absorbed immediately as they're liberated from the protein.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.600
 And after the age of one,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:13.600
 a person's digestive system doesn't do very well with free amino acids compared to the whole protein.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:22.600
 So basically the food in the close to living state complex,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:34.600
 and structurally more or less just mixed by chewing is all it needs in preparation.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:45.600
 And something that a lot of people don't think about is that humans don't have the enzymes for digesting

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:55.600
 a lot of the plant materials such as cellulose, lignin, and other structural materials.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:02.600
 So that if we just simply chew vegetables,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:08.600
 most of the material, unless we chew it for half an hour each bite,

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:15.600
 a lot of it is going to be still trapped in the undigestible framework,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.600
 and bacteria in the intestine can then get at it.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:29.600
 And so you're supporting bacterial growth when you eat most vegetable material,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.600
 depending on how fibrous it is.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.600
 So they're always recommending we eat fiber,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.600
 so I can see that that could be a problem.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:44.600
 But before we get into solutions for digestive problems,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:50.600
 maybe you can cover what some of the basic problems,

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.600
 causes, and stages of the different types of digestive dysfunction there are.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.600
 I mean a lot of people are allergic to things, and there's toxins.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.600
 There's also just, as you were talking about Pavlov,

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.600
 and how the mind works in interaction with digestion.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:15.600
 I know a lot of people who are stressed out and have trouble digesting when stress is high.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.600
 Yeah, just the nervous tension will make things slow down.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.600
 Adrenaline will make your intestine stop moving.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:37.600
 It's an adaptive thing, so the fight or flight reaction isn't interrupted by intestinal activity.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.600
 So high adrenaline will not only shut down the movement of the intestine,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.600
 and the secretion of digestive fluids,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.600
 but it even reduces the circulation to the intestine.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:58.600
 And if it's too intense, it prolonged shutting off the blood supply.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:05.600
 It happens more in old people, but the chronic exposure to adrenaline

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:13.600
 can actually cause some of the intestine to die from lack of blood circulation.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:20.600
 Short of that, prolonged stress, by reducing the circulation,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.600
 it makes the intestinal wall become a poor barrier,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.600
 so that more toxin leaks through when you're in an anxious state,

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.600
 if the anxiety is prolonged,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:42.600
 so that the intestine isn't getting enough blood to maintain its barrier function.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:53.600
 Some types of hormonal disturbances will increase your activity of the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.600
 the opposite of the adrenaline site,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.600
 and that often goes with high histamine release.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:07.600
 And when histamine is released, serotonin is often excessive too.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:15.600
 For example, in low thyroid people, there is often an excess of all of the transmitter substances.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.600
 Sometimes it goes in the direction of serotonin, sometimes adrenaline.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:26.600
 And serotonin and the parasympathetic system and histamine

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:34.600
 all excite the muscles of the intestine, cause it to contract and even go into spasm.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:40.600
 And sometimes the spasms will shut off function,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:48.600
 but more often overactivity of that site will produce diarrhea.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:56.600
 So the type of your nervous distress can make a big difference.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.600
 I see. And as our digestion gets out of balance,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.600
 either it tends towards constipation or diarrhea.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.600
 And is one worse than the other?

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.600
 Are the remedies different?

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:18.600
 Well, in constipation, if it's associated with high adrenaline,

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:26.600
 the constipation tends to cause prolonged absorption of bacterial endotoxin.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:32.600
 And in an acute case of diarrhea, things are washed through so fast

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:38.600
 that it often reduces the absorption of toxins.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:47.600
 So just as a rough generality, occasional diarrhea is probably somewhat therapeutic.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.600
 But chronic constipation, for thousands of years,

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:58.600
 they've known that it's associated with cancer and other diseases.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:04.600
 Just recently I've been seeing cases of people with chronic constipation

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:10.600
 and bowel problems who are having strokes, aneurysms,

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:18.600
 and abnormal clotting and stroke hemorrhages

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:28.600
 are now known to be promoted by endotoxin and the inflammatory responses to the endotoxin.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.600
 I know you've written about endotoxin quite a bit,

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.600
 and I've talked to some other medical people about that,

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.600
 and they've never heard of it, and I find that quite remarkable.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.600
 Why don't you describe how that occurs?

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:50.600
 Okay. If you feed the bacteria, that's one factor that you can grow a culture of.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.600
 Bacteria are especially harmful if you are under stress,

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.600
 so your intestine lets too much of that into your bloodstream.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.600
 That's another stage of the problem.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:08.600
 If you don't feed your liver and keep it well energized

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:14.600
 with the right amount of thyroid hormone and a good vitamin/mineral/protein supply,

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:23.600
 your liver won't be able to detoxify any of the endotoxin that reaches the liver,

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:33.600
 and then the defensive response is a little bit of endotoxin leaking in all the time.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.600
 You want to keep this in an immunologically toned-up state

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.600
 so that it can be like exercise.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.600
 It gets you ready for more intense stress.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.600
 But if your liver is letting too much of it through,

00:15:51.600 --> 00:16:01.600
 then it gets you into the chronic state of inflammation.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:06.600
 People injured in a serious accident,

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.600
 often when they're taken to the hospital,

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:15.600
 all of their organs will suffer, kidneys, lungs, liver.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.600
 All of the major organs will tend to lose function.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:29.600
 Endotoxin is the main thing that is involved in that multiple organ failure.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.600
 Where it's just a chronic process,

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:41.600
 the same reactions to endotoxin, the inflammatory reactions,

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:50.600
 produce the degenerative changes in the blood vessels and the brain,

00:16:50.600 --> 00:17:00.600
 promote tumor formation from chronic inflammation that can't be healed and corrected.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.600
 All of the degenerative diseases are the last five or ten years.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:12.600
 That's one of the very biggest areas of medical research.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:18.600
 So there's a tremendous new increase in endotoxin

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.600
 and its role in degenerative diseases.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:32.600
 Coinciding with this, the FDA has outlawed all of the traditional laxatives.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.600
 I see.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.600
 Well, before we move on to some of what the FDA is up to,

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.600
 so endotoxin is a bacteria that's always with us,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.600
 but we can usually keep it under control,

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.600
 and it just gets out of control under stress situations?

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:56.600
 Yeah, with aging and/or stress, our liver is less able to detoxify it.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.600
 And other organs have some of the detoxifying enzymes.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:06.600
 Our brain is pretty rich in detoxification systems,

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.600
 but the liver is the main one to be concerned about

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:18.600
 if the intestine is stressed enough that a lot of it is getting through.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:30.600
 And low thyroid function is one of the things that makes the liver very weak at detoxifying things.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:35.600
 And one of the things the liver always has to detoxify,

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:42.600
 endotoxin is always there unless we're raised in a germ tree bubble,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:51.600
 but estrogen is always there too, especially in women after puberty.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:59.600
 The liver tends to slow down under the influence of estrogen,

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:09.600
 and that tends to let estrogen increasingly interact harmfully with other systems

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:19.600
 so that you get some very similar effects from overexposure to endotoxin or to estrogen.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:27.600
 They both activate some of the blood vessel leakiness and inflammation,

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.600
 leading to degenerative diseases.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.600
 Now, inflammation in the digestive system,

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:40.600
 first of all, what is inflammation and how does it affect our digestion?

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:50.600
 The first thing that happens with endotoxin and/or estrogen

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:55.600
 is the production of too much nitric oxide,

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:06.600
 and one of the ways that that makes capillaries leak is that it makes them take up too much water.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:12.600
 And one of the ways these toxins cause cells to take up too much water

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:19.600
 is by knocking down their oxidative metabolism.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:29.600
 The nitric oxide poisons the mitochondria so that they can't produce energy very fast,

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.600
 and as the energy production goes down,

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:42.600
 the cell simply swells up and gets looser in structure as it fills up with water.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:49.600
 That increases the leakiness and lets more of the toxin get through.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:21:01.600
 And as this proceeds, it goes from the capillary admitting more of the toxin

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:07.600
 to the surrounding connective tissue, taking up more and more water,

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.600
 and the wall of the intestine as well as the wall of the blood vessel,

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.600
 on the small level, the wall of the blood vessel gets thicker

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:26.600
 so that it cuts off the delivery of oxygen and contributes to the problem.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.600
 And as the oxygen supply goes down, the cells produce lactic acid,

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.600
 and the lactic acid triggers more of the inflammatory substances,

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.600
 and the wall of the intestine takes up more and more water

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:49.600
 through all of the layers of muscle, connective tissue, blood vessels, and so on,

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:54.600
 until at an extreme state.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:02.600
 Many people have seen x-rays of their intestine after they've taken a barium meal,

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:09.600
 and you can see places where there are big wads of the opaque white material,

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:15.600
 and other areas where there's none at all, or just a little thread of it

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.600
 going down a channel in the intestine.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:26.600
 That's often caused by the intestine becoming so thick that there's no space left

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:30.600
 for the movement of food or liquid down the channel.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:37.600
 Even the barium liquid can't find a channel to get through.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.600
 So that's the worst kind of constipation,

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.600
 is where the intestine swells up with massive amounts of water

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:52.600
 instead of being a membrane-like, tough, muscular organ.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:57.600
 It becomes a big, fat, heavy, sausage-like organ.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:04.600
 And you're saying that swollen, watery state is basically a state of inflammation.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.600
 Yeah.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:12.600
 And the first, simplest remedy for that for many people

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:22.600
 is just to take some aspirin and Benadryl to lower the inflammatory mediators.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:30.600
 And the reason aspirin works is that people have consumed too much of the polyunsaturated fats,

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.600
 which then turn into prostaglandins,

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:43.600
 which are one of the endpoints of causing inflammation and water-logging.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:50.600
 And histamine release is defended against by the antihistamines.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.600
 And so to reduce the risk in the long run,

00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:04.600
 it's important to minimize your intake of those precursors of the inflammatory prostaglandins.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.600
 I see. So you recommend not eating unsaturated fats because of that.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.600
 Yeah.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:19.600
 So moving along,

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:26.600
 and part of the digestive process is peristalsis, where your, I guess,

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:32.600
 your actual intestine has a contraction that moves down the length of it and moves food along.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:39.600
 Yeah. And if they're water-logged, the muscles simply can't contract.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:46.600
 It's like if your arm swelled up to be two feet in diameter,

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.600
 you wouldn't be able to bend it.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.600
 That's right. That's a good point.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:25:01.600
 So now you mentioned aspirin helps a lot as an anti-inflammatory.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.600
 Are there other techniques?

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.600
 And I'm curious, if you go to a doctor,

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.600
 what's the normal recommendation for, say, somebody coming in who's constipated?

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:20.600
 Oh, they tell them to drink more water or they give them starch-like material that binds water

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:26.600
 and makes the stool moister.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:32.600
 That's pretty much the standard approach to think of it as just a mechanical problem.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:41.600
 But having a moist stool is nice if you have an intestine that can pass it along,

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:46.600
 but if it's swollen shut, that isn't going to do any good at all.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.600
 And in fact, some of those things can support bacterial growth.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:26:00.600
 And so very sick people sometimes just basically tend to swell up with gas

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:05.600
 when they take those instead of having a laxative action.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.600
 Are there situations where peristalsis stops

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:16.600
 and you can use something that would get it contracting again?

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:23.600
 Sugar is one of the very effective things, sugar and salt, because they lower adrenaline.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:33.600
 And if stress has stopped your intestine just because of adrenaline excess,

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:40.600
 sugar and salt and maybe a little quick thyroid supplement can get it going again.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:46.600
 Hypothyroidism, one of the classical symptoms is chronic constipation.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:54.600
 But now that so many people are getting drugged,

00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:01.600
 there are a lot of opiates that are being widely prescribed.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:12.600
 Morphine and opium, everyone knows that they can cause terrible constipation.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:19.600
 But the intestine is normally a very rich source of endorphins,

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.600
 the natural endogenous opiates.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:30.600
 And so that's one of the ways stress increases the endorphins,

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:36.600
 and the endorphins act just like exogenous opiates do.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:41.600
 They tend to stop the intestinal action.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:48.600
 So several people have been proposing the anti-opiates

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:55.600
 that have been used for many years for treating heroin overdoses and so on.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:02.600
 They are seeing that they can cure chronic spontaneous constipation

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:07.600
 just because stress so often increases the endorphins

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:14.600
 to the point that they get a morphine-like constipation.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.600
 That's very interesting.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.600
 So in hypothyroidism as a cause of digestive problems,

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:27.600
 and particularly constipation, is the medical world aware of that?

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.600
 Oh, they used to be 50 years ago.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:37.600
 Doctors knew that constipation and dry skin and falling hair

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.600
 were the most common signs of hypothyroidism.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:50.600
 But after the Second World War, medical education changed from perception

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:55.600
 to following instructions of the drug salesman.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:01.600
 Nowadays it doesn't occur to most doctors to look at the common signs

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:08.600
 and see a simple endocrine solution.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.600
 We're talking to Dr. Raymond Peat, who's a physiologist

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:17.600
 and has a PhD in biology, and we're talking about digestion today.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.600
 You're listening to Politics and Science.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.600
 We're about halfway through.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.600
 I know some people who have been prescribed a product.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:34.600
 I think it's called Imodin, and I was lent some of that once when I had diarrhea.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.600
 I don't believe I had another movement for about three weeks after that.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:44.600
 I was curious if you knew what that was and how it acted.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.600
 No, I don't know what it is.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.600
 I think I've seen it advertised.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:30:01.600
 It happens to sound sort of like the good substance in some of the natural oxidates, Imodin,

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.600
 but I think the one you mentioned is spelled I-M-M.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.600
 Yes, I believe so.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.600
 Yeah, and we should probably talk about Imodin

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.600
 and the FDA's position on that at this point.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.600
 Maybe you could describe sort of the history of its use

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:26.600
 and where it comes from and what its status is in terms of mainstream medical practice.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:33.600
 The main traditional laxatives were herbs.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.600
 Sometimes minerals were used, like sulfur.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:45.600
 Flowers of sulfur works as a laxative, but the most common were herbs.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:52.600
 Tobacco was sometimes a component of laxatives,

00:30:52.600 --> 00:31:03.600
 and that increases the tone of the intestine.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:10.600
 An herb, noxvomica, is an old one that started.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:19.600
 It contains strychnine, and that went out of the laxative world about almost 100 years ago.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:31.600
 The component that remained was Imodin, which is in cascara and aloe and rhubarb fruit.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:43.600
 It has many protective effects other than helping cure constipation.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:53.600
 But a medical mythology that grew up sometime in the 20th century

00:31:53.600 --> 00:32:00.600
 was the idea that these natural laxatives were stimulants.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:07.600
 But if the intestine isn't swollen,

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:15.600
 you can stimulate it with something like histamine or serotonin.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:25.600
 But the idea was that the natural laxatives were stimulating the nerves and muscles to contract.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.600
 That was just a mistaken definition of them.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:38.600
 The other medical idea, fear of stimulants,

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:46.600
 because of the idea that stimulation was going to be addictive,

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:52.600
 around that same time, euphoria became a very bad word.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.600
 Stimulants might cause euphoria.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.600
 Incidentally, a good laxative can cause euphoria,

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.600
 but you shouldn't mention that to your doctor.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:11.600
 But the myth of stimulating by using a laxative

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.600
 was what led doctors to advocate drinking more water

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:21.600
 and taking one of these bulk-forming, water-binding laxatives.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.600
 To support their recommendation,

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:35.600
 they claimed that the stimulating laxative would cause the colon to turn brown or black.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:44.600
 That was supposed to be proof of their harmfulness and addictiveness.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:54.600
 But it turns out that constipation, the constant irritation of the intestine as a defensive reaction,

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:59.600
 often produces a brown or black pigment.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:07.600
 So the idea that the brown substance, like cascara or dried aloe,

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:16.600
 became an image in most doctors' minds that it was going to cause this melanosis of the intestine,

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:21.600
 but that just isn't scientifically supported.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:26.600
 So doctors were using cascara, sagrada, and aloe?

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:34.600
 Yes, that was an old laxative called Nature's Remedy.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:43.600
 It was for many years, I guess about 100 years, contained just aloe and cascara.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:49.600
 But about 20 years ago,

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:56.600
 the cancer drug industry started doing research with some of the chemicals

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:06.600
 in the same chemical family as the active ingredient of aloe and cascara.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.600
 One of these was pretty effective at killing cancer,

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:17.600
 but slightly after killing the cancer, it would kill the heart.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:24.600
 It was a synthetic derivative of some of these natural compounds,

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.600
 such as anthraquinones.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.600
 Anthraquinones, you said.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.600
 Yes.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:38.600
 And when this cancer drug was found to kill the heart,

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:49.600
 that research led to look for variations that wouldn't kill the heart,

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.600
 but would still kill the cancer.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:36:00.600
 And that eventually led them to reinvestigate all of these natural substances.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:06.600
 And it turns out that the Imodin is a good cancer drug,

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.600
 even though it doesn't kill your heart.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.600
 But it's a natural substance,

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:17.600
 and so they're still working on how to make a synthetic, patentable version of it

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:23.600
 that they can sell as a cancer drug that doesn't kill the patient.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:32.600
 But because of the involvement of the cancer industry,

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:41.600
 the FDA began putting out warnings that the natural substance might cause cancer

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:47.600
 because it vaguely resembles some compounds that do cause cancer.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.600
 But there was never research to support that.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:56.600
 But that added to the laxative addiction doctrine

00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.600
 and the black intestine doctrine,

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:09.600
 and the FDA used that cancer risk mainly to outlaw the natural substances

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.600
 to be sold as laxatives.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.600
 But coincidentally, as they were using that argument,

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:24.600
 within a matter of weeks they granted approval to a drug called Xelnorm,

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:34.600
 which was a synthetic that intensified the serotonin effect

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:40.600
 to simply overstimulate the intestine.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:50.600
 The FDA, following all of this worry about avoiding stimulant laxatives,

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:57.600
 they approved a synthetic that was nothing but a very powerful stimulant,

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.600
 simultaneously with taking off the natural laxatives.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:06.600
 So the market was wide open for this Xelnorm product to be sold

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.600
 at three or four dollars per tablet.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.600
 And since there was a captive market for it,

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:20.600
 they were making something like a billion dollars a year for several years

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:27.600
 until too many people started having their colons die

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:33.600
 or other parts of their intestine die and have to be removed.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:41.600
 And the drug was authorized for a maximum of, I think it was four months,

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.600
 with a possible repetition of a four-month period.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:51.600
 But after that the doctors were required not to prescribe it anymore,

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.600
 even though the company was making so much money.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.600
 And patients did have to use it.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.600
 But the instruction was that after the allotted four-month time,

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:08.600
 then they had to find a laxative solution.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:16.600
 So the FDA knew that there was no permanent good laxative solution

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:22.600
 and that in Europe it was outlawed because it killed people's intestines.

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:28.600
 But the FDA let them go for about five years, making their billions,

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:35.600
 and then outlawed it but gave them a period of several months

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:41.600
 to use it as an investigational new drug,

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:47.600
 simply a way to let them keep it on the market

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:58.600
 and re-educate the doctors and sort of get out of it, saving some face.

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.600
 From the way you describe that, I think listeners can tell

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:06.600
 that you feel that the FDA is a captured agency, basically working hand in hand.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:14.600
 It would be interesting to see how rich the people in the FDA got after that episode.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.600
 Traditionally, that's what happens.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:26.600
 The people involved in approving bad drugs very often wind up very rich.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.600
 I think we've all seen that or heard about it,

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.600
 where people working for the drug industry rotate out of their drug industry job

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.600
 into regulatory agency jobs, and then when that's finished

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:43.600
 and they've done their job there, they move back into the drug industry again.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:52.600
 Not a very healthy practice for running a government serving the public good.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:41:02.600
 The FDA's involvement in these chemicals goes back much farther than just the laxative issue

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:08.600
 because this family of chemical, the quinones,

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:14.600
 was found 100 years ago to be protective.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:22.600
 Well, the herbal medical people have used it for hundreds of years,

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:32.600
 but scientists 100 years ago started getting interested in the cellular effects of substances

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:48.600
 such as imodin from aloe and cascara, and many colored plant substances contain analogous materials.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:58.600
 But W.F. Koch was experimenting with the anti-cancer effects of these materials

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:07.600
 as early as the 19-teens and set up a clinic using them in the 1920s.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:16.600
 The FDA, by the 1940s, were determined to shut him down.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:24.600
 That story of his trials and the FDA involvement is a good introduction to the politics of science

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:29.600
 for anyone who wants to read about it.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:37.600
 There were two trials, but he won both trials because so many of his patients were there to testify

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.600
 and he had the evidence that they had been cured of their cancers.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:50.600
 But he moved to Brazil so he would be less persecuted by the FDA.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:56.600
 And he was producing variations on the quinones? How did you say that?

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.600
 Yeah, the quinones.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.600
 Quinones.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:10.600
 And the FDA's response was that quinones are toxic and he demonstrated in court

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:15.600
 putting a certain amount of a simple quinone into water

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:22.600
 and then diluting it to the strength that he had adjusted, that he injected in the patient.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:30.600
 And the FDA said there's none in there, but the jury had seen him put it in and dilute it.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:36.600
 But the FDA's instruments weren't good enough to detect it,

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:42.600
 so they said there's none there, it can't have been what cured the patient.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:49.600
 And they said if there was any there, it would be toxic because quinones are toxic.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:55.600
 But about eight years after his second trial,

00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:05.600
 ubiquinone or coenzyme Q10 was discovered and found to work exactly as Koch had described

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:12.600
 the function of the quinones that he was using and extracting from plants and such

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:18.600
 as stimulating mitochondrial oxidative metabolism

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:26.600
 with all of its anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-spasmodic,

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:33.600
 anti-cancer, pro-differentiating, anti-infective effects.

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:38.600
 So his treatment was basically just helping your cells go back to a healthy state.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.600
 Yeah.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:51.600
 And the fame, he wasn't allowed to publish in any English language medical journal

00:44:51.600 --> 00:45:02.600
 after about 1914 or 1917 was his last publication in an English journal.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:07.600
 But in European and South American journals, he became famous.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:19.600
 And Albert Centorgi, who came to the US a couple of years after Koch's world-famous win against the FDA,

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:31.600
 Centorgi was researching exactly the same electronic oxidative systems in the cell

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.600
 when he was working in Europe.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:41.600
 That was the basis for his Nobel Prize, much of it besides the vitamin C.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:47.600
 Vitamin C was sort of incidental to working on the cellular energy metabolism.

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:54.600
 But Centorgi never mentioned the name Koch because if he had,

00:45:54.600 --> 00:46:03.600
 he would have gotten the same treatment from the FDA by associating himself with Koch,

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:06.600
 who had been so thoroughly persecuted.

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:15.600
 But throughout his life, Centorgi kept following the Koch approach

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:22.600
 to how cell oxidative processes are essentially,

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.600
 they're an essential part of the life process

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:36.600
 and so are the proper place to focus in treating diseases of muscle, nerve function,

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:43.600
 cancer, growth functions, and basically all biological processes.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:52.600
 So the Imodin you were speaking of that was used as a laxative over the traditional medicine,

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:57.600
 and that was actually doctors could prescribe that up until when was the Zell norm?

00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.600
 When did that come out?

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.600
 2002.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:06.600
 So and at this point, doctors aren't allowed to prescribe Imodin?

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.600
 I think they can prescribe it, but it can't be sold as a laxative.

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:14.600
 They can just prescribe it as a substance.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.600
 I see, as a food supplement or such.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.600
 Yeah.

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:20.600
 I see.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.600
 So where does it come from, Ray?

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.600
 I don't think anybody knows that.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:34.600
 Oh, well, the rhubarb root and the aloe leaf contain variations of the molecule,

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:46.600
 but the cascara bark all across North America and I guess similar latitudes around the world,

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:51.600
 it's a very common plant, and they just strip the bark off,

00:47:51.600 --> 00:48:00.600
 and in its fresh state, the bark will cause stimulation of the intestinal muscles

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:05.600
 and cramping and discomfort.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:10.600
 So traditionally, it was never used in its fresh state,

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:19.600
 and aging it for at least a year, the bark turns black, just like the color of bitter chocolate,

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:28.600
 and in that state, the soapy quality of the molecule has broken down,

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:35.600
 the glucose part has been removed so that it's an oil-soluble molecule,

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.600
 and in that state, it isn't an intestinal stimulant.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:52.600
 It's an anti-inflammatory, somewhat slightly sedative, energy-increasing substance.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:49:04.600
 It decreases many of the chemical processes involved in cancer and many stress conditions.

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:15.600
 Just recently, malaria was found to be toxic by activating a process that's essential to cancer,

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:27.600
 and so it could be that Imodin will turn out to be tried as a treatment for many other diseases

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:31.600
 other than cancer and constipation.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.600
 So it's interesting at the same time they're banning that,

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:44.600
 that other sections of science are starting to do some serious research on its efficacy.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:49.600
 Yeah, the cancer industry is--

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:55.600
 I suspect that they'll resort to using the natural drug

00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:02.600
 as an additive support for one of their patented drugs.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:07.600
 They've done that with several other substances, for example,

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:14.600
 adding caffeine to some of their cancer therapies

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:23.600
 and simple natural substances that in themselves have an anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer effect.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:32.600
 It turns out that it makes their cancer drug more effective and less harmful.

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:37.600
 So you're saying they patent something just so that they have the rights to it,

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:42.600
 and then they add the actually effective natural substance that they can't patent to it

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.600
 to make their patented thing effective.

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:55.600
 Yeah, that has become fairly common in the cancer drug industry.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:59.600
 And can you-- maybe it's too much to ask at this point.

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:03.600
 We only have about seven minutes left, but how does the Imodin work?

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:11.600
 Does it just basically get your cells to be producing energy the way they're supposed to be again?

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:19.600
 Yeah, I think-- well, the actual consumption of oxygen and production of ATP,

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:28.600
 I think that's secondary to a general tuning up.

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:40.600
 The natural substances, progesterone, caffeine, to some extent the thyroid hormones,

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:53.600
 these bind to proteins and cause the proteins' electronic behavior to change.

00:51:53.600 --> 00:52:03.600
 The respiratory chain in the mitochondria is in a way tuned up by the small molecules

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.600
 that are associated with it.

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:20.600
 Coenzyme Q10 helps it to take in energy without producing destructive oxidative reactions.

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:29.600
 And vitamin K, which is a quinone analogous to Imodin and the other--

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:39.600
 the anti-cancer and laxative substances, vitamin K increases the effectiveness of coenzyme Q10.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:49.600
 And there's an overlap with all of these natural regulatory substances

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:58.600
 that can only be explained as a sort of tuning up of the whole cell system.

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:08.600
 The quickest way to get at it probably is to look at St. George's last two or three books

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:21.600
 where he's talking about the various substances that act on DNA and proteins as a system,

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:27.600
 increasing the coherence of the cell electronically.

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:36.600
 And I don't think that these substances will be understood, or cancer or even hormone actions,

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:42.600
 I don't think will be understood unless the coherence of the cell's electronic system

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:50.600
 is taken into account so that the cytoplasm and its constant movement

00:53:50.600 --> 00:54:00.600
 and the nucleic acids and their responsiveness to these processes in the cytoplasm

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:05.600
 are integrated with what's happening in the mitochondrion.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:12.600
 So it isn't like a lock and key where the coenzyme Q10 or the quinone

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:16.600
 is just activating a single enzyme.

00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:22.600
 I think it's that they act in many places in a coordinated way

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:30.600
 with the natural efficient structure functioning of the cell.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:40.600
 And I think you said in your newsletter that the approach of Coke and St. Georgie

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:48.600
 is in contrast to, which is basically making your body healthier and able to deactivate toxins,

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:53.600
 is in contrast to what became sort of the mainstream medical approach

00:54:53.600 --> 00:55:02.600
 which was trying to target cancer cells and basically a war mentality.

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:11.600
 Yeah, I see that as something that has gone on ever since the divide

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:15.600
 in how the immune system is seen to function.

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:24.600
 Meshnikoff saw the immune system as a developmental process of the whole organism,

00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.600
 not just something aimed at killing germs.

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:38.600
 But the drug industry wanted to think of their product as a germ killing analog to the immune system.

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:46.600
 So they shut down the Meshnikoff approach and went to the kill the enemy approach.

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:54.600
 And that drug industry motivated attack against bacteria

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:59.600
 and immediately went over to the approach towards cancer

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:10.600
 as identifying the cancer as an alien mutant rather than as a dysregulation of a natural process.

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:17.600
 So instead of energizing the system to normalize the process of tumor development,

00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:25.600
 the whole industry is focused on having to kill the cancer as an alien.

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:29.600
 And going back to digestion, if people in just the minute we have left,

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.600
 if people are, I think you've touched on much of this,

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:40.600
 but if people are hoping to improve their digestion, natural food substances that they might use?

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:48.600
 Well, raw carrots, by having a germicidal effect on the bacteria,

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:53.600
 can be very helpful until you get your hormones working.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:57:06.600
 A good thyroid and steroid hormone system will make your intestine have the energy to control the flora on its own.

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:15.600
 In the meantime, daily raw carrot helps to keep down the endotoxin absorption.

00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:27.600
 And when they're available, cooked bamboo shoots are another good intestine protector that will hold down the endotoxin.

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.600
 So those are the fibers you would recommend?

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:41.600
 Yes, because the grain fibers turned out to cause bowel cancer in several research settings.

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:49.600
 And keeping your general nutrition up with adequate protein is the other main thing to make your digestion work.

00:57:49.600 --> 00:58:05.600
 So eating milk, cheese, and orange juice along with one of those protective disinfecting fibers will take care of most of the bowel problems.

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:09.600
 I'm afraid we are out of time, Ray.

00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.600
 So we'll have to cover some of that later.

00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.600
 But thank you so much for being on today.

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:15.600
 We'll talk to you soon.

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.600
 Okay, very good.

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.600
 Okay, goodbye.

00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:22.600
 And you've been listening to Politics and Science with your host, John Barkhausen.

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:24.600
 And my guest today was Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.600
 You can find out more about him at raypeat.com.

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:31.600
 That's R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.

 And you can find out a lot of his information by reading 70 or 90 articles he has posted at his website, raypeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:45.600
 All right, hope you enjoyed the show.

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:50.600
 Sorry about the bad sound quality, but I hope it was still digestible.

00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:57.600
 I've been your host, John Barkhausen, and please tune in again next week for another edition of Politics and Science.

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:58.560
