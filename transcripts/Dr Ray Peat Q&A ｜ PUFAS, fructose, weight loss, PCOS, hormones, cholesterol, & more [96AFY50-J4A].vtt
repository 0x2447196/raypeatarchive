00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.840
 - What's good everyone,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.840
 welcome back to the Strong Sisters YouTube channel.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.120
 In today's video, we have the pleasure and the honor

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.880
 of having Dr. Raymond Peat on our channel

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.320
 to discuss his views of nutrition and wellness.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.640
 So Dr. Ray Peat got his PhD in biology

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.080
 from the University of Oregon.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.080
 He specialized in physiology

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.520
 and he's interested in topics such as aging,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.000
 nutrition and hormones.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.920
 So Dr. Ray Peat is just a little ball of information.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.720
 He has dedicated so many hours to independent research

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.000
 and he puts all of this information online for free

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 for our benefit.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.100
 He's not backed by anything

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.200
 and he's not trying to sell you anything.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.560
 - That's one of the main reasons why we appreciate

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.560
 Dr. Ray Peat, he's not backed by any funding agency,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.760
 he's not trying to sell you any supplements or programs.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.840
 Instead he's just really interested in this

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.240
 and his views are likely going to challenge

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.640
 many of your views and I think that that's a good practice,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.200
 a good activity that we should all do every once in a while

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.600
 to really challenge our beliefs

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.360
 'cause that way we can grow and evolve.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.880
 So we are not saying that his claims are 100% right,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.860
 you're not going to agree with every individual

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.700
 on certain things.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.200
 But Dr. Ray Peat discusses some nutritional strategies

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.920
 or like principles and many people have kind of taken

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.680
 these principles and formulated what's called

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.960
 like a Ray Peat diet.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.040
 And so this diet can kind of be summarized by,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.760
 he believes that we should be carb fueled

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.440
 with easy to digest carbs

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.780
 and that you will get your nutrients in

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.520
 from animal products.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.840
 So we have definitely incorporated some of these principles

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.280
 into our diet a few months ago

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.000
 when we started to add carbs back in

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.880
 and it has worked well for us.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.140
 However, just a reminder,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.440
 there are no absolutes in the nutrition world,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.200
 we are all very different and so you have to experiment

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.300
 to find what works best for you.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.920
 So this conversation is just presenting

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.960
 another unique perspective on nutrition

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.160
 and we hope you enjoy.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.640
 So with all that said, Dr. Ray Peat,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.000
 didn't zoom us.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.180
 So we called his landline and therefore this video

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.520
 is an hour and a half of our video.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.000
 So like us, you get to see us reacting and typing

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.760
 and then just like a cute voice.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.360
 And so we-- - We enjoy that.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.680
 - Can only call his landline, he is 84 years old

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.000
 but can just bring up studies off the top of his head,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.520
 which speaks of his intelligence.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.320
 And we polled many people on Instagram

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.700
 and so these questions are just from the Instagram questions

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.400
 we did not get to all of them,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.320
 but hopefully we can have him on our channel again.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.920
 So if you guys have any more additional questions,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.120
 make sure you hit him in the comments below

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.200
 and hopefully we can get him on if he doesn't hate us too much

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.720
 I don't know, we'll see.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.320
 - He's great you guys, he's seriously so nice.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.160
 - So fun.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.680
 All right, well hope you guys enjoy this video.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.400
 We have polled our audience for some questions

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.160
 and then we also have some questions ourselves

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.840
 that are kind of divided into some different topics

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.920
 to just keep it organized.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.120
 We're gonna talk about like nutrition stuff,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.040
 weight loss, hormones, fertility, supplements

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.320
 and we'll just kind of see where the conversation goes

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.280
 if that's okay with you.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.120
 - That's fine.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.960
 - Okay, cool.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.040
 A lot of people are confused about

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.480
 what they should be eating these days.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.140
 So we have all like keto, carnivore, different diets.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.560
 If it were up to you, what are about five to 10

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.720
 essential food items that you would recommend

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.480
 somebody includes in their diet?

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.200
 - Special food items?

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.040
 - Just like--

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.860
 - Essential.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.160
 - So kind of the most, the food that people

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.460
 should prioritize they eat regularly.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:34.520
 - It really depends a lot on your situation.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.400
 But very, very safe and highly nutritious foods

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.200
 are convenient as well as safe in the long run.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.480
 Those include milk, cheese without additives,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.140
 eggs, low starch fruits, generally meat and fish

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:12.500
 that are not high in polyunsaturated fats.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:19.020
 And depending on your ability to digest food

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.880
 well cooked vegetables are very good for most people.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:34.200
 What I've left out are mostly grains, legumes

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.560
 and other seed related parts such as nuts.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.620
 - Yeah, would you say that the nuts and the seeds

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.380
 and the legumes you're not incorporating

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.460
 because of the PFAS?

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.140
 - Not just that but plants put, they create a storage form

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:08.740
 of nutrients to support the embryos development

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.140
 and those nutrients have to be in insoluble form

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.140
 so they don't wash away while the seed is waiting

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.260
 to germinate.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.800
 They have to be mobilized in an organized way.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.880
 And those preparations for the nutrients

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.480
 for the seed embryo go with specific defenses

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.480
 against those same nutrients being used by predators

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:55.480
 such as mammals that would eat their seeds

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:02.080
 or worms, insects, fungus and so on.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.660
 So they have essentially pesticides or insecticides

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.240
 incorporated into the seed chemistry.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.240
 They put their most special blockers of digestion

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.760
 and basically neurotoxins and digestive toxins

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.760
 into the seed as self defense because the seed

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.080
 is the essential most important part of the plant.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.480
 The plant can grow new leaves if a predator eats them

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.480
 but the seed is the long term existence of the plant.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:47.200
 So the worst toxins as far as animals are concerned

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.040
 are in the seeds.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.760
 - They gotta protect their babies.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.560
 - Yeah.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.800
 - So can you expand a little bit on PFAS?

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.800
 So beyond nuts and seeds, just how you view PFAS

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.040
 influence cells and how they can cause insulin resistance?

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.960
 - Yeah, cold organisms have to, besides surviving the winter

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:24.000
 which cold storage is very good for a seed to survive

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.840
 and insects and fish and other cold blood organisms,

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.880
 frogs for example, can stand to be even frozen

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:46.000
 but they can live daily life at a very low temperature

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.320
 close to freezing.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.120
 And so those organisms are seed when it is ready

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.240
 to germinate in the spring for example

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.960
 when it's still very cold in the northern climate.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.200
 They have to mobilize their enzymes.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.200
 There has to be mobility in the seed cells

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:18.320
 and a fish or an insect naturally has to move

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.320
 even when it's very cold.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.160
 And saturated fats harden at a very moderate temperature.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.400
 If you put butter in the icebox it becomes very hard.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.280
 Even olive oil solidifies in the refrigerator.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:47.520
 And so an animal or a plant living in the north

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.720
 at a low temperature simply can't survive

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.880
 if it has saturated fats for its energy storage.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.880
 And so in proportion to the coldness of the climate

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.000
 they remove hydrogens from the fats

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.160
 making them liquid at cold temperature.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:18.480
 But the degree of unsaturation or removal of hydrogens

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:25.280
 to make them liquid oils in the cold

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.880
 makes them highly oxidizable.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:36.640
 And if you increase the temperature of a fish for example

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:44.480
 at human temperature 98 degrees a fish very quickly stinks.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:52.640
 And if you put highly unsaturated seed oil or fish oil

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.640
 if you raise it to even room temperature

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:08.080
 or body temperature in the 90 degrees Fahrenheit range

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.840
 they will quickly start to harden.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.840
 The oxidation spreads and hardens them into solid masses.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:24.480
 So if an organism is going to live outside

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:31.200
 of that cold environment they have to get rid

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.680
 of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.680
 And the warmer the environment is the more saturated

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.840
 their fat has to be to survive

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.840
 because the highly unsaturated fats simply turn

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:56.840
 to glue plastic like material

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:03.840
 that is totally incompatible with life.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.840
 - So what does that do for metabolism?

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.240
 Like what part of the cellular metabolism

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.040
 does do PUFAs interfere with?

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.520
 Like for example along the electron transport chain?

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.520
 - As soon, when a person eats a seed oil for example

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:27.520
 the first thing a highly unsaturated seed oil does

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.520
 if an animal chews up a flax seed for example

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:39.640
 the polyunsaturated fat blocks the digestion

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:44.640
 of proteolytic enzymes.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.960
 And so it impairs protein digestion

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.840
 as the very first step in your stomach and intestine.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.120
 And then when it gets into the blood

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.040
 if it reaches your thyroid gland

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.080
 it inhibits the proteolytic enzyme

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.800
 which is needed to form thyroid hormone.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.240
 And then circulating in the blood

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.520
 if you ate enough that there's a measurable amount

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.840
 circulating it keeps the thyroid hormones

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.240
 from being transported on the blood proteins.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.880
 And when it gets into the cells

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.880
 it blocks the action of thyroid to stimulate respiration.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.160
 And so the polyunsaturated fat inhibits respiration

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.560
 blocks the energy production

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.560
 and at the same time is starting to degrade

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.600
 and produce the reactive oxidative fragments

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.400
 that are toxic to cells.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:13:00.400
 The circulating polyunsaturated fatty acids in the blood

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.400
 happen to intensify estrogen actions.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:12.400
 It releases estrogen from binding proteins

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:18.960
 making it more active and activates the estrogen receptors

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.120
 and it imitates the actions of estrogen.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:29.120
 So they are systematically impairing estrogen

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.680
 impairing the metabolism and shifting the direction

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.960
 of animal metabolism.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:42.960
 Part of that is the plant's defensive reaction.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:49.080
 The rest of it is just in the nature of energy production

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:55.920
 and the fact that these random oxidative reactions

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.120
 are the opposite of what we need to produce energy.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:07.080
 - From my understanding PUFAs cause our fat cells

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:12.080
 to become insulin sensitive and that's not what we want.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.320
 We want our fat cells to become insulin resistant.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:23.120
 - Yeah, that's just one of the...

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.360
 - Yeah, you listed off the many consequences.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.240
 Some people have questioned where is the role

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.240
 of monounsaturated fats in the diet then?

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.520
 So something like olive oil or avocado.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.360
 How does that compare to the PUFAs versus

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.240
 the saturated fats that you often recommend

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.740
 such as coconut oil or animal fats?

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:47.400
 - When we eat carbohydrates in excess

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.160
 we make our own saturated fats.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.120
 If we are free of the polyunsaturated fats

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.400
 we can modify a certain percentage of our saturated fats

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.400
 which we have made from carbohydrates

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:12.400
 or saturated fat from chocolate or beef for example.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.600
 We can unsaturate midway down the fatty acid molecule

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.960
 at carbon number nine.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.840
 We can start a desaturation process there.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.320
 It's nine carbons away from the end

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.320
 and it's closer to the acidic head end of the fat molecule.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:44.200
 So the acid end makes it safer from oxidation.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.680
 So the ones we produce from saturated fats

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.160
 or carbohydrates are called

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.160
 the omega minus nine series fatty acids

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.040
 and those happen to be anti-inflammatory

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.040
 and are protective against the plant derived

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:15.440
 omega minus three or omega minus six fatty acids.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.400
 - So are you saying that the omega nines,

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.160
 that's oleic acid, is that right?

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:27.080
 - Yeah, that's the major fat I think in avocados.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.080
 It's a major fat and in olive oil for example.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.040
 - So did you say that the omega nines

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.320
 that we get from avocado or olive oil,

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.400
 those are protective against omega sixes and omega threes

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.720
 or only the omega nines that we produce in our bodies?

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:53.520
 - The ones we produce in our bodies independently

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:59.120
 are purely protective and anti-inflammatory.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.520
 The trouble with those, olive oil even,

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:09.920
 usually contains about 10% of the PUFA

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.160
 and if you eat more than maybe one or two teaspoons

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:20.920
 of olive oil per day, you're at risk of accumulating

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:26.800
 that 10% of the highly unsaturated,

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.840
 which will build up gradually over time

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.520
 and offset the protective effect of the omega nine.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.120
 But if your calorie intake is fairly low

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.760
 and you don't overeat on olive oil,

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:48.400
 then those will be disposed of safely

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.400
 and the omega nines can then be protective.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.320
 - I think that that's a really important point

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.600
 that not many people talk about

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.520
 is there are different situations

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.040
 depending on whether you are eating in a caloric deficit

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.640
 or eating in a caloric surplus.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.280
 It's almost like caloric surpluses

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.280
 can amplify some of these negative consequences.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.000
 - What can amplify them?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.840
 - Eating in a caloric surplus,

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.400
 so eating more calories than what you are burning.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.280
 - Yeah, eating excess calories.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:27.280
 These go into storage and build up over time,

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.800
 remarkably medical literature, not so much the scientific,

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:38.360
 but a baby,

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:44.360
 now people are saying almost all newborn babies

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:49.480
 are deficient in the so-called essential fatty acids.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:55.680
 In fact, the newborn babies oxidative metabolism

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.840
 and ability to produce energy quickly

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.360
 and to build tissue,

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.160
 it's at an extremely high rate,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.160
 much higher than ever again in life,

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.800
 the first few months of a baby's life.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.800
 It's consuming oxygen at an extremely high rate

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.320
 per unit of tissue

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.560
 and that's exactly because of the absence

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.280
 of the polyunsaturated fats

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.920
 and if it eats a so-called formula

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:41.920
 containing the so-called essential fatty acids,

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.640
 it very quickly starts to suppress

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.640
 its cellular metabolism using oxygen.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:57.880
 The accumulation of polyunsaturated fats

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.400
 goes on steadily from,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.480
 as soon as it's exposed to them,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:10.480
 especially with a synthetic formula containing PUFA,

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.680
 that goes on steadily

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.680
 and slows the metabolic rate progressively.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:25.000
 If you look at a chart

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.080
 graphing the consumption of oxygen per tissue,

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:34.400
 it's at a very high point at the beginning

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.440
 and an extremely low point

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.440
 at reaching zero at old age and death.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.360
 So it's a progressive aging process

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:51.200
 and energy losing process of the tissue

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.400
 exactly in proportion to the accumulation

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.400
 of polyunsaturated fats with time.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.760
 - Thinking of the way that we grew up

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.240
 and the way that we ate growing up,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.640
 I can't even imagine how many PUFAs we've accumulated

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.480
 throughout the years.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.960
 One of the essential foods

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.960
 or the foods that you would recommend

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.680
 for somebody to consume, you mentioned fish.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.560
 So were you talking about like white fish

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.080
 or do you have any role in your diet

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.800
 for fish that are high in the essential fatty acids

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.160
 such as something like salmon or salmon roe?

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.560
 So maybe cold water versus warm water fish as well.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.040
 - Salmon is terrible

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:37.040
 because of its high content of polyunsaturated fats.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:42.240
 The desirable ones, if you can't eat tropical fish,

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:47.080
 like in the Amazon River where the water is very warm,

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:52.160
 fish fat is just about as saturated as butter fat.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.480
 So it's much safer,

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.480
 but in the cold water fish,

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:06.400
 you can select those with a very low body fat content.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:13.000
 And so cod and sole, for example,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.120
 are much better than salmon.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.360
 - So I know a lot of people question then

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.360
 like how did the Inuits get by

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.000
 with very little health problems

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.240
 when they were eating a diet high in cold water fish?

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.800
 Do you have any insight on this point?

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:37.680
 - It's a very harmful diet.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.960
 If you have a high metabolic rate

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.960
 and are able to oxidize the fats as fast as you eat them,

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:53.720
 they won't accumulate at a dangerous rate.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.160
 But if you're fairly sedentary

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:02.160
 and are intending to add a little fat every day,

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:09.520
 you're going to run into all of the accumulated

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:15.040
 pro-inflammatory oxidative conditions

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:22.280
 with time and the accumulation of these in your tissues.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.360
 There are many people claiming that since the brain contains

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:35.560
 a high level of the omega minus three polyunsaturated fats,

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:43.080
 that they are necessary for the brain.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.560
 Somehow the baby at birth doesn't contain them.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:53.960
 And supposedly, if they're necessary for the brain,

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.240
 the baby would develop a fully normal,

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:04.240
 extremely functional brain without them.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:10.640
 And in fact, if you look at the brain in dementia,

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:16.720
 these polyunsaturated fats are accumulating

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:21.280
 in a form bound to cholesterol.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.680
 So that in proportion to dementia,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:31.800
 the brain contains the omega minus three fatty acids.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:40.680
 The whole story to promote their sale of fish oil

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.160
 is basically cricket.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.840
 It's advertising without science

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.320
 or with the reverse upside down science.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.320
 They are immunosuppressive.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.840
 They knock out your white blood cell function.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:04.400
 And the oxidative breakdown products

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.720
 are what is causing the damage.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.760
 And that suppression of the immune system,

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.440
 if you're killing your white blood cells

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.280
 during several months period,

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:26.280
 they can have an anti-inflammatory function.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.360
 But eventually you're going to want to have

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.320
 some living white blood cells,

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.960
 even at the expense of having inflammation.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.240
 And the long range effect

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.480
 is that you've weakened your immune system.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:48.480
 And it happens that the oxidative breakdown products

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:56.080
 are supportive to the formation of antibodies,

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.840
 but not to the function of thymus cells

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.840
 and the other necessary components of the immune system.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.920
 And it happens that estrogen excess

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.480
 biases the immune system in the same way,

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:21.040
 leading towards emphasis on antibodies,

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.520
 but not on the basic white blood cell

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.560
 based part of the immune system.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.560
 - Interesting.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.600
 So to be honest, like a few years ago,

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.600
 we certainly thought that these were essential fatty acids.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.840
 Do you have any resources that you would suggest

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.920
 someone to read through to kind of maybe get them thinking

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.160
 that maybe these aren't essential fatty acids?

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.160
 There's been so much propaganda for the benefits of these

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.960
 and that we need to consume them in a diet.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.280
 What resources would you point people to

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.440
 to show that, hey, there's actually potential downsides

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.360
 to consuming these?

00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:00.360
 - Someone recently sent me their draft

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:05.480
 of an extremely good, very readable book

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.320
 on the polyunsaturated fats.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:16.240
 And it has, I think, a thousand references,

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.240
 so it can function as a textbook,

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.440
 but it's also just entertaining and readable.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.360
 And it's going to be published imminently,

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.600
 but it isn't available right now.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:36.600
 And I can tell you later where to find it.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.920
 I don't have the information right now.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.280
 - Okay, you'll have to send it,

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.120
 or we'll come back and talk about that.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.080
 - Yeah, so stay tuned.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.600
 That book will be coming soon.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.920
 - Okay, so moving on to a slightly controversial topic

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.480
 in the keto and carnivore community.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.360
 Can you make the case for sugar?

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.520
 So not saying that sugar is going to provide you

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.160
 with a ton of nutrients,

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.960
 but what role do you see sugar playing in someone's diet?

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:14.720
 - If you have a highly digestible starch,

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.280
 it quickly breaks down into glucose,

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:25.280
 and then it can provide very safe energy

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:31.160
 and can make saturated fats as needed.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:37.320
 But many starches are hard to digest,

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:42.320
 and for someone with sluggish digestion,

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.880
 starches tend to support bacterial overgrowth

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.880
 in the intestine.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.800
 So a person has to take into account

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.760
 the quality of their digestion

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.040
 when they're considering what to eat.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.800
 So vegetables are fine

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.320
 when your digestive system is working well.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:12.520
 But if you have digestive limitations

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.520
 and a tendency to bacterial overgrowth

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.520
 or slow peristalsis or nocturnal reflux,

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:27.640
 lots of the common symptoms are made worse by starches.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.800
 And in that case, a low-starch fruit,

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.960
 such as the citrus fruit,

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:40.240
 can be a perfect source of carbohydrates.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.840
 And you need some kind of carbohydrate

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:49.840
 to safely metabolize fats and proteins.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:59.920
 And any cooked vegetable will work for most people,

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:05.080
 but some people have to be very selective

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:12.920
 and pick out certain vegetables

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:18.240
 that they're sure are going to produce inflammation

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.280
 and bacterial overgrowth.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.640
 - So to summarize, basically,

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:27.640
 you're kind of saying that sugar is just easy, fast energy,

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.880
 and so it doesn't cause negative effects of,

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.600
 for example, digestion problems

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.640
 that maybe it would cause

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.880
 if someone had to break down,

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.720
 like what's an example, like sweet potato.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.880
 Some people may have a problem breaking that sweet potato

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.400
 or other vegetables to get their energy.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.160
 And so sugar can play a role

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.200
 in just providing fast energy

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.680
 that can access the cells quickly.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.640
 Is that right?

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.480
 - Yeah, and it doesn't require digestion,

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.360
 so it can start absorbing right in your stomach

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.320
 and immediately in your upper intestine.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:08.320
 And even if you have a perfectly digestible starch,

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:14.040
 the starch has the same quick reaction

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:18.000
 that pure glucose does,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.680
 and so it's a powerful stimulant to insulin.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:27.080
 And so if you eat a little too much glucose or starch,

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.320
 it activates insulin secretion

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:35.320
 and will turn the excess sugar into fat.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.000
 And the insulin can then,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.120
 if you have other nutritional limitations,

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:51.320
 the sudden surge of insulin from glucose or starch,

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.480
 after turning on fat production,

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.320
 it lowers your blood sugar,

00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.280
 and that can cause stress reactions.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.880
 And the difference between sucrose,

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.600
 the common sugar in fruits,

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.280
 is that it's only 50% glucose,

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:14.080
 so it doesn't have the isomeric reaction

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.040
 that a digestible starch has.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:22.040
 It's only half as able to stimulate insulin

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.320
 because it's only half glucose.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.480
 And then the fructose component of the molecule

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:34.480
 actually has a mild insulin inhibiting effect.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:40.120
 So it provides the sugar energy

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:44.440
 much more gradually than starch does.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:50.760
 And it tends to avoid the glucose,

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:59.080
 insulin, hypoglycemia stress reaction

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:04.080
 that a highly digestible starch doesn't cause.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.680
 - So a lot of the anti-fructose arguments

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.840
 bring up the point that fructose consumption

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.640
 doesn't spike insulin,

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.560
 and so therefore you should stay below a certain threshold

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.520
 or else it will automatically lead to fat gain, for example.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:25.000
 So where are a lot of these anti-fructose arguments

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.840
 coming from?

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.280
 Is it some relation to PUFAs?

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.400
 Where is that argument

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.600
 of it automatically leads to fat storage?

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:37.240
 - Naturally, if you overeat on fat,

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:42.240
 or protein, or starch, or sucrose,

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.120
 you're gonna get fat.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.360
 (laughing)

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:52.280
 The anti-sugar argument really started back in the '50s.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.760
 And they were having the idea

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:12.760
 of overeating sugar would stimulate

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:18.720
 first hypoglycemia and then adrenaline.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:25.160
 All of the typical hypoglycemia arguments

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:31.160
 which simply are making extreme conclusions

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:37.280
 from a few experiments.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.760
 But when you have sucrose with a mixed diet,

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.160
 it's actually a stabilizing effect

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.880
 rather than a destabilizing effect,

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.000
 which the early arguments were making.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 But then an English doctor, John Yitken,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.720
 wrote a book and said,

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.720
 "Wait, sugar, if you eat an excess of sugar,

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.280
 "it turns to saturated fat."

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:12.280
 And the anti-cholesterol, anti-fat argument

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:17.880
 that was promoted to sell vegetable oil

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.440
 had sold the idea of saturated fat

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.200
 as the cause of heart disease.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.840
 And John Yitken said,

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.520
 "Wait, sugar causes saturated fat to rise,

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.680
 "and so sugar is the cause of heart disease."

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.960
 So he had a doubly wrong argument.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:45.960
 But that book was very popular starting in the 1970s,

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:51.800
 and persisted, and then I think it was largely,

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:56.440
 I think his name is Robert Lustig,

00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:01.440
 a professor of pediatrics in San Francisco,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:09.120
 made some even stranger arguments,

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.240
 saying that fructose is like,

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.160
 it's as toxic as alcohol.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 And that he, in his famous video,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.720
 showed a lot of references

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.120
 on the blue screen in the background.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.440
 And I looked up some of his references,

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.320
 and once I looked up,

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.320
 it didn't support his argument at all.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:43.880
 In fact, fructose is a very powerful,

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:48.880
 specific antidote to ethanol poisoning.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.120
 Absolutely to reverse what he says.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.600
 And the reason is,

00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:00.680
 ethanol, like a high-fat diet,

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:05.760
 shifts the electronic balance

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.720
 of the cell metabolism

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:13.720
 in the direction of too many electrons,

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.360
 a reducing state.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:21.360
 It's an antidote to fat metabolism poisoning,

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.640
 and starvation.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:33.760
 The extreme of the ketogenic principle,

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.760
 when you form ketone bodies,

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:43.200
 by starving yourself for sugar,

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:49.200
 you're mobilizing fat metabolism,

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.640
 and putting yourself in a high-reducing state.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:59.000
 The opposite of what fructose does to the cell.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.520
 - That is a very interesting argument

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.760
 that our audience will not like,

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.280
 but we like to challenge our views

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.360
 and challenge everyone's views.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.440
 So, appreciate you sharing.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.520
 Now we have a follow-up on the sugar.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:19.000
 - Yeah, so considering we came from a keto

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.600
 and then carnivore, zero-carb diet,

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.000
 what is the best way for somebody

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.160
 to start incorporating sugar

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.080
 after they have starved for their bodies from it

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.600
 for quite some time?

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.720
 - Or carbs, yeah.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:42.400
 I don't think it's a matter of having

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.400
 to work gradually into it.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:50.600
 A dose of sugar, as long as it isn't grossly excessive,

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:59.360
 will be the first best antidote to the poisoning

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.640
 that you have been experiencing.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:10.360
 In an extreme state of the reducing diet

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:15.360
 or the starvation condition,

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:22.080
 the ketones derived from outside your body

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:27.080
 are actually a good, safe energy source.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:34.040
 So if you get ketones from fruits and vegetables,

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:39.320
 those are just like sugar,

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.960
 they're protective and start the repair process

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:48.200
 of lowering the stress hormones,

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:53.200
 getting you out of the reducing stress condition,

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:57.920
 starting up the cellular oxidation again.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:04.120
 And either the ketones from the outside,

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:09.520
 found in vegetables and fruits or sugars,

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.040
 are the essential thing

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:15.600
 for getting your oxidative metabolism going again.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.960
 - So what do you say to someone who says,

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.960
 well, in the past, like our ancestors,

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.120
 they didn't have access to carbohydrates,

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.160
 and so they were certainly fat-fueled,

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.840
 like they relied on animal meat and animal fats.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:37.040
 - Well, if you look at primates,

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:43.600
 fruits, it happens that the longest-lived

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:50.400
 in proportion to body size primate is the squirrel monkey.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:58.960
 They have a pure fruit diet,

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:05.760
 and they're the size of a squirrel,

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:10.480
 but they live an average of 30 years,

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:15.840
 which for their body sizes is a very long time.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.840
 And brain development is in proportion

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:26.040
 to the amount of sugar that can be provided

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.200
 to the developing nerve tissue.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:35.200
 It requires sugar energy.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:42.560
 It's a very high oxidizing tissue,

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.320
 and that oxidation has to be based

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.280
 on sugar, on glucose specifically.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.360
 And to develop a brain,

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.840
 the primates have to have a relatively high

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.000
 carbohydrate diet.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 Chimpanzees don't get as much carbohydrate

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.400
 as the fruit-eating monkeys,

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.840
 and for their body size,

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:18.840
 they aren't especially either long-lived or intelligent.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.080
 The squirrel monkey has a huge brain

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.160
 in proportion to its body size.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:31.960
 Chimpanzees and gorillas have relatively small brains.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.720
 - So someone would then make the argument

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:40.760
 that homo sapiens are quite different than chimpanzees.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:44.680
 So for example, vitamin B12 in the gut digestive tract,

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.440
 so just example of some of the differences.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.480
 So someone could argue that we are

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.000
 drastically different from them.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:56.080
 And so is there any evidence from our early lineage

00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:01.080
 that carbohydrates were beneficial as opposed to ketosis?

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:11.240
 - There is fossil evidence

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.000
 that the isotopes can be interpreted

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.800
 to show the importance of carbohydrate

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.400
 in brain development.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.680
 For example, one of the African

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:30.400
 precursors of homo sapiens

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:36.720
 lived on a type of giant grass,

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.400
 sort of like sugar cane.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:43.040
 They had specially developed molars

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.240
 for mashing the sugary juice

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:52.240
 out of this reed along the Nile River.

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.240
 And they had very well-developed brains.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:02.880
 So many of the arguments are extremely ideological.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:14.120
 They have an idea of what they think

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.840
 human beings should be.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:20.040
 And so they have shaped their evidence

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.520
 basically to fit the argument.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.720
 - And I've heard you say many times

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.920
 that our environment right now is very different

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:32.040
 than environment of early homo sapiens,

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.520
 where we face a lot more stress from, for example,

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:38.800
 like 5G and other sorts of life stresses

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.520
 like pollution, et cetera.

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.880
 So I think that that's something to think about

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:43.840
 for the audience as well,

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.680
 is like potentially our needs as human species now

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.200
 is different than it was X years ago.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.720
 Is that true of what you kind of believe?

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:59.240
 - Yeah, in just the last 50 years

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.000
 in the United States in particular,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.680
 but all around the Northern Hemisphere,

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:10.760
 conditions have radically changed.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:14.080
 For example, in 1963,

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:20.120
 there was a competitive hydrogen bomb testing spree

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:27.720
 in both Soviet Union and the United States

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.720
 that loaded the whole atmosphere of the Northern Hemisphere

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.960
 with immense amounts of radioactive isotopes.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.280
 So starting in 1963,

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:48.400
 babies were exposed

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:53.400
 to brain damaging amounts of radiation

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.160
 concentrated in the uterus

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:00.440
 and affecting brain development.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:06.360
 And roughly in the same generation,

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:12.040
 the vaccination mania was instituted,

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.880
 especially in the United States,

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.520
 rising to a horrible peak

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:24.520
 of something like 60 vaccinations per child

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:30.000
 in recent decades.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.560
 So these terrible environmental influences

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.440
 have become universal

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.880
 and have to be taken into account.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.400
 And radiation damage, for example,

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:52.240
 is amplified by polyunsaturated fats

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.480
 and by estrogens.

00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:01.360
 In fact, estrogen and polyunsaturated fats

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:05.160
 synergize in tissue damage

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.960
 with ionizing radiation.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:12.240
 Their effects are essentially similar

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:18.000
 and overlapping and synergistic.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.240
 - So there's just some things

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:24.120
 we cannot control in our environment,

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.800
 but we can control our diet.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.880
 So I just have one more follow-up question

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.680
 on the sugar and the carbs.

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.320
 What would you say to somebody

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.800
 who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes?

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.040
 'Cause I know that you definitely do prefer

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.360
 our main fuel source, tuby carbs,

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.160
 but so many people seem to be going

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.520
 to a low-carb diet to manage these conditions.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:52.000
 - The first thing to consider is

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.520
 what do they mean that they have type 1

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.640
 or type 2 diabetes?

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.080
 For 50 years or more,

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:04.080
 I've been talking to people who've had that diagnosis

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.920
 and I asked them how it was diagnosed.

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:13.280
 You, in principle, can't diagnose type 1

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:17.560
 without actually doing a blood test for insulin.

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:23.920
 But out of hundreds of people I've talked to,

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.640
 only half a dozen or so actually had their insulin measured,

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:35.640
 but they were immediately treated for diabetes

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:40.320
 without a rational diagnosis.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:44.720
 For cancer or diabetes or anything,

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:51.400
 first step is to understand what was meant.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:58.960
 Was the blood glucose the basis for the diagnosis?

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:05.120
 In kids, that's often all that's measured.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:11.520
 The most common cause for high glucose

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:16.520
 is stress causing unopposed cortisol secretion.

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:23.200
 So if you don't measure for either insulin or cortisol,

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:27.320
 you might be doing exactly the wrong treatment

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:31.240
 to lower cortisol.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:35.160
 Sugar is the most powerful treatment.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:41.960
 And two doctors in France and England

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.560
 in the late 19th century

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:50.600
 were curing terminal diabetic patients

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:57.080
 that they would eat a normal meal,

00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:00.240
 lots of protein, for example,

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.480
 but their muscles were wasting away

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.520
 even when they didn't eat sugar.

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:10.800
 They would eat steak, for example.

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:15.800
 It would show up in their urine as very high glucose

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:22.200
 and their body was disappearing week by week

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:27.920
 but when they fed them 12 ounces a day

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.920
 of ordinary white sugar

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:35.920
 as well as a standard meat and potatoes diet,

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.160
 they recovered.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.280
 - Wow.

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.720
 I heard Matt Blackburn talking about these studies

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:45.040
 and how they were removed from scientific literature,

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.480
 like access to them,

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:50.240
 but he said he just bought a book on Amazon

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.440
 from the British literature of medicine,

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:55.520
 I don't know, some year, 1860 something,

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.960
 and he now has access to those studies.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.640
 So it'll be interesting for him to post those.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.520
 So you have seen those studies?

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:08.000
 - So I haven't seen that book.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:08.840
 - Okay.

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.640
 But it's interesting

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.280
 'cause that's just not talked about anymore.

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.720
 So I think it's an interesting perspective

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.200
 that maybe someone should consider.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.280
 But moving on to the final nutrition question that we have,

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.200
 and this was a very popular question from our audience.

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.280
 So Dr. Peat, let's say that you were about 50

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:30.240
 or 60 pounds overweight,

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.680
 what would you do to lose weight?

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:37.240
 - First, stop eating for a while

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:43.640
 and then go on a low-fat milk and cheese diet

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.360
 with a little bit of orange juice

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:52.520
 and an occasional egg and oyster.

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:58.440
 Calcium and vitamin D

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:04.240
 are supportive of the thyroid hormone.

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:10.280
 It's good to check your thyroid hormone and vitamin D

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:13.320
 if you're at all overweight

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:18.320
 because a deficiency of those is extremely common

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.680
 and slows the metabolism.

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:28.880
 A high PUFA intake will suppress your vitamin D metabolism

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.720
 as well as your thyroid metabolism.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.520
 So making sure those are good.

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:40.520
 And you want to lower the phosphate in your diet

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.360
 relative to calcium.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:48.320
 And so milk and cheese as a staple of your diet

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:53.320
 will tremendously increase your heat production

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:58.080
 and energy metabolism, oxygen consumption,

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:03.040
 and make it much easier to lose weight.

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:08.040
 And then the foods, moderate amounts of egg,

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.800
 shellfish such as oysters,

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:16.800
 and some orange juice will provide essential nutrients

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:21.960
 and anti-inflammatory things

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:26.800
 that support your background metabolism.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.400
 - I think that's great.

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:31.280
 That's like the first time I've heard somebody

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.560
 describe a weight loss diet

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:37.000
 that isn't purely focused on calories,

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.800
 but instead focused on still getting

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:42.680
 the necessary nutrients that your organs need

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.280
 to function optimally.

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:47.760
 But would you still say that calories still do matter?

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.280
 He said, yeah, like so eat less.

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:54.520
 - Yeah, but the difference is that

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:57.240
 a person who has been dieting

00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.920
 very often will be burning calories

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:05.920
 at a rate of seven or 800 calories per day.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:10.960
 And so they get fat on just a few snacks.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:14.440
 But when you shift over,

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.760
 making sure your vitamin D and thyroid are okay,

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.240
 but shift over to a high calcium to phosphate ratio

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:27.240
 in your diet, not much meat, not much ordinary fish,

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:35.320
 but enough shellfish for the trace minerals.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:38.120
 The high calcium phosphate ratio

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:43.960
 and high protein relative to fat

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:50.280
 with the rest of it carbohydrate enough

00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:52.840
 so that you handle the protein

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.240
 and fat metabolism without stress.

00:54:55.240 --> 00:55:01.160
 That will very quickly increase your calorie consumption

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:07.280
 from seven or 800 a day up to the normal 2000 per day,

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:14.520
 making it tremendously easier to lose weight.

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:19.480
 And as you stay out of the stress condition,

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.760
 your muscles are going to recover.

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.720
 You'll put on weight in the form of muscle

00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:32.040
 as part of your ability to burn 1000 or 1500 calories

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.080
 per day.

00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:39.160
 So your muscles are then going to take over

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:43.040
 to continuing weight regulation.

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:48.720
 - So in terms of increasing the metabolic rate,

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.680
 can we cover potentially some supplements

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.760
 that would be able to help that?

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:56.240
 What supplements do you think are beneficial

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.840
 that we still can get in foods,

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:02.360
 but we may benefit from having more, supplementing more?

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:08.480
 - You get all of your trace minerals from the seafoods,

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.240
 especially shellfish.

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:17.160
 And if eggs and milk aren't producing enough vitamins,

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:25.800
 you can occasionally add a little bit of liver

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:30.400
 into your diet, which will have both trace minerals

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.760
 and vitamins in abundance.

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:37.000
 So liver and oysters,

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.160
 you can think of them as your supplements.

00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:44.920
 Have one serving of those per week.

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:49.920
 And it's much better than a hundred hours a month

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:55.040
 spent on supplements and much safer

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:58.640
 because there is no supplement on the market

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:03.120
 that isn't contaminated with manufacturing debris,

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:08.360
 basically stuff that can't be kept out

00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.840
 of the chemical processes.

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:16.680
 - So you emphasized vitamin D earlier in this conversation.

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:20.040
 So what about somebody who maybe in their winter months

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.520
 can't get as much sun?

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:24.560
 Would you still advise against supplementing with vitamin D?

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:30.400
 - Yeah, but only in a proper safe vehicle.

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:38.680
 It's available in pure olive oil,

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:42.120
 sulfate capsules and drops both.

00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.960
 - One other question about supplements.

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.480
 I know you recommend aspirin a lot,

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:49.480
 and I know there's a lot of information out there

00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:51.320
 on how you feel about aspirin.

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:54.160
 Could you just clarify who you think

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.800
 should be taking aspirin,

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.960
 if it's for everybody or a certain condition?

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:04.680
 - Everyone, even on a good diet,

00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.040
 milk for example,

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:13.240
 1% milk has still a small amount of PUFA.

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:18.760
 3% of the fat roughly is highly unsaturated.

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:23.120
 And we're all tending at different rates

00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:27.200
 to accumulate polyunsaturated fats in our tissues.

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:33.200
 And so with aging, aspirin becomes a defensive material.

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:43.160
 Since we have the PUFA in our tissues,

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:48.160
 any little stress is going to lead it to break down

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:52.040
 into these inflammatory things such as prostaglandins.

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:58.360
 And so in proportion to your tissue load,

00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.240
 which varies with your diet and age,

00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.920
 aspirin can be very protective.

00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:09.920
 Vitamin E has similar anti-inflammatory aspirin-like actions.

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:14.640
 - Okay, yeah, we just added in some vitamin E

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.120
 to protect against some of these things.

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:18.280
 - I haven't done the aspirin yet.

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.480
 - Yeah.

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:21.080
 - So when you do the aspirin,

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.680
 you just take like one pill a day,

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:26.520
 or is it a certain dose per week that you would recommend?

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:33.440
 - I think once a person is over 50 or 60,

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:39.560
 a standard pill per day is fine

00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:44.560
 as long as they are sure to keep their vitamin K level up.

00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:49.400
 If your vitamin K level is low,

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:54.400
 you'll bleed very easily and aspirin will intensify that.

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:58.280
 But if you have a good vitamin K intake

00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:03.280
 from liver and aged cheese, for example,

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:09.040
 then the aspirin is not going to increase

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.920
 your bleeding risk.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.440
 - Okay, that's an important note.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.280
 So we kind of wanted to dive in a little bit more

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.080
 about some underlying questions we still have

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.040
 about female hormones in fertility,

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.200
 because I know you put so much work into this topic,

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.560
 which I think is just incredible.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.920
 So first question,

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.800
 it kind of goes along the lines of our journey.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.280
 What is your opinion on a low carb diet

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.760
 or fasting for female hormones?

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.240
 - For what?

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.440
 - For female hormones,

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:44.360
 like the implications that following a prolonged low carb diet

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.960
 or doing prolonged fasts could have

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.920
 on female hormones in fertility.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.560
 - Very harmful.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:01:00.040
 Fasting increases your free fatty acids going too long

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:06.800
 without food.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.360
 And if you're in very good health,

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:14.280
 you can stand at least eight hours without stress.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:18.880
 But the lower your reserves are,

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:26.560
 more often you should replenish your carbohydrates.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:32.000
 Going for a long time without carbohydrates

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.400
 or total fasting,

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:39.400
 your free fatty acids will increase in your blood.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.160
 And the presence of free fatty acids,

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:50.120
 as the glucose decreases,

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:54.440
 the balance of free fatty acid

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:59.200
 turns off the ability to oxidize glucose,

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:05.280
 blocks the ability to process pyruvic acid.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:10.280
 to process pyruvic acid

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:14.920
 to carbon dioxide production.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.000
 And instead of turning the carbon dioxide,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
 the pyruvic acid turns into lactic acid.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.840
 And the lactic acid is responsible

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.520
 for shifting the electron balance of the whole system.

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.480
 So once your blood balance

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.880
 between free fatty acids and glucose

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.760
 reaches a dominance of fat,

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:50.080
 your lactic acid level automatically goes up

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.640
 and that shifts your whole body

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:58.640
 into the stress, reducing stress condition.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:03.800
 And that means that you have an instantly diabetic

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:08.680
 or cancer-like metabolism.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:15.480
 Diabetes metabolism is just a way

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.520
 of describing the long range effect

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:24.360
 of not enough sugar being metabolized

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:29.360
 because we mobilize fat in proportion

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.000
 to a loss of glucose.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.080
 Mobilizing fat blocks the use of pyruvic acid,

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:43.680
 therefore increases lactic acid.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:47.960
 Lactic acid turns on that whole system

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.400
 known as the cancer metabolism

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:55.000
 or the diabetes metabolism or the inflammatory metabolism.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:02.920
 All of those conditions are really instantaneous expressions

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:06.280
 of the absence of glucose.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:09.320
 And when they become a disease,

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:13.680
 it's because that process has been continued too long.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:19.800
 - So it's hard to deny some of the success stories

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:23.840
 that you have heard from some people coming from,

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.480
 I don't know if it was more of a carb-based

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.360
 or just more standard American diet

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.120
 that was higher in PUFA.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.440
 A lot of people have,

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.520
 some women have regained their period

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.480
 and have lost weight and have felt better

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:41.120
 by going to a lower carb or zero carb diet.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.880
 Can you explain potentially what would happen?

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.840
 - What that usually means,

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:53.160
 they'll sometimes cure insomnia or epilepsy

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.480
 or lots of things.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.040
 Now what it usually means

01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:01.480
 is they've been eating the standard Western diet,

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:07.600
 bread, legumes, processed foods,

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:14.240
 of various starchy and oily composition.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:19.200
 And very often they'll increase their consumption

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.200
 of meat and fish and eggs and cheese, for example.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:31.560
 They see it as a decrease of carbohydrate,

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:36.560
 but what it usually amounts to in the United States

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:41.640
 is a reduction of toxic foods.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.040
 - A reduction of PUFAs

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.600
 and then they're increasing the amount of nutrients

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.560
 they're getting from things like meat and eggs and dairy.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:57.400
 - Yeah, meat and cheese and eggs, for example,

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:02.760
 don't contain inflammatory materials,

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:07.760
 such as the average pasta and bread-containing diet.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:14.640
 - A large reason some people do lose their periods is PCOS.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:18.160
 What do you recommend for somebody with PCOS?

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:22.760
 - Vitamin D and calcium would be the first thing,

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:26.120
 and then checking thyroid function.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.480
 - Okay, so similar to the losing of the weight.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.720
 - Yeah, and vitamin D deficiency

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:37.240
 is now a very commonly recognized cause.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:40.000
 But experimentally, 50 years ago,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.200
 they could produce it in animals

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.000
 by making them hypothyroid

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.640
 and giving them a glenadal stimulation

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.320
 to increase their estrogen.

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:59.200
 So the estrogen, if they're low thyroid,

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.520
 they can turn cholesterol into progesterone.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:10.080
 And if they're at the same time stimulated with estrogen,

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:17.560
 the adrenal glands become overactive

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.920
 and start producing the androgens

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:26.880
 and the whole system shifts,

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:31.320
 but increasing the metabolic rate,

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:35.480
 the ability to use oxygen by increasing vitamin D

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.280
 and calcium along with thyroid

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.760
 can break you out of that cycle.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:45.680
 - Cool, so why do you recommend females and also males

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:49.840
 to monitor their temperature and pulse?

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.120
 So what is your goal tracking those?

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.400
 What do those markers say

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.800
 and what should we look for for those values?

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.680
 - If you take your temperature and pulse rate

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.320
 when you first wake up

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.600
 and then sometime later in the day,

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:11.040
 you'll learn many, many things.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:17.000
 A very hypothyroid or nutrient deficient person

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.800
 will have extreme stress hormones during the night,

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.480
 but not enough thyroid hormone and calcium and vitamin D

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:32.480
 to maintain their metabolic rate.

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:35.760
 And so what happens is high cortisol

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:41.720
 will turn your protein, good tissues

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.680
 into the essential glucose that you need.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:49.440
 It's like starvation or a ketogenic diet.

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.760
 The high cortisol takes over

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.760
 to provide the essential amount of glucose.

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:02.800
 And so high cortisol becomes extreme around dawn

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:09.200
 and your waking temperature will be abnormally high

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:14.280
 even though your metabolic rate oxidatively is low.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.320
 And then if you eat breakfast,

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.480
 have some orange juice for example,

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:26.520
 and your pulse slows and your temperature falls,

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.160
 that shows that it was cortisol

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:34.200
 causing the high market temperature.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:40.200
 So a falling pulse with food is an anti-stress sign.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:46.720
 And when you get your night stress hormones down

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:54.280
 by eating a more balanced diet with adequate carbohydrate,

01:09:54.280 --> 01:10:01.320
 then if you have a very low morning temperature

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:06.720
 and you're slow to rise to 98.6 or 37 Celsius,

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.920
 if you don't quickly get up to the functional temperature,

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:21.760
 that's a typical low thyroid sign.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:26.040
 In the absence of extreme night stress,

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:31.040
 your waking temperature might be 95 or 96 degrees Fahrenheit

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:38.400
 or it should be not far below 98 degrees at waking.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.720
 - So it's a good way to measure

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.320
 the functioning of your thyroid.

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:47.920
 - Yeah, and also very often of your cortisol.

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.240
 - Okay, what about somebody who is waking up

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.880
 very frequently throughout the night to go pee?

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.040
 Is that a sign of high cortisol?

01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:02.880
 - Yeah, sometimes just increased calcium and vitamin D

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.720
 will take care of that.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:10.560
 Other times thyroid is responsible.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.800
 - Okay, great.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.440
 So if someone has a lot of thyroid problems,

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:19.920
 do you ever recommend specific thyroid tests

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.280
 or potentially thyroid supplementation?

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:28.720
 - Yeah, the morning temperature and pulse rate check

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.440
 is extremely effective,

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:36.520
 but it's good to have a backup blood test.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:41.920
 Healthy people, I've never seen anyone

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.800
 without some of the hypothyroid signs and symptoms.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.480
 If their TSH was very much above 1.0,

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:58.040
 where the normal range goes all the way up to 4 or 5.0.

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:05.560
 And they say it's abnormal to be below 0.4

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:14.200
 at the low end of the range on the TSH.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:19.200
 But when people have looked at a big population

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:25.480
 and the frequency of thyroid problems,

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:29.400
 such as especially thyroid cancer,

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:35.400
 they found that areas where people

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.880
 have no higher than 0.4,

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:45.600
 where everyone was below normal on their TSH,

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.720
 meaning by the medical definition

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.240
 that they would be hyperthyroid.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:55.320
 Those people were free of thyroid cancer.

01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:01.480
 And what that means is that the chronic cumulative exposure

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:09.360
 of the thyroid gland to the TSH pituitary hormone,

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:14.960
 that is carcinogenic, leads to decomposition,

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:20.040
 formation of nodules in the gland,

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.800
 and ultimately a risk of thyroid cancer.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:30.160
 So it's very good to know what your TSH is,

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.720
 even though the doctor's going to tell you

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:37.720
 it's perfectly normal to have 2 or 3 or 4.0 on the test.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:44.640
 If you also had your cholesterol measured,

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:52.400
 in a large population, the cholesterol rises

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.920
 exactly as TSH rises.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.920
 And so as you improve your diet or supplement thyroid

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:08.600
 to reduce other symptoms, such as ovarian reproductive

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:15.080
 problems, as your TSH goes down,

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:18.800
 your cholesterol approaches normal,

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:23.280
 decreases along with the TSH.

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.600
 - Okay.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.640
 So considering this is all about the thyroid,

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.880
 what would be the number one thing you'd recommend

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.240
 for somebody to start improving the function

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.320
 of their thyroid if that TSH--

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:37.760
 - Cutting out all the unfeterated fats.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.600
 - Right on.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:42.280
 Okay, that seems to be the general theme

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.480
 with your nutrition.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:47.560
 Okay, let's see here.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.640
 One final question about the hormones.

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:54.240
 Should women approach nutrition differently

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.240
 from their fertile years to post-menopausal years?

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:07.560
 - Recognizing that the menopause is reflecting

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:13.600
 primarily a failure in your ability to make progesterone,

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:19.240
 and that that leaves all of the cells of your body

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:23.000
 under increased stress,

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.000
 tending to cause them to begin producing estrogen.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.200
 So menopause is a condition of increased estrogen exposure

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.600
 and symptoms.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:43.600
 And for example, post-menopausal women are the ones

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:48.640
 who are susceptible to sickness from the coronavirus.

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:54.680
 Menstruating women are much, much less likely

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:58.400
 to have any symptoms from the virus.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.800
 - And would you say that's because of progesterone?

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:06.160
 - Progesterone can be supplemented,

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:12.080
 but the important thing is to watch your thyroid function

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:18.080
 and your nutrition, and use your cholesterol levels,

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:24.280
 for example, as one of the indicators

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:29.280
 of what's going on with your progesterone and estrogen.

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.920
 - So if we connect all these dots,

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:35.280
 the best thing you could do for all of this,

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.880
 including coronavirus,

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:40.480
 is to significantly reduce your intake of PUFAS.

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:42.400
 - Oh, yeah.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.760
 - The cholesterol connection is very interesting

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:49.240
 because I have had high cholesterol

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.040
 for quite a long time now, and I also have amenorrhea,

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.200
 and I kind of never made that connection

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:57.320
 that I have a lot of extra cholesterol in my body

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:01.080
 because my body is not properly converting it into hormones.

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.520
 You kind of forget that cholesterol,

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:04.920
 I sometimes forget that cholesterol

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.520
 is used to produce these hormones.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:10.320
 And so it's interesting that cholesterol will drop

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:14.040
 as your hormone-producing capabilities improve.

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:17.600
 And so I'm curious when I test my cholesterol again,

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.960
 once I get my period back,

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.840
 I'm curious what the level will be then.

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:28.880
 - In an experiment, someone isolated an ovary

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:33.560
 and measured in the vein coming out

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:36.040
 the amount of progesterone,

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:39.840
 and then they varied the amount of cholesterol

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:43.280
 in the artery going into the ovary.

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:46.280
 And as they increased the amount of cholesterol

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.080
 in the blood, the amount of progesterone

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:52.000
 coming out of the ovary directly increased.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.360
 - Very interesting.

01:17:54.360 --> 01:18:00.680
 - An increase of cholesterol in hypothyroidism

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:04.840
 is exactly because your body needs it

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:09.200
 to make up for the fact that progesterone,

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:13.200
 thyroid is the essential factor

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.760
 for making the conversion of cholesterol to progesterone.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:21.480
 - Okay, and typically will carb diets

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:22.680
 increase your cholesterol?

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:25.520
 - Yeah, I certainly, my cholesterol was a lot higher

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.000
 when I was on zero carb, got up to like 490.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.680
 And I don't know, a lot of people

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:32.760
 in the keto carnivore space,

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:37.600
 I even said this, ketone production

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:40.440
 and cholesterol production, LDL cholesterol production

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.960
 are on the same pathway.

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:44.080
 And so if you increase your ketone production,

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.680
 you will automatically increase

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.120
 your LDL production as well.

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:51.520
 So it's just interesting that you see higher cholesterol

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:55.440
 in some of these individuals who are low carb, zero carb.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.920
 I was certainly one of those, what was it called?

01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.520
 - Hyper-

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.400
 - Lean mass hyper-responder.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:06.680
 - If your liver is under extreme stress,

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:11.160
 its ability to make cholesterol can begin to fail.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:16.160
 And so it's much worse to be deficient

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:21.560
 in blood cholesterol than to be excessive in it.

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:26.720
 The increase in cholesterol shows that you're adapting,

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:30.440
 your liver is able to help your ovaries

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:33.800
 and adrenals make the steroids.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:36.320
 - That's really interesting.

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.120
 - If your liver is in trouble,

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.720
 then you can't make enough cholesterol.

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.560
 - That's really interesting

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.840
 'cause it seems like there's a group of individuals

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.680
 who have normal cholesterol levels

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.720
 and then a group of individuals

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:49.800
 who have higher cholesterol levels.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:50.880
 And like I said, this was called

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.000
 like the lean mass hyper-responder group.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.520
 And so potentially the difference between those two groups

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.640
 is potentially the liver functionality.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.480
 - If someone is deficient,

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:05.320
 for sure it's the liver that's the main problem.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:11.320
 - Over the age of 50,

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:16.680
 a big study in aging people

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:22.040
 found that if you didn't have

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:28.440
 well over 200 level of cholesterol

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:31.880
 in your older years,

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:36.880
 your likelihood of being dependent was greatly increased

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:42.240
 because the anti-stress progesterone and so on

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:47.880
 is essential for protecting the brain.

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:52.880
 And if you're under 200 cholesterol and in your 50s,

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:55.800
 then you're in serious trouble.

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:59.480
 - Yeah, there seems to be some sort of like,

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.600
 the argument is there's a like a protective effect

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:05.600
 for LDL cholesterol, it's wrongly demonized.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:08.080
 - Right, right.

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:14.000
 And estrogen and many toxic substances

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.600
 are known to lower the good LDL cholesterol

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:24.080
 and increase the HDL.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:29.080
 So poisoning can cause what the doctors consider

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.320
 a healthy shift.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:34.920
 - So we're at an hour and a half now.

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:37.360
 And so we don't wanna take up more of your time.

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.080
 We'll have to get you back on another time.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.560
 We've really enjoyed discussing with you

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:45.440
 and kind of digging into some of these topics.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:49.160
 What are the best resources people can go to

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:52.560
 to learn the basics of your approach,

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.680
 such as like a website or a newsletter?

01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:02.080
 - Yeah, my website is rayPeate.com.

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:08.560
 - And can people subscribe to your newsletter

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.640
 on your website?

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:16.520
 - No, but you can get the information about subscribing

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:22.080
 at rayPeate's newsletter at gmail.com.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.400
 - Okay.

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.000
 - So if you made it this far,

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.080
 thank you for hanging out with us

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:31.200
 and watching this video of us.

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.440
 I hope that you had some takeaways

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:36.080
 and challenged some of your beliefs.

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:38.480
 Many of you all likely disagreed with some of his things

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.640
 and that is okay.

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:42.160
 We all agree to disagree.

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.360
 So like we said, if you have any more questions

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.680
 for Dr. Ray P, make sure you hit him in the comments below

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.160
 and we hope to be able to have him on again

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.480
 for another great discussion

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:53.040
 where you can just stare at us while he talks.

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:53.880
 It's great.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.120
 But until next time, you guys,

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.960
 make sure you are behaving like an angel.

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.480
 Make sure you are behaving like an angel
