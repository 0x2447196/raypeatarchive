00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.220
 - Well, welcome to the Get Fit with Jodell podcast.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.480
 It's time once again for Dr. Ray Pete.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.820
 He's joined me and is always so gracious with his time.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.500
 And I could go on and on about his laundry list

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.960
 of credentials and how long he's been teaching

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.860
 and researching nutrition,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.160
 in addition to authoring many books and publications,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.760
 longer than many of us have been alive.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.520
 And that's what makes him what I consider

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.740
 to be one of the leading authorities in nutrition

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.120
 and more specifically, women's hormonal health.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.960
 So Dr. Pete, thank you, thank you,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.680
 thank you so much for coming back.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.540
 How are you?

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.040
 - Very well.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.940
 - Awesome.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.800
 Well, before we get started with this great lineup

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.400
 of questions that so many of our listeners

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.200
 have put together for you,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.840
 I wanted to ask you kind of some rapid fire questions

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.760
 about yourself,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.480
 just so the audience can learn who Ray Pete is.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.140
 So these are just a few that popped off the top of my head

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.180
 that I thought I'd ask you.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.320
 So the first one is your favorite food.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:19.960
 - Depends on whether it's for practicality or for taste.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.440
 Why the deliciousness of a food?

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.280
 Probably things like cheese,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.360
 grilled cheese sandwich,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 or huevos trancheros, Mexican style.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.880
 But for practicality, any kind of cheese,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.480
 and milk, those are my basic staples.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.020
 - Okay, favorite animal.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:08.800
 - Oh, ants, I think.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.760
 - Really?

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.800
 Okay, I have to ask why.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.620
 - They're intelligent and they aren't as,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.480
 well, bees and wasps are equally intelligent,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.960
 but they tend to outsmart me.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.320
 And I can deal with ants and reason with them.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.280
 - I love that.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.520
 Okay, so since you paint, how about your favorite artist?

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:46.720
 - I, it has generally been red wire,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.720
 just because I like my manner of painting

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.040
 sort of assimilates his,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.560
 all of his different styles seem comfortable for me.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.160
 - How about your favorite place that you've ever visited?

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.160
 - Um, probably some spots in the triangle of Mexico.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:37.560
 - Oh, and how about someone you admire?

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.320
 - I have, most of them have died basically by the end.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:52.320
 Ralph Nader is a living person that I admire.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.440
 - And how about someone who has passed on that you admire?

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.800
 - Albert Centrochi, William Blake,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.280
 a whole line of philosophers, biologists,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.000
 educators, mostly descenders and very outside

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:26.440
 the culture of thinkers.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.680
 - I'm so glad you mentioned Albert St. Georgie

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.320
 because I actually had a question that I wanted to ask you.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.660
 Since you tend to talk thyroid a lot,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.360
 I wanted to know your thoughts on iodine supplementation

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.440
 and I had read something about Albert St. Georgie

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.600
 with iodine.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.440
 What are your thoughts?

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.880
 And the reason I had looked it up was I've read

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.120
 and researched that it can be protective against 5G

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.080
 and wanted to know how you feel about it.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:01.000
 - I have noticed that Centrochi has been misquoted

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.800
 on iodine in one of his books.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.800
 He gives a little jingle about iodine

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.160
 but his work didn't do anything special

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.140
 about iodine, he was very conscious of the electronic

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.320
 behavior of iodine in cells.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.320
 And his metabolic work was all around oxidation

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:40.980
 and what electrons are doing in cells.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:47.040
 And very slight excess of iodine can disrupt the function

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:54.520
 of the thyroid gland as well as the cellular handling

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.440
 of electrons and oxygen.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.320
 So it's a very touchy thing to supplement.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.320
 And there are cults, D. Abraham, or Guy Abraham,

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:19.440
 he happened to study in the same lab and department

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.280
 that I did for my PhD, so I had brief contact with him

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.840
 but he announced that he was the world's expert in iodine

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:40.620
 and then he advocated taking 10 milligrams a day

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.620
 or even more and he got two medical doctor followers

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:52.920
 to continue at his tradition but essentially

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.880
 he was mentally cracked on the subject

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.880
 and totally anti-scientific so I think he started

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.600
 a very dangerous tradition in which people think

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.600
 it's safe to take 10 milligrams of iodine per day.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.240
 - Well I'm so glad I asked you about that

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.180
 'cause one of his publications was one I came across.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.520
 So you wouldn't be a fan of any sort of iodine supplementation

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.220
 even in small doses?

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.760
 - Even iodized salt, I have a collection of,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.760
 I think it's 72 articles on the long range effects

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:42.920
 of adding iodine to salt over the last several decades

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:49.200
 and even approximately doubling the normal amount

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.120
 of iodine, the minimal amount is safe

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:02.060
 but definitely half a milligram of iodine per day extra

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:10.560
 over the long run causes thyroid glandular damage.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:17.060
 - And so it is important for the thyroid to have iodine

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.680
 but you might suggest that we just get it through

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.080
 what food we take in or food from the seeds.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.080
 - Yeah, for example, cows can give milk

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:35.080
 if they're deficient in iodine, the thyroid is essential

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:41.280
 for reproductive functions and so eggs and milk

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.840
 are guaranteed to contain adequate iodine

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.120
 and there was a study in the 60s that found that Americans,

00:08:52.120 --> 00:09:01.300
 almost every American eating a standard diet

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.960
 had a great excess of iodine in their diet

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.640
 and at that time it was coming from bread, iodine

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.600
 was used as a coal conditioner.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.320
 - Okay, very good, that's what I wanted to know

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.960
 so always glad I can ask you these things.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.720
 Okay, we're gonna jump into the question queue here

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.560
 and thank you guys, everybody that submitted questions,

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.800
 you guys are super fun whenever I post a thing about

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.140
 I'm gonna interview Dr. Pete, you're quick to respond

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.000
 and send in your questions so just look for those posts

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.520
 on YouTube every now and then and you'll be able

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.160
 to ask Dr. Pete anything you want.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.680
 Mike is our first one here, Mike's up and he says,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.360
 can you ask Dr. Pete about how to safely build muscle mass

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.200
 using weights and if a calorie surplus is needed

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.780
 and then a sample diet for dropping body fat?

00:09:53.780 --> 00:10:04.720
 - Anything that helps you build muscle helps you lose fat

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:11.360
 because muscle is where most of our calories

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:16.360
 are oxidized, just passively sitting your muscles

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:23.040
 for almost pure fat so having big muscles

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.360
 and sitting around all day, you won't get fat

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.720
 if you eat the right amount of calories for your activity.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.960
 And the Eastern Europeans in the 1960s

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.920
 kept being accused of doping with testosterone

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.000
 because they're athletes, both men and women

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 have higher testosterone levels very consistently

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.120
 over Americans and their secret,

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.960
 I guess some of them did dope with testosterone

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.960
 but their method of training caused their bodies

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:19.000
 to naturally increase ratio of testosterone to cortisol.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.300
 The muscle tissue shrinks under the influence of cortisol

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:31.320
 and grows under the influence of testosterone

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.280
 so it's a constant balance

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.880
 and if a person is under stress,

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.800
 there are little bit of testosterone

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.560
 that the body can manage to produce.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.520
 It binds to the heart, lungs and brain.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.520
 The heart muscle is powerfully protected by testosterone

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:04.120
 and it happens that these hormones are metabolized.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.040
 Every cell that has been studied in the right circumstance

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:15.440
 turns out to be able to create steroids.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:21.520
 The skin is one of our major steroid forming organisms.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.520
 It can even produce the pituitary hormones

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:31.800
 needed to stimulate its own production of steroids

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.440
 and muscle cells can produce testosterone

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:43.520
 and if they are not stressed,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.280
 the right amount of exertion,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.480
 especially concentric contraction

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.640
 contracting against resistance

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.200
 shifts the balance towards actually producing

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.480
 some testosterone locally

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.480
 as well as responding to testosterone

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:19.880
 and blocking cortisol shrinking effect

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.880
 but if the cell reaches the level of activity

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.440
 that it can't gain enough oxygen from the blood,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.920
 then it begins producing lactic acid

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.320
 and at that point, it shifts over

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.320
 to actually producing some internal cortisol

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.760
 with the whole body system

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.400
 under the influence of lactic acid

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.200
 shifts into the stress mode

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.680
 and so the Eastern Europeans have found

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.960
 that if the trainer would watch

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.960
 for the point at which lactic acid began to form

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.280
 and made the athletes stop training,

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.960
 it always seems far too early for the athletes

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.960
 but when the trainer made them stop training so much,

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.700
 then their performance went tremendously higher.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.680
 - I love that, that's kind of a strategy

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.200
 that I sometimes employ with my clients

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.120
 when I train them is let me just get you right

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.800
 to the brink of where that lactic acid starts coming in

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.880
 and then shut it down.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.280
 So that's pretty cool to know

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.680
 that other trainers in Europe are doing that.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.260
 So as far as like a sample diet,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.960
 what would you recommend for Mike?

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:52.720
 - Making sure that you get enough calcium

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.720
 and vitamin T, which lots of doctors will think

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:04.200
 that sounds very silly but catechzia or sarcopenia

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:12.040
 under stress or cancer or aging or hypothyroidism

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:19.760
 an extreme if a person has the thyroid gland removed

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.380
 and doesn't have a supplement,

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:27.360
 they experience catechzia, the muscles waste away

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.680
 because thyroid hormone is our first anabolic hormone.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:40.080
 It activates muscle growth, everything else being adequate

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:49.320
 and to do that, it produces energy efficiently

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.320
 resulting in carbon dioxide adequate to be a barrier.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:02.120
 The more carbon dioxide you have the more completely

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:08.120
 you suppress glycolysis and lactic acid formation.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.440
 So you can exert more to the extent

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.640
 that you can produce a corresponding amount

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.440
 of carbon dioxide.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.440
 It's carbon dioxide that holds down the lactic production.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:30.160
 And so if you're deficient in calcium and vitamin G,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:37.480
 your parathyroid hormone increases

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:42.480
 to draw calcium out of your bones and parathyroid hormone

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:50.060
 is a powerful anti-mitochondrial, it suppresses

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:56.920
 the formation of carbon dioxide in production of energy.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:01.200
 So a calcium and vitamin D deficiency

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.200
 is its first step towards wasting of your muscles.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.080
 - Yeah, we definitely don't want that.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.980
 So that's really good recommendation

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.800
 to keep that calcium and vitamin D rich foods going.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.720
 Okay, Karen asks, I take MSM and glutathione

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.960
 to help with the fact that my naturopath

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.300
 says I don't handle sulfur well.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.860
 How does one begin to start handling sulfur well

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.680
 and are you a fan of MSM and glutathione?

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:36.680
 - Definitely not, glutathione is, in itself,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.720
 it's electronically reducing.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.720
 It tends to donate electrons like ascorbic acid

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.840
 is a reducing agent and sulfur compounds

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.720
 are commonly reducing agents.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:07.120
 But the whole established biochemical

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.480
 even still what most biochemistry professors

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:20.320
 are teaching a mistaken idea of how

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:27.360
 the balance of reducing and oxidizing works in the body.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:34.560
 Glutathione in the stable oxidizing state of the cell

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.760
 is oxidized into the disulfide form.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:47.560
 It's an SS bond rather than an SH bond.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:53.360
 Ascorbic acid inside the healthy cell

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.840
 exists as dehydroascorbate.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.840
 That's why you can cure scurvy very easily by eating meat

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.840
 even though you can't find any measurable

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:12.440
 ascorbic acid that they speak of in meat.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.040
 If you eat it, you get an abundance

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.220
 of ascorbic acid released because it has a lot

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:26.220
 of the material in the oxidized form as dehydroascorbate.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.280
 And it works in that form inside the cell.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.160
 Ascorbic acid is working as an oxidant

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:42.240
 and one of the first things it oxidizes

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:47.240
 is glutathione to put it into the disulfide form.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:53.520
 And that blocks proteins into a stable

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.240
 anti-stress configuration.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.320
 When the cell is stressed, injured,

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.320
 reduced alcohol poisoning, estrogen excess,

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.280
 anything that injuries it and causes it

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.360
 to go into a cell division mode

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.800
 causes a tremendous explosion all through the cell

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.800
 of measurable glutathione which wasn't there

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.800
 in the resting condition because the dehydroascorbate

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.560
 was keeping it oxidized.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:36.120
 And if you happen to eat a reducing agent

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:42.000
 like glutathione or vitamin C in the presence

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.040
 of even a trace amount of copper or iron

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:53.040
 or other oxidizing metal, just a trace of those metals

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.120
 will cause tremendous free radical formation

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:05.520
 and damage from the reducing power of ascorbic acid

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:11.000
 or NADH or glutathione.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.160
 Those things should be produced inside the cell

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:20.160
 only in response to stress and if you eat them as such,

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.220
 then they're very potentially toxic.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.440
 - Okay, and then how would she go about starting

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.640
 to handle sulfur well?

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.800
 'Cause it sounds like she doesn't handle sulfur rich foods

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.400
 and she wants to be able to.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:44.080
 - The trace elements and vitamins are making sure

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:49.480
 that you're well nourished for trace elements.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:54.480
 For example, eating fish or other seafoods from the ocean,

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:59.800
 one meal of that a week will provide selenium

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:04.800
 and other minerals and having eggs every day

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:12.600
 will provide not only an abundance of the sulfur amino acids

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:19.000
 but also a good balance of the vitamins you need

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.460
 for metabolizing them.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:26.460
 - Okay, and then we have Naomi and she was curious about,

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.840
 she heard that you use hydrogenated coconut oil

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.160
 instead of cold pressed and she wanted to know why.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:42.560
 - The filtration is one thing.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.560
 The so-called virgin coconut oil,

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.960
 sometimes it has a delicious flavor

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.120
 which is great for making ice cream.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:23:02.440
 Using no cream at all but an egg

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.440
 to emulsify the unfiltered coconut oil,

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:13.500
 you get a delicious, fresh coconut tasting ice cream.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.140
 So it's good for flavoring or making cookies or something

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.440
 but it's a staple.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:26.520
 Those unfiltered flavorful things contain enzymes

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:35.880
 that can break down the fats and lead to rancidity

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:43.200
 but there are also a lot of allergenic materials

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.220
 and quite a few people have a bad reaction

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:51.220
 to unfiltered or poorly filtered coconut oil

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:57.200
 and in the process of solidifying it by hydrogenation

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:04.900
 they always start with a very well-filtered oil

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:09.900
 and then ordinary coconut oil contains around 3%

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.360
 of the polyunsaturated fatty acids

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.360
 and the small percentage of the Puffa

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:25.120
 is what makes coconut oil so much safer

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.320
 than other vegetable oils

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:34.320
 but still that 3% over a lifetime

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.760
 that those tenders get stored in your tissues

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.760
 and proceed to their toxic effects

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.880
 so for total avoidance as far as possible.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:54.480
 If I could find a safely hydrated vitinizer butter,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.760
 I think I would do that but the process

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.640
 would destroy the good flavor of butter

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.480
 which is its main value.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.720
 - Yeah and I have clients that they wanna fry their eggs

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.240
 and they would go grab the most expensive

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.800
 unrefined cold-pressed virgin coconut oil

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.240
 and they're like my eggs taste like suntan lotion

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:21.080
 and that's why I said yeah, it's just fine to do the refined,

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.080
 the cheapest coconut oil, you can find the hydrogenated

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.040
 just fine because then you also won't have

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.920
 that coconut flavor in there.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.280
 You're just gonna have the nice oil to fry in.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:35.280
 - Yeah and you can mix butter and hydrated coconut oil

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.760
 and you still get the butter flavor.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.960
 - Good, okay, so the next name is a little hard

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.800
 to pronounce, UPCAR, UPCAR is the name, UPCAR become,

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.120
 says, can my wife who's 51 years of age

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.600
 take sal palmetto for falling hair?

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.880
 Secondly, can sal palmetto act as pregnant alone in the body?

00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:00.720
 - It does have some of those actions

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.720
 but I've never actually seen any good things

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:06.920
 that benefits from it.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.920
 I've been watching because of that analogous steroid effect,

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.080
 it theoretically should have some

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.040
 but I've just never known anyone

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.840
 to have noticeable results from it.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.080
 - Okay, all right, Kathleen has a couple questions here.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.640
 She asks, can you ask Dr. Pete what about oxalates?

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.880
 What about salicylates?

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.360
 And then also liver detox, specifically glucuronidation

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.000
 for salicylates.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.360
 Why does some have hypoglycemia from fruit?

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.640
 And then we'll go to a couple more she has after that

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.600
 but first your thoughts on oxalates and salicylates

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.000
 and glucuronidation.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.640
 - Three very separate issues.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:06.080
 Our body can oxidize oxalic acid.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:14.000
 It isn't necessarily a problem in moderate amounts

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.440
 but it can bind up minerals.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.160
 So if you eat it in any quantity,

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:26.160
 it could steal magnesium, for example, from your diet.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.880
 So it definitely isn't a good food diet

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.280
 that you've put in a very small amounts.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:42.800
 Plants that have a lot of it

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.480
 can actually take calcium out of your cheese.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:53.480
 So I tend to avoid the foods that contain it

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.800
 just because of their damaging effect

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.960
 on magnesium and calcium metabolism.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:07.120
 And salicylates, the term is very misleadingly misused.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:15.400
 Willowbark and the very few other plants

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.320
 actually contain salicylic acid

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.320
 or actual aspirin, acetyl salicylate.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.560
 But people are using it for basically anything

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.960
 with the benzene range structure.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.680
 And that includes almost everything living.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:43.880
 And that has led to a kind of culty sphere of fruit.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:50.520
 And the same range of molecules

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:55.520
 contains the incredibly beneficial flavonoid family.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:01.720
 Those are often called salicylates

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:06.160
 but they have little to do with salicylate,

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.400
 as you can imagine.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:13.400
 But they have very far ranging anti-oxidant effects

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.120
 and the anti-toxic.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.640
 Very important substances.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:28.640
 That's one of the reasons I advocate drinking orange juice

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:35.600
 as far as you can get a good tasting sweet orange juice

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.040
 without very much citric acid

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.920
 because citric acid is another thing

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.920
 that damages your cheese and in large amounts citric acid

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.560
 even though it enters the citric acid cycle

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.960
 and can be oxidized.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.640
 It's another one of those things

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.960
 that is perfectly healthy in its place.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.160
 But when you eat it,

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.720
 that isn't its proper place in metabolism.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:12.720
 And when it's out of its normal place in the system,

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.320
 then it has the potential to be toxic.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:22.720
 But fruits, guavas and oranges

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:28.480
 are among the highest in these flavonoid protective agents

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.840
 and they like ascorbic acid inside the cell

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:39.800
 even though they're considered anti-oxidants

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.040
 inside the cell their beneficial effect

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.680
 is because they act as catalysts to oxidation

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.720
 like dehydroascorbate does

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:54.720
 are tending to keep the cell out of reducing stress.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.240
 - I'm so glad you said that about fruit

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.160
 because I have a hard time believing

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.760
 that something that was intended by a creator in nature

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.360
 to assist us in our health would be inappropriate.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.280
 Like if it's unadulterated found in nature,

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.240
 if we had to live off the land,

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.800
 it would be the perfect food

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.000
 since it has everything, you don't have to cook it.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.040
 You don't have to salt it.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.120
 You don't have to do anything.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.480
 You take a fruit and you eat it.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.920
 It's nature's perfect vision.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:31.920
 - The squirrel monkey is notoriously long lives for its size.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:37.600
 A squirrel lives maybe eight or 10 years or something,

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.280
 but the squirrel monkey of the same size

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.280
 lives about 30 years, very unusual for an animal that small

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:52.440
 and its diet in nature consists purely of fruit

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:57.800
 and it also has one of the biggest brain to body ratios

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.760
 and index of intelligence of all animals.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:10.240
 That demonstrates the power of fruit nutritionally.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:15.240
 Fruit and pelicans are safest natural foods.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.840
 - And she asks about estrogen and calcium deglucrate.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.000
 So would this be helpful for lowering estrogen?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.360
 What do you think about calcium deglucrate?

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:33.200
 - That has been advocated for an anti-estrogen treatment

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.480
 and an anti-cancer treatment.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.980
 And it probably has benefit.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:47.400
 Logically, glucuronidation is a fundamental way

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:53.100
 that we rid the body of estrogen.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:59.320
 100% of estrogen should be excreted and not recycled

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.520
 when the liver is exposed to it,

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.720
 it should be immediately annihilated

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:11.220
 by a testing glucuronic acid or sulfuric acid to it.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:17.160
 But when something damages the liver's metabolic rate

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:22.640
 such as hypothyroidism, then the liver can allow

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:28.220
 all of the estrogen that it receives to pass through

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.880
 unmodified and that becomes carcinogenic

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:37.880
 and produces PMS and epilepsy and all of the consequences.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:47.160
 And thyroid hormone and good nutrition are the things

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:52.400
 that activate glucuronidation and sulfotransferase.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.440
 So if you're ready to play a supplement like that,

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:05.580
 should add some raw material needed for the process.

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.680
 - Yeah, and the fruits that you mentioned,

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.680
 the guava and the oranges and things like that,

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:16.140
 they actually help to pull excess estrogen out of the body.

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:19.080
 So I mean, yeah, going back to the fruit along with that

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.700
 is going to be really good for that individual as well.

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:26.560
 Natasha asks about spider veins.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.360
 So she says, although I suspect he'll mention copper

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.940
 and also the best solutions for a safe deodorant.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:39.480
 - Solutions for what was the last word?

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.520
 - So the first part is about spider veins

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.840
 and then the second part is about a safe deodorant.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.640
 - Oh, deodorant, oh.

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:55.720
 Washing regularly is the safest deodorant.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.860
 - Deodorant, but if there's a bacteria growing there

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:06.040
 or a fungus, a safe antiseptic like sulfur soap,

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:12.880
 one bath using 10% sulfur soap will sometimes

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:19.440
 permanently eliminate an underarm odor problem

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:24.440
 by destroying the microorganism that's causing

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:29.000
 the fat material to break down.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.120
 Spider veins traditionally have been associated with

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:42.600
 chronic unopposed estrogen and what they're apparently

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:50.300
 developing in response to is some kind of an oxygen delivery

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:57.520
 problem in that area of tissue and things that improve

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:05.340
 oxygenation, vitamin K has been used topically.

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:10.440
 It's in principle, it could help,

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.400
 but I don't know how effective,

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:18.400
 but progesterone systemically or topically

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:23.920
 and especially thyroid to help you excrete estrogen.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:28.360
 Those are things that traditionally worked.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:33.240
 - So yeah, it is more of an estrogen dominant thing

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.480
 that she would be having the spider veins?

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:40.120
 Okay, all right, Jesse asks, what is the best way

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.440
 to reduce bowel inflammation in cases

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.920
 where one is already addressing thyroid issues

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.640
 and using dietary therapies such as eating carrot salads,

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.520
 bamboo shoots, eggshell powder, and OJ,

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.920
 so reducing bowel inflammation?

00:36:54.920 --> 00:37:05.520
 - Some people find that the particle size

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:10.400
 of eggshell powder to be a problem.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:15.400
 You might experiment using maybe a coffee grinder

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.440
 that can reduce it to the fineness of the talcum powder

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:28.680
 and then take it with food and trying a different brand

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.800
 of orange juice, I've found that some brands

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:41.040
 that I have used, for example, a frozen orange juice

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:46.040
 concentrate used for years, pulp-free so-called.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:50.200
 I noticed that it started causing intense,

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.000
 intestinal inflammation and it also started leaving

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 a residue of gummy material on the glass after I drank it.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:07.080
 So I changed brands and found one that was truly pulp-free

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.480
 and had no more inflammation.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:18.520
 And sometimes a supplement is a villain.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:25.480
 Vitamin B supplement, a scarpic acid, tablets,

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:34.640
 many of the most popular supplements

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.480
 cause horrible inflammation to the intestine.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.760
 - A lot of people use a glutamine for the intestines,

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.160
 like for leaky gut, what do you think about that?

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:50.680
 - Any of the manufactured so-called pure chemicals

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:55.560
 are risky because in the manufacturing process,

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.840
 every stage that goes through, it can pick up

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.040
 some foreign material and trace them out.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:06.240
 And all it takes for an allergic reaction

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:11.240
 is a trace analysis would almost always be invisible.

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:23.480
 It would take an ultra-fine analysis

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:28.480
 to guarantee the purity of something like glutamine

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:33.520
 or glutathione or any of the things sold as pure chemicals.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.040
 - Alrighty, Amanda asks, what can one do

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.920
 for histamine mast cell issues?

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.480
 I've had a spot on my foot for the longest time

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.920
 that will just not stop itching,

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.560
 usually when warm from wearing shoes.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.200
 It used to blister and contain clear liquid

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.080
 that has stopped after a few months

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.520
 following Ray Pete's protocols.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.240
 I'm about a year and a half in now.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.600
 I was originally diagnosed with a form of eczema.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.920
 I've also discovered I have issues with vibration

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.800
 using a percussion massager.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:13.200
 So I was told it was due to high histamine levels.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.160
 Is that true and what can I do?

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:23.880
 - Estrogen is the main promoter

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.880
 of overproduction of mast cells and histamine.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:35.600
 Once you get an inflamed area in any part of the body,

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:42.080
 a place you have had a mosquito bite, for example,

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:46.680
 mast cells can move in and live forever

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:51.680
 the rest of your life as a potential site of inflammation.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:00.920
 The local anesthetics happen to be,

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:07.320
 as far as I know, all of them are functional antihistamines.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:13.640
 And so treating the itchy spot with enodril

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:21.320
 or benzocaine ointment or lidocaine ointment,

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:26.320
 any of those things that stops the itching momentarily

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:31.720
 can have a long range therapeutic effect

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:36.720
 because it's interfering with the histamine production

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:43.040
 and in a way training the mast cells

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.600
 to become more stable.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.600
 - Okay, that's good, I like that.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.040
 I've never thought about it that way before.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.760
 Person known as I love sugar,

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.280
 I think they've asked questions before.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.440
 Thank you for your question.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.520
 He asks, please ask Dr. Pete.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.320
 I read some research that copper supplement absorption

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:05.840
 is drastically down regulated above two milligrams a day.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.880
 I don't have adequate access to copper rich foods

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.360
 other than liver.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.240
 Does Dr. Pete think that eating liver weekly,

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.800
 three to four ounces,

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.160
 would still cover the RDA requirements for the whole week?

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.480
 I have orange calluses and is there a way to use the liver

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:26.640
 as a copper supplement without risking vitamin A excess?

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:34.720
 - Thyroid hormone is probably the major regulator

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.400
 of copper absorption and metabolism

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:43.400
 because the crucial oxidizing enzyme

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:48.960
 that thyroid activates as cytochrome C oxidase

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.760
 is a copper containing enzyme.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.600
 And so,

00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:02.640
 increasing your thyroid function

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.480
 increases your ability to absorb and use copper.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:12.600
 - Good, okay, moving right along.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:17.600
 Jimmy asks, what biomarkers to keep track of for longevity?

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:21.160
 So what biomarkers would you recommend

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.920
 that we keep track of for longevity purposes?

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:30.800
 - Keeping your lactic acid low under carbon dioxide high.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:36.320
 For over a hundred years,

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:40.360
 insurance companies have known that people living

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.480
 in very high altitude cities,

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:49.640
 in the Andes, for example, or the Himalayas,

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:57.240
 these people typically are about 10% lower

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:02.080
 than the world average

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.160
 in all of the degenerative diseases

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.960
 at dementia, cancer, and heart disease.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:13.960
 And even the altitude differences within New Mexico,

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:19.560
 which are very moderate compared to the Andes and Himalayas,

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:25.480
 have showed the same reduction of degenerative disease.

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.480
 And what happens at high altitude is

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:35.840
 the lungs are allowed because there is less oxygen.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.720
 The lungs are able to retain

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.040
 a much higher level of carbon dioxide.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.760
 And that carbon dioxide retention,

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.320
 when you're adapted to high altitude,

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:54.440
 the carbon dioxide powerfully suppresses

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.000
 lactic acid production.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.160
 That has been called the lactate paradox of altitude,

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.200
 because you can exercise very intensely

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:09.040
 and not produce nearly as much lactic acid

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.160
 as you would with the same amount of activity at sea level.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:20.120
 And so lactic acid down, carbon dioxide up,

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:24.840
 are the most powerful indicators

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.800
 of good health in one life.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.040
 - Okay, we are sailing right through these,

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.440
 but we've got a ways to go,

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.880
 so we'll just have to stop at some point,

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.600
 but I'm gonna keep going with a few more here.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.640
 So if we don't get to your question,

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.760
 we'll get to it on the next call, I promise.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.920
 Luke asks, how does someone become allergic to pork

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.200
 and what to do about it?

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:51.840
 - I think stopping at eating pork

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:56.840
 is the easiest and possibly the only solution.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:03.280
 But you can reduce all of your food sensitivities

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:09.080
 by keeping your glucose metabolism optimal.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:15.600
 And the three things for a normalizer

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.680
 and maintaining good glucose oxidation

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:23.680
 are thyroid, calcium intake, and vitamin D.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:31.400
 One of Hans Seljes associates did some very good studies

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:36.720
 on animals, showing that food, he arranged allergens

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:43.360
 from an allergen that would cause very quick death

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:47.120
 down to one that would cause sniffles

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.040
 in the experimental rats.

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:56.080
 And then he adjusted, he would give them a little insulin

00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.920
 to lower their blood sugar by 50%.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.000
 And he found that the mild allergen

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.120
 that normally cause sniffles could kill them

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.840
 when their blood sugar was just 50% lower than normal.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:15.160
 But then he infused glucose,

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.440
 arranged their glucose to 300 milligrams,

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.360
 percent about three times normal.

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:27.360
 And even the deadly allergens with the high glucose

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.920
 produced only the mild sniffles.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:37.680
 So your glucose metabolism is almost always

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.520
 the most powerful factor.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:45.520
 Behind those sensitivities and behind the glucose problem,

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:51.040
 it's usually calcium, vitamin D, and thyroid

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:56.040
 keeping down the toxic hormone such as parathyroid hormone

00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:01.920
 and angiotensin and albasterone and estrogen and so on.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:06.560
 - Yeah, I wanna talk more about angiotensin

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.160
 in one of our next podcast

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.480
 'cause I want to pick your brain about that.

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:15.720
 Turkish Postman asks, and this is a really good question,

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.800
 it's kind of personal towards you, Dr. Pete,

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.640
 but it is a really good question.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:23.320
 What would Dr. Pete do if he had been diagnosed with cancer?

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:28.320
 - Several times, about 45 or 50 years ago,

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:37.240
 two or three doctors were sure I had

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.280
 at least a pre-cancerous condition.

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:45.280
 And since I had studied what cancerologists

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:52.240
 and oncologists do when they, biopsy at least,

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:57.560
 diagnosed with cancer, I had no intention at all

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:02.560
 of having a specialist confirm that it was even pre-cancerous

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:09.280
 because I knew I had absolutely confidence

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.960
 that the treatments were more harmful than the disease.

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:19.040
 So in the first case for what was apparently leukoplakia,

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:23.560
 I had increased my vitamin A intake tremendously.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.760
 And within a week, it had disappeared.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:31.760
 And I realized I had experienced that previously in the past

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:37.080
 and that it was probably accidentally increasing

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.680
 my vitamin A that caused it to disappear.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:44.680
 So I, the last time I was diagnosed with cancer,

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:49.960
 the leukoplakia of the mouth is essentially similar

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:58.520
 to what has been diagnosed as a pre-cancerous uterine

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.960
 condition on the cervix.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:05.560
 And so I told some women about my experience

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.720
 and they found the same thing.

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:12.720
 They're supposedly pre-cancerous cervical condition

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.260
 within a month went back to normal.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:22.960
 And in the other case, a doctor, I had my shirt off

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:29.400
 and a doctor, actually two different individuals

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:33.120
 at different times said that really looks

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:38.320
 like a dangerous melanoma, you should have it checked.

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:42.800
 And I have been watching it with anxiety

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:46.520
 at its rapid deformed growth.

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.520
 But I happened to just start experimenting

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:53.400
 just for other reasons.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:58.040
 I was interested in what DHEA would do,

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.360
 especially combined with progesterone.

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.760
 I was taking a small amounts of those

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:08.040
 just about the time that the doctor made the comment.

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:13.920
 And about three or four days later, I looked down

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:18.560
 and it looked like I had a maraschino cherry on my belly

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:23.560
 where the ugly melanoma had grown about 10 fold

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:29.800
 over the last few months and was becoming a very deformed

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:35.000
 looking but suddenly it was a maraschino cherry.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.400
 And there was a bit of black on it.

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:44.400
 I thought it looked like possibly a giant tick

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:49.000
 inflating with blood but I knew I had touched it

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.560
 and the black stuff just fell off,

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.280
 leaving a little blood drop.

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:57.640
 And over the next couple of days,

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:02.640
 that glossy red globe shrank away

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.520
 and it revealed the little brown moles that I had had

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.600
 in that spot all my life

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.960
 until the big black things started growing.

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:18.640
 And so over the next 40 years,

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:23.720
 every time something would pop up looking

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:28.360
 at like developing skin cancer,

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:33.360
 even to the point of having a bloody spot on it,

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.880
 I would take a little bit

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:41.880
 of either of those PHEA or progesterone orally

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:46.400
 or I would, I found that if I rubbed it into the skin,

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.120
 keeping it about an inch away

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:54.120
 so that the vitamin E didn't irritate

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:58.160
 that already irritated area,

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:03.240
 that the thing looking like a melanoma

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:08.240
 would simply go away and return to absolutely normal tissue.

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:14.240
 And one growth that was the size of a jumble ollie

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:19.280
 that had come up in just a matter of over about a month.

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:25.080
 And within two weeks of this increase of PHEA

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:33.200
 and progesterone, the whole thing had shriveled away

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.120
 and didn't even leave a scar.

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:42.320
 And I've had internal symptoms

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:48.120
 that I suspected were similar processes,

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.840
 polyps, and so on.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:55.840
 And I've always simply ignored them.

00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:01.880
 The history of prostate cancer treatment

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.880
 as the treatment was refined

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:11.280
 through the middle of the last century,

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.720
 prostate cancer mortality continued to increase.

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:21.480
 In the 1980s, the prostate specific antigen was discovered

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:27.320
 and used as a sign that they could give earlier treatment

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.960
 by identifying cancer earlier.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:38.960
 And in the early 90s, using the PSA

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:43.080
 to find cancer at an early stage,

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:50.240
 not only the diagnosis of prostate cancer increased.

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:54.440
 At that time, the main treatments were

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:02.720
 usually systemic estrogen,

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:06.040
 even if prostate surgery

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.280
 was used to radically remove the gland,

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.560
 the person would usually get large doses of estrogen.

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:17.560
 But there was this surge of approximately 50% more cancers

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:24.640
 than I had noticed, but the death rate

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:29.320
 from prostate cancer surged similarly,

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:33.160
 about a 50% increase in the short time

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:35.440
 of deaths from prostate cancer.

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:39.880
 That led to a backing off.

00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:44.880
 And there was a survey of people who specialized

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:49.960
 in neurological cancers.

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:53.920
 They were asked the people with a lot of experience

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.240
 in treating prostate cancer,

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.640
 they were asked what they would do

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.920
 if they were diagnosed with prostate cancer.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:05.440
 And the great majority of them said nothing

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:08.360
 because they had seen that the treatments

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:11.120
 caused earlier deaths rather than later.

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:14.880
 And that led to the policy of what they called

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.360
 one full weighting.

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:21.640
 And if you look at the very few studies,

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.360
 starting in the '50s,

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:30.200
 in which they actually compared doing nothing

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:35.200
 to the quicker treatment and usually surgery,

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.200
 radiation, and chemotherapy,

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:41.200
 people lived much longer who did nothing.

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:44.960
 So as far as the evidence exists,

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:50.160
 it implies that doing nothing

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.200
 is going to be life extending.

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:55.960
 - I completely agree.

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:59.040
 My own mom was diagnosed with stomach cancer

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:04.040
 and was given a 5% chance of living for two to five years.

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:07.880
 And after taking the traditional treatment,

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.640
 the chemo and radiation, she lived one year.

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.760
 So had she done nothing, she could have lived longer

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.720
 just dealing with the fact that she had trouble swallowing.

00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:20.680
 And so it's interesting, as you say,

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.400
 I think if we would think more about giving the body

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.040
 the proper conditions to repair,

00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:29.560
 it will do so rather than jumping to the Band-Aid solution.

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:32.840
 So yeah, I love that you've experienced it

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:35.960
 to be what you know is cancer within you,

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:39.000
 but yet you chose to just provide the body

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.040
 with what it needed, novel idea.

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:45.440
 So do you have time for a couple more?

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.120
 We're almost towards the end here.

00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:50.360
 We'll only have a couple of people

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:51.800
 that don't get their questions answered

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.400
 and we'll put them in the queue for next time.

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:58.400
 So this next one is from EpicKiller30.

00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:01.200
 "What is the cause of excess saliva?"

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.800
 And I really like the second part of his questions.

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:04.920
 I'm curious about this.

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:08.180
 And the common cause of high serotonin in children.

00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:12.600
 - And the last question.

00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:16.240
 - The most common cause for high serotonin in children.

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:20.640
 - In children was the last word?

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.080
 - Yes, yes, mm-hmm.

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:31.400
 - The intestine produces 95% of the body's serotonin

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:38.840
 and the glands, such as the salivary gland,

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:48.000
 are very responsive to the composition of the blood.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000
 The blood picks up essentially all of the serotonin

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.640
 produced in the intestine, a really large amount of it.

00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:02.640
 And the platelets bind it and carry it to the lungs

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:10.440
 as long as there is carbon dioxide adequate in the blood.

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:16.400
 The platelets are able to firmly hold the serotonin

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:23.040
 so the tissues don't experience the serotonin at all

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:29.280
 as it passes through the bloodstream heading for the lungs.

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:34.200
 And the surge of oxygen and the sudden loss

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:38.840
 of carbon dioxide causes the platelets

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:42.120
 to release the serotonin.

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:47.120
 And the serotonin runs into lung enzymes that destroy it.

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:54.920
 And in experiments, if you're monitoring their capillaries,

00:59:54.920 --> 01:00:04.520
 you can see the size of the capillary

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:09.280
 and whether it's being obstructed.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:14.280
 If a person hyperventilates and loses too much carbon dioxide

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:20.680
 all through the body, the platelets become unable

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:25.680
 to hang onto the carbon dioxide until it reaches the lungs,

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:32.600
 unable to hang onto the serotonin until they reach the lungs.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.080
 So they release the serotonin indiscriminately

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:43.440
 in the bloodstream and that causes capillaries

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:49.080
 wherever the serotonin is released from capillaries.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:53.880
 It causes constriction of the capillaries

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:59.880
 combined with edema, swelling of the wall of the capillary

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:06.240
 and surrounding tissues and leakiness of the capillary.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:13.600
 So a very bad condition can be set up in the whole body

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:18.280
 just by hyperventilating enough to lower the CO2

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:23.280
 and to interrupt the platelets function

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.320
 of getting rid of the serotonin.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:32.200
 And anything that makes you tend to not produce

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:37.400
 enough carbon dioxide, hypothyroidism, for example,

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:43.360
 leads to what amounts to hyperventilation

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.920
 because you don't have enough CO2 being produced.

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:51.680
 So the lactic acid comes up throughout your system

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:57.440
 and so that can cause the equivalent

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.760
 of serotonin poisoning everywhere.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:06.080
 And the parasympathetic nervous overactivity

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:13.040
 is known to cause excessive salivation,

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:19.240
 but something like a systemic imbalance of the regulation

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:24.680
 of both the platelets and mast cells could contribute to it.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:29.800
 - Okay, very good.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:34.800
 Okay, final question here, DPS0404 is the name

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.240
 and they ask any helpful suggestions for reversing,

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.800
 dissolving the very beginning stages of cataracts?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
 - The actual event happening surprisingly,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:02.840
 substance becomes stiffer but actually experience

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:11.440
 the kind of cellular edema that's the opaque area

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:19.160
 of a cataract is whether has a higher water content

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:23.320
 than the normal transparent regions

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:32.520
 and estrogen or lack of oxygen is one of the things

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:40.000
 that can add to this unnatural uptake of water

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:47.040
 and caffeine and the stabilizing steroids

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:56.200
 everything from cholesterol, true pregnenolone

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:02.560
 and progesterone, all of these things help offset

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:07.400
 that over hydrating effect that stress has.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.160
 So increasing the B vitamins,

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.240
 making sure you're producing enough cholesterol

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:24.120
 and have enough fibroid that you can convert the cholesterol

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.400
 to the protective hormones.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.400
 I think that's the basic way to retard the formation.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.960
 I've known two or three people.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:39.960
 My brother was one of them when he was about 65,

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:45.080
 his optometrist said he had cataracts starting

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:52.920
 about 10 years later, he had another exam

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:56.280
 and asked about the cataracts.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:01.280
 And the doctor said, you could see where they had been

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:06.960
 but there was no functional cataract left.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:11.960
 And he had just been slightly improving his diet,

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.720
 not nearly enough calcium and vitamin G

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.600
 but made some improvements.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.880
 - Yes, once again, I think if you give the body

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.200
 the proper conditions, it can do wondrous things.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.040
 So that's what I appreciate about you

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.080
 is that you seem to know quite a bit

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.960
 about how to help us give it the proper conditions.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:37.800
 So all right, that wraps it up for today, Dr. Pete.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.920
 You've been so helpful and I'm so thankful for you

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.520
 that we can do this and I look forward to the next one.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.520
 We already have some questions in the queue for the next time.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:50.240
 So where can people find out about you

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.600
 and read more of these awesome publications

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:56.560
 you were mentioning earlier as well as taking an order

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.280
 for your newsletter, which I highly recommend.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:05.600
 - My website is repeat.com.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:11.800
 And the newsletter information is at repeatnewsletter.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:20.640
 It has an S in it, no apostrophe, at gmail.com.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:25.640
 - Yeah, and I will have that in the show notes as well.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:26.680
 Thank you, Dr. Pete.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.840
 Once again, I always love this with you.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.400
 So we will reconvene again soon.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:34.000
 - Okay, thanks.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.320
 - All right, thanks everybody.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.440
 Bye for now.

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:39.020
 (upbeat music)

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:42.800
 - Parabola code time.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.640
 You know what?

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:46.840
 ATP science products are some of the best supplements

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.120
 on the market to date that I have used personally

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:52.520
 and recommended to my nutrition clients for years.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:55.140
 They were developed by a naturopathic doctor

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:58.200
 and he's meticulous about handcrafted ingredients.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.000
 So here's some of my favorite products.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.800
 The hydrolyzed no-way collagen protein powder is delectable.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.880
 The Alpha Prime product helped regulate my hormones

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:09.960
 after toxic mold exposure.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.560
 And the CordRX product helped immensely

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.640
 with regulating my cortisol and sleep.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.580
 And I cannot say enough about their topical rubs,

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:20.800
 Subcut, and my personal favorite, the Block E3.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:23.100
 So Block E3 is actually really great

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.640
 for blocking harmful estrogen just underneath the skin

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:29.000
 and preventing that buildup of cellulite

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.760
 and kind of the lumpy bumpies.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.440
 So I've got a promo code for you

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.920

 I'm like a librarian. (chuckles)

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.240
 Come in, come into my library.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.160
 Don't mind the excessive blue light

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.120
 'cause I have blue blockers for you.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.720
 Oh, there's some sort of schwartz on this one.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:09.720
 So with so many options on the Swanwick website,

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:13.920
 I thought I'd show you some of the different fits

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:18.360
 and show you just how cool blocking blue light can be

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.560
 and stylish at the same time.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.640
 My favorite are actually the cat eyes.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.600
 So I like those the best.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:28.280
 Like I could like go to a sock hop. (chuckles)

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:30.080
 (mumbles)

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.080
 So it's cool.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.440
 You can actually be stylish

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.240
 and be blocking the blue light at the same time

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.280
 with Swanwick sleep glasses or schwartz as they're called.

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:41.360
 Now, not just for adults, okay?

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:46.360
 So here I have little, my daughter's little blue blockers.

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:49.160
 Obviously they're gonna be a little small on me.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.320
 In case you want them in blue or pink,

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.640
 they also have pink on the website.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.640
 She likes her purple ones.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:00.640
 So I think if I really wanted to, whoops, I dropped on.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.520
 If I really wanted to get the benefit of blocking

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:07.180
 as much blue light as possible, simply.

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:13.960
 Okay, I think that's really gonna do it as far as, yeah, okay.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.720
 So there you have options.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:20.160
 Now these here, these are the fit overs that fit over.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.080
 Like when I wear my glasses,

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.080
 I'll put these on and they fit over.

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:27.080
 So for people that wear glasses, there's that option.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:30.480
 Then for people that are looking for daylight blocking,

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:33.200
 we have the day blockers in the black.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.120
 But if you don't want the black,

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.600
 then you have the two tone.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.560
 So there's those.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.580
 Can you tell I have a little bit of an addiction

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:42.560
 to blue blockers? (chuckles)

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:45.360
 So while I was making the video, I forgot I had these too.

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:49.080
 So these are kind of like the clear way fares.

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:53.760
 So I literally have, okay, one, two, three, four,

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:58.760
 five, six, seven, seven, eight, well, eight, nine pairs

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.600
 if you count my daughter's two. (chuckles)

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.960
 I have an issue.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:08.960
 swanmuxleep.com, GetFit is the code G-E-T-F-I-T

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:14.760

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.280

 Post below and let me know.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.220
 (upbeat music)

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.800
 (upbeat music)

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.380
 (upbeat music)

01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:27.960
 (upbeat music)

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:30.540
 (upbeat music)
