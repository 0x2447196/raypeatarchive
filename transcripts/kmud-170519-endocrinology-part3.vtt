00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
 Well, welcome to this month's live Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.240
 Sarah is not with us tonight.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.360
 She is well, but she is not with us, so we are doing the show with Dr. Peat as a regular

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:19.640
 guest this evening and continuing the last two months topic of the endocrine system.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.720
 I would like to break at some point during the show and intersperse some questions that

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.520
 we have had from people that have been emailed to us who for one reason or another can't

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.820
 get Dr. Peat by email or whatever, but they are corresponding to me and I am posing these

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.120
 questions this evening.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.320
 And also there is a latest newsletter from Dr. Peat.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.960
 For those of you who don't know, Dr. Peat does a monthly newsletter.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 I think it was bi-monthly.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.860
 Dr. Peat might correct me when he comes on.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.120
 But I think it is a monthly newsletter that he does.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.720
 So for those people as always who are interested in his work, there is lots of information

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.720
 that can be found on the web now.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.920
 I have been amazed at how the web has exploded the availability of knowledge in all areas.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.760
 And Dr. Peat and his discussions with various different people from politics to science

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.440
 and health are available all over the internet as are these broadcast and recorded programs

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.240
 I found on the internet myself.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.200
 I didn't even know they were there up until about a year ago.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.760
 But there is probably 60 or so YouTube shows of this done on the internet.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.000
 So for people that want to hear more and they are titled by topic, you can just go to the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.080
 internet, go to YouTube and type in Dr. Ray Peat or Ray Peat Andrew Murray KMUD.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.400
 And also on our website, I have a full archive up until 2015.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.480
 It's not as full as it could be.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.440
 I've got 2016 and a few of this year's.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.160
 So there's probably another 16 or 17 shows that have yet to get put up.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.600
 I will endeavor to get those done fairly soon.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.160
 For people that haven't really heard about Dr. Peat, we always get new listeners and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.320
 from time to time we get people that don't know anything about what he's advocating.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.600
 And for them, there's plenty of information either on the internet by typing in Dr. Ray

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.160
 Peat or going to our website which is westernbotanicalmedicine.com and looking at the resources tab on the right

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.240
 hand side and dropping it down to askyourherbdoctor.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.400
 And also there's plenty of literature that Dr. Peat has published himself.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.680
 So he does a newsletter and without going on too much about this newsletter, this month's

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.080
 newsletter is right up our street as far as I'm concerned.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:05.080
 It's a kind of continuation and expose of covert but now disclosed somewhat CIA and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:15.000
 other foundational groups that basically, certainly ruling if you like, the top tier

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 of society and molding and coercing the system to follow its edicts and obviously that comes

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.040
 with a lot of tyranny.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.400
 Most people that listen to this show, it's an alternative show, probably agree that there

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.800
 certainly is a tyranny at large and to resist tyranny I think is a call to arms, not necessarily

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.000
 with violence and guns but to resist tyranny by immersing yourself in alternative education

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.920
 and the knowledge of that education is a powerful weapon against the tyrants who would tell

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.920
 us otherwise.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.520
 So Dr. Peat, are you with us?

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520
 >> Yes.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520
 >> Okay.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.080
 Well, thanks so much for your time on the show.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.120
 Like I said, we'll go through what I'd like to ask you about with regards to the endocrine

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.400
 system and then there are some questions posed by callers.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.800
 As always, people who are listening, the number that we open up from 7.30 to 8 p.m. for callers

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.880
 to ask questions directly to Dr. Peat, there's a 800 number which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD and then

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.520
 there's the regular number which I want to make sure has not changed but it's 923-3911

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.680
 so that is the local area code 707 number.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.320
 So 707-923-3911 or if you're out of the area or in Australia, well, not for Australians,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.080
 I guess they can't use the 800 number but they're on the internet so we can be reached

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.720
 through the internet too but there's an 800 number which is 1-800-568-3723 and we take

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.520
 callers from 7.30 on to the end of the show at 8.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:02.840
 So Dr. Peat, I guess without further ado, I saw where we left off last month and we

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:11.240
 just got started into the hypothalamus and I brought out one of the things that struck

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.160
 me as kind of unusual but I wanted to ask you a little bit more about it.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.920
 So from last month breaking the question, what is a hormone and how the endocrine system

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.200
 regulates metabolism, you discussed thyrotropin releasing hormone which stimulates TSH from

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.320
 the anterior pituitary as well as prolactin.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.020
 Now prolactin is a hormone that's responsible for lactation in females and so is there another

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.480
 mechanism perhaps to satisfy the TSH production in low thyroid individuals to upregulate the

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.560
 TSH for production which does not result in increased prolactin production.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.160
 So for those of you who are listening perhaps, the TSH is a thyroid stimulating hormone and

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.840
 this is basically stimulated at the same time as prolactin is.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.920
 So in low thyroid individuals, my question to you Dr. Peat is the potential for women

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.200
 to be exposed to higher than normal levels of prolactin and have you known women that

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.320
 would lactate when they weren't you know nursing or outside of you know, well not outside of

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.640
 menstruation, but when women weren't fertile or nursing.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.800
 Is this something that you've actually found?

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:33.600
 Yeah probably maybe a hundred women that I've talked to who were simply hypothyroidism was

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:46.240
 their basic problem, but unwelcome lactation was just one of their symptoms and usually

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:54.560
 there were menstrual irregularities at the same time, either too much or too little menstruation

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.800
 and just correcting their thyroid function took care of the lactation and menstruation

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:13.320
 both and what it's doing, it's partly regulating oxygen metabolism so that you can use your

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:21.520
 fuel very efficiently, keep your blood sugar steady so that you don't experience stress.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:30.120
 Estrogen is in good health, it's produced for about 12 hours once a month in a big surge

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:39.520
 to basically create tissue stress to stir up cell division to prepare the uterus and

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:51.880
 the breast and other tissues, pituitary are the main things that are activated by estrogen.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:08:08.840
 Low thyroid by letting you get low blood sugar inappropriately, at the same time it's activating

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:17.040
 the stress hormones and inactivating the parts of the liver that are normally destroying

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.640
 estrogen as soon as estrogen reaches the liver.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:29.440
 Normally the small amount of estrogen being produced under moderate stress is kept very

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:37.440
 low by an active liver when the thyroid is activating the liver.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:46.860
 When the thyroid is low, estrogen tends to rise and both of these tend to create an oxygen

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.960
 deficiency and a glucose deficiency.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:09:01.280
 One intensifies the other and these are the first step in any kind of stress reaction

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:12.200
 and the stress reaction turns on your pituitary as a way to organize the adaptive system of

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:22.680
 the body and prolactin in fish, prolactin regulates salt and water metabolism and mammals

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:34.880
 have various components of milk formation involving both the flow of water and salts

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:40.640
 but including proteins and sugar.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:50.120
 So prolactin in all animals has a range of anti-stress functions and lactation is just

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:57.600
 a useful component for handling the stress of pregnancy fertility.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:05.880
 I picked up on what you said about estrogen being a once monthly, a 12-hour period, a

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:14.680
 once monthly surge but I just want to ask you this, it seems a very ubiquitous poison

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:21.720
 for want of a better word that women are continually subjected to.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.880
 How can you compare that to the background levels of estrogen that you are always advising

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:33.560
 women to protect themselves from either environmentally or with things like pregnenolone or progesterone

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:39.760
 if they have excessive inflammation going on in the body for some different causes?

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:45.080
 Any tissue of your body that is stressed will start to produce estrogen.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:55.760
 It's a very basic reaction to stress and so with aging for example, when you've lost some

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:03.320
 of your basic anti-stress hormones, thyroid and progesterone and pregnenolone, then all

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:14.880
 of your tissues are suffering from oxygen and glucose, bad metabolism.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:24.640
 They're simply not interacting properly and that means that all of your tissues will begin

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.440
 producing a little bit of estrogen.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:34.720
 For example, the postmenopausal breast tissue is producing several times more estrogen than

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:46.200
 it does during menstruation and if the liver slows down because the thyroid is low, then

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:52.920
 that little bit that's being produced by any stress tissue is going to pile up in the blood

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.960
 because it should be eliminated constantly through the liver and kidney.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.960
 Interesting.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.320
 This brings me back to some of the reasons for wanting to cover some of this endocrine

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.360
 stuff with you is that I think, and it's a little bit tied into your newsletter funnily

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:14.920
 enough like a lot of things do, in terms of the brainwashing that science has been guilty

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.920
 of brainwashing the public into deceiving them to believe that things are a certain

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.720
 way when actually there's previous research that showed exactly the opposite.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:30.600
 That's been buried, it's been closed up and money's been diverted away from it and diverted

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.400
 towards the wanted information.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.200
 So again, when I was studying, I was under the impression that basically the ovaries

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.360
 were the main estrogen secreting organ in the female body and that really men didn't

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.360
 really have estrogen.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.960
 It wasn't, you know, men had testosterone, females had estrogen.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.920
 Things were fairly simple but actually it's really very different from that and hearing

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.760
 that I think you said any cell can essentially secrete estrogen in response to stress and

00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.760
 inflammation.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:06.640
 Yeah and old men get low testosterone because their stress tissue is turning it quickly

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.640
 into estrogen.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.360
 Right, this is aromatization, right?

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:18.200
 Yeah and a younger man who is very sick or has an accident will have very high estrogen

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:25.920
 and that will bring up usually prolactin and growth hormone and a lot of adaptive secondary

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.920
 hormones.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.080
 Interesting, so I think hopefully by continuing some other little tidbits will come out that

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.480
 people will pick up on and maybe start looking into things further themselves.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.200
 I wanted to again, just to get back briefly to that first question about lactation and

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:47.800
 prolactin being secreted in females and actually causing some milk production.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.800
 I wanted to also ask, is it a quantitative issue or where there's not enough prolactin

00:13:53.800 --> 00:14:01.920
 being stimulated by the release of TRH or is oxytocin for example a more powerful stimulator

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.440
 of lactation or not?

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.200
 Oxytocin really is just to release the milk once it's formed.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.000
 It isn't involved in directly in forming it.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.840
 When I was a little kid during the depression, there were very poor people moving into Southern

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:32.480
 California and some of them were finding jobs and one family we knew, the mother was able

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:39.680
 to find a job when they had a baby that was a few months old and the father, they had

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:46.280
 been starving for years and the father was able to lactate to nurse the baby while the

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.760
 mother was at work.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.000
 Do you see any difference, out of interest, do you see any difference in the quality of

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 the milk?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.120
 Oh sure, men aren't nearly as good at lactating.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.640
 Not as much fat maybe.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.600
 And it's a very extreme thing.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:14.200
 Lots of men when they came out of the World War II prison camps, when they started eating,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:23.120
 they got enough energy to mobilize cortisol and some thyroid and such, they began lactating

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:28.840
 because they had injured their tissues much that they were very high in estrogen.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:35.440
 Wow, I mean it's well documented now, certainly not hidden, that male breasts or gynecomastia

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.240
 is a common phenomenon in males that are exposed to estrogen and from the industry in England,

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:45.760
 the beer drinking, it's not uncommon for men that drink a lot of beer daily to grow basically

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:52.960
 breasts and even in this country, related to estrogen substances, whether it's the hops,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.440
 that the estrogen mimics in hops or even environmental mimics in plastics etc. that get into the

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:06.320
 environment that some more sensitive individuals are being exposed to.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:14.520
 Yeast can produce estradiol, so they think that the yeast for men is a major source of

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.440
 the breast development in beer drinkers.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.080
 Interesting, so it may not necessarily be down to the humulone, lupulone or the other

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.120
 byproducts of the hop?

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:30.800
 Yeah, they're probably not as harmful as the yeast produced estrogen.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:36.240
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Doctor on KMED Garboville 91.1 FM.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.840
 We're joined with Dr. Peat who's on the show basically questioning the endocrine system

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.580
 and what we understand about it and finding out some certain differences and contradictions

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:52.040
 that perhaps people understand the facts by until they hear differently.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.160
 The number if you're in the area is 707-923-3911.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:02.560
 If you're outside the area, I would like to ask Dr. Peat any questions from 7.30 on, there's

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:11.320
 an 800 number which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD which is 1-800-568-3723.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:18.520
 So let's move on to the next hormone in the hypothalamic section of this endocrine discussion,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:27.120
 the corticotropin releasing hormone, how this stimulates adrenocorticotropic hormone from

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:34.360
 the anterior pituitary and this acts on the adrenals to promote and secrete cortisol.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:39.920
 Now most people have probably heard of cortisol if they're at all health-minded, cortisol,

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:45.040
 cortisone, hydrocortisone, they're all kind of derivatives.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:50.720
 Most of these derivatives here have at some point in time and/or are still being used

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:57.880
 to control inflammation and I've known asthmatics and eczema patients and psoriatic patients

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:05.560
 that have been prescribed cortisol and corticosteroids to control that.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:10.740
 The natural production of cortisol is inhibited by negative feedback mechanism so we're never

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:16.200
 normally naturally constantly and chronically exposed to cortisol.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:23.120
 It obviously has some beneficial effect although I understand your interpretation puts a far

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:29.920
 more negative view of cortisol probably in relation to its chronic exposure.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.440
 But what dangers do you see in the chronic use of hydrocortisone either topically or

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.920
 aerosolized and what would be a better approach to quell inflammation than of this type that

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.680
 you're aware of?

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:50.000
 Within the first two or three hours of a big dose of cortisol or the synthetic glucocorticoids,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.760
 the thymus gland starts shrinking and the skin and muscles begin shrinking as the cortisol

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:03.840
 shifts the metabolism in the opposite direction of testosterone.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:09.560
 Towards the estrogenic side?

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:17.400
 Well they activate the proteolytic enzymes that break down the proteins and inhibit the

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.960
 anabolic protein synthesizing mechanisms.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:34.800
 The brain, heart and lungs are very concentrated testosterone metabolizers and retainers.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:44.280
 If you give someone radioactive testosterone, you see the emission from those organs, most

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:51.040
 of it from the heart and the brain, the lungs are so full of air you don't see much radiation.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.500
 But the testosterone is there protecting these vital organs.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:02.800
 But when you give a big dose of cortisol, you swamp that protective effect of progesterone

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:10.200
 and testosterone and the tissues that aren't very well protected very quickly shrink.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:18.440
 Your skin becomes thinner, blood vessels weaken, you tend to get little bloody spots, petechial

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.320
 hemorrhages and bruise very easily.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:32.120
 Lots of women have constantly bruised thighs and sometimes upper arms because if they're

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:39.800
 low in thyroid and progesterone, then they compensate with increased cortisol which weakens

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.760
 their small blood vessels and they bruise easily.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:50.440
 If that continues over the years, it leads to strokes and osteoporosis and the typical

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.920
 aging conditions.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.920
 I've known people in England especially that I don't know whether or not the doctors there

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:05.640
 were just more readily prescribing aerosolized inhalants, corticosteroids inhalants for asthma

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:10.840
 and/or topical creams for eczemas but it was the only thing that was ever really done.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.640
 I've known people that have been on these things for years and years and I'm sure to

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.520
 their detriment.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:25.560
 You're saying it's essentially switching off the protective anti-exciter toxic mechanism

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:33.680
 and route by which inflammation typically or estrogen-induced inflammation is mediated?

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:39.320
 And asthma is one of the typical estrogen-induced inflammation.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:46.200
 High estrogen women are very susceptible to asthma especially during the night and one

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:54.160
 of the effects of estrogen is to directly stimulate the adrenal glands to produce cortisol

00:21:54.160 --> 00:22:02.480
 so high estrogen leads to weak blood vessels and shrinking bones and aging skin and low

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:09.120
 immunity in such a way, shrinking effect of cortisol on the thymus gland.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:21.600
 And estrogen shifts the balance towards serotonin away from dopamine and this shift in the serotonin

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:31.440
 dopamine ratio is one of the things that activates the prolactin system and it also serotonin

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:40.200
 is one of the major activators of the corticotropic release hormone CRH.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:53.600
 So estrogen activates the pituitary, the hypothalamus, the adrenal glands directly to increase the

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.800
 tissue breakdown effect.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:02.280
 Okay, so I caught on what you said about female asthmatics getting particularly worse at night

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:08.960
 and this again I guess this is night time stress that worsens the inflammation?

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:13.000
 All of the stress hormones rise during the night.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.560
 Again in response probably to low blood sugar because of fasting or?

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:28.560
 Yeah, and hypoglycemia or disturbed oxygen availability increase both prolactin and usually

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:33.320
 growth hormone stress induces.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:41.440
 I think all of the pituitary hormones except for luteinizing hormone, the one that produces

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.560
 testosterone and progesterone.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:55.160
 So when you activate all of the other parts of the pituitary, you are likely to become

00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:00.120
 sterile by losing your progesterone and testosterone.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:06.680
 I think from a male perspective, for those males that are listening, I know we do tend

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:14.240
 to get more female listeners that I think intuitively are more nurturing and empathic

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.240
 maybe.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:21.320
 But for the guys that are out there, I think testosterone is extremely important to reiterate

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:27.880
 not just the prostatic involvement with decreased testosterone but to maximize your testosterone

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:33.320
 is the best thing that you can do as a guy because it is the counterpart to estrogen

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:42.160
 and it is the anti-exciter toxic route by which inflammation is quelled and the body

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:48.440
 is governed by an orderly system of growth and sugar metabolism, etc.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:56.000
 It's close enough in function to progesterone in protective tissues.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:04.120
 They've experimented removing the ovaries from rats after they've been impregnated and

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.760
 then giving them testosterone during pregnancy.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:14.400
 It is a progesterone in that sense of being able to sustain pregnancy in the absence of

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.400
 ovaries.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.960
 Well I guess we do actually have a caller.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:24.640
 So I'll pick up this question I wanted to ask you about testosterone for the males that

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:30.480
 are listening just to help them see their way forward through any lack of muscle and

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.360
 muscle building and how testosterone is really very beneficial for you and you can generate

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.360
 it yourself.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.360
 You don't have to buy it, etc.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.360
 So let's take this first caller.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.360
 Caller, you're on the air.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.360
 Where are you from?

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.360
 Hi, I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360
 Okay, hi.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.360
 What's your question?

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:50.560
 I'm wondering can an imbalance of hormones influence someone's perception of his or her

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.560
 gender?

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.960
 I'm curious as I'm certain we're constantly exposed to environmental estrogens and I've

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.480
 also heard of instances like Caitlyn Jenner where Bruce Jenner knew from a very young

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.440
 age that he was the opposite gender.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.160
 So what's your take on that?

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.960
 Dr. Peat?

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:18.840
 When that happens during gestation or in the first few months after being born, the actual

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:29.520
 structure of the brain is still going on and it's either masculinized or not by the presence

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:38.040
 of testosterone which is turned into estrogen and estrogen in those stages of development

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.040
 is the masculinizing hormone.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:49.160
 And so a deficiency of progesterone early in life leaves the estrogen unopposed and

00:26:49.160 --> 00:27:03.840
 tends to masculinize the brain and so it can set up the feeling of the gender that is chemically

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:12.960
 related rather than what the chromosomes were able to do.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.800
 Does that answer your question?

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.680
 That does, thank you.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.680
 You're welcome.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.200
 Okay, well let's see here, we do have another caller.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.040
 So let's take this caller, next caller, you're on the air.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:27.040
 What's your question and where are you from?

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.040
 Yes, good evening.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.040
 I'm calling from Finland.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.040
 Okay, I've finished.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:36.480
 I would have a question.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:46.480
 I've been reading your wonderful Generative Energy book and basically it's prompted me

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:53.200
 to think about what I think they call now transhumanism.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:58.760
 Nowadays we have basically the modern version of the six million dollar man.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:02.200
 We have people with robotic hands.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:08.960
 A friend of mine with Parkinson's disease has two chips implanted in his brain with

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.960
 remote control.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:21.280
 And my question to Dr. Peat would be, do you believe that this transhumanism might fit

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:26.200
 into future evolutions of man?

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:32.280
 You know, I'm referring to this theory about life trending towards maximum metabolism,

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.520
 maximum energy.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.280
 I wonder if you have any thoughts about that.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:51.040
 I think the technology is so simplified compared to what actually is needed by the organism

00:28:51.040 --> 00:29:05.080
 to maximize its metabolism and function and experience that I don't think the technology

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:18.600
 is going to have a role in future development of health, longevity or brain development.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.840
 It's certainly not going to be passed on to the next generation so it's certainly a very

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.840
 temporal thing.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:28.720
 And I think from my perspective the human body, I think the psyche plays a much bigger

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:35.280
 part in the protection and the development of the human organism far more than perhaps

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.800
 people give real credit to for positive thinking, etc. etc.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:44.560
 Self-empowerment, doing the right thing in terms of everything that you propose in terms

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:50.000
 of nutrition and/or some of the few supplements that you recommend, things like thyroid and

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.540
 progesterone and things that protect the anti-inflammatory side, I think we have a far better chance

00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:01.040
 of living a genetically very healthy life and something that I think that can be passed

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.160
 on to next generations.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:08.320
 Certainly we hear about in utero effects onto the fetus.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:14.480
 I'm fairly interested about the transhumanism subject with, like the callers mentioned,

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:20.560
 things like robotic replacements and/or chips to secrete or to prompt secretion of neuropeptides,

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.800
 etc. etc. into the brain or other areas.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.520
 But it doesn't continue, it's a very temporal thing.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.640
 I don't think it's something that can ever be transmitted but what can be transmitted

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:40.600
 is a mental state of mind that is based on positive thinking, creating that in harmony

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:47.680
 and whether it's yoga or doing exercise and getting outside and just appreciating everything

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:52.640
 that you have around you rather than looking at negative things which I do hear people

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:57.600
 calling about from time to time in terms of help with negative emotions and how it's actually

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.360
 one of the questions, funnily enough, later on in the show.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.360
 But this is something that can be...

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.360
 Can I ask a follow-up question?

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.040
 Go ahead, yeah.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:13.240
 I was wondering about, because this is a topic that I haven't heard on the show yet, but

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:19.680
 we're also in an increasingly hairless society.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.200
 People want to shave more and more of their bodies more and more regularly.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:28.440
 How stressful is frequent shaving to the body in your opinion?

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.440
 It's interesting you say that.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.400
 I'll just jump in there, Dr. Peat, before I let you answer.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.760
 But I read the article just a couple of days ago, it was actually on the Drudge Report.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:42.400
 It was that the increasing hairiness of females is actually becoming recognized in polls.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.280
 I think they did a poll in 2004, I think 95% of females shaved.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.880
 They did a recent poll here.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.280
 I think it was down to 78 and they were saying that essentially there was more...

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.360
 Au naturale was becoming more normal.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:59.680
 Whether or not you're talking about the hair on a male's head from a baldness perspective,

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.680
 I don't know, Caller.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.600
 But Dr. Peat, what do you think about the...

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:11.880
 I think the hair on the head actually has the function of preserving heat, helping to

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.720
 keep the brain warm.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:21.800
 Wearing a wool hat will substitute somewhat for not having enough hair on the head.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:30.760
 And the other hair, armpits and pubic hair, I think that has the function of helping to

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.800
 distribute pheromones.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:43.320
 But the facial hair and the arm hair probably has that pheromone distributing function.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:52.240
 But I think the body hair that is tending to appear more often in women is a sign of

00:32:52.240 --> 00:33:05.680
 stress that it's probably related to that pheromone system shifting to an exaggerated

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.480
 steroid production in the skin.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.480
 Okay, thanks for your call, Caller.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.720
 Thanks for the show.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.720
 Yeah, you're welcome.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.720
 Thanks for calling in.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:19.200
 For people that want to call in with any questions, if you're in the area, 923 3911, that's a

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:26.920
 call, 923 3911, or if you're outside somewhere in the States or even in a different country,

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.920
 1-800-KMUD-RAD, 1-800-568-3723.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:36.640
 So, Dr. Peat, just to carry on with testosterone a little bit, it's a bit of a divergent question,

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:41.800
 but in terms of men being able to maximize their testosterone production without thinking

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:47.360
 they have to go to the gym and get aerobic and pump huge amounts of weights to build

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:55.400
 muscle, what would you say would be a good program for a male who wanted to increase

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.720
 lean muscle mass in order to be exposed to more testosterone because it's the muscle

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:06.640
 itself that actually promotes a testosterone surge in the body and by its own mechanism

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.960
 will directly relate back to testosterone itself?

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:17.840
 Yeah, muscle contraction activates the synthesis locally in the muscle of testosterone and

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.520
 decreases the cortisol activity.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:31.720
 So good physical work is probably the central thing to keeping your testosterone up.

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:37.240
 It shouldn't be episodic, intense, stressful work.

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:43.680
 That is known to lower your testosterone and increase cortisol.

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:50.800
 At the same time, keeping your metabolic rate up so that you can do more intense activity

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.320
 without it being stressful.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:59.880
 Having your liver very healthy is essential for keeping your testosterone up because otherwise

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:08.560
 the episodes of falling blood sugar activate cortisol, estrogen, all of the other stress

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.560
 hormones.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:14.160
 Okay, so stocking your liver with plenty of sugar, not being aerobic about your approach

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:22.720
 to exercise and ideally having more of a kind of work approach that is a physical type of

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.600
 work if you're possibly able.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:31.080
 So moving on to dopamine, I wanted to ask you a little bit.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:37.080
 I know we've mentioned the discussion related to Parkinson's and Parkinsonism.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:43.180
 We said that this dopamine itself inhibits prolactin release and helps regulate emotional

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:48.320
 responses and the reward and pleasure response is something I wanted to ask you about.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.120
 This enables a person not only to see the rewards but to take action to move towards

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:58.360
 them and lack of dopamine has been cited and implicated in the propensity to addiction.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:03.080
 If you want to feel better and mood enhancing drugs are a route to this, does this imply

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.640
 that many addicts have naturally low levels of dopamine and may develop Parkinson's type

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.200
 symptoms in the future?

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:15.280
 And would dopamine supplementation be useful to wean addicts or prevent addictive behaviors

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.480
 from developing?

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:29.200
 I think that even in Parkinson's disease, I think the studies are moving towards thinking

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.320
 of a balance between serotonin and dopamine and the other symptoms.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.440
 So you're thinking of serotonin excess?

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.440
 Yeah.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.440
 Yeah.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.800
 They are somewhat antagonistic.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:51.400
 For example, serotonin increases the CRH and prolactin, dopamine tends to inhibit them.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:58.400
 So a bad bowel function or poor elimination would certainly speed that serotonin excess

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.400
 up.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.400
 Yes.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:08.760
 Nitric oxide, endotoxin and serotonin all shift your body towards the stress and progesterone

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:16.600
 and its derivatives in the brain, allopregnenolone for example, are important for keeping the

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.880
 balance in the right direction.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:26.960
 Estrogen increases the serotonin and stress, progesterone tends to reverse that and increase

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.560
 the balance towards dopamine.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:36.480
 So do you think though that this would be any reason or cause for Parkinson's down the

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:43.720
 road though, perhaps if people have addictive natures, if it is at all connected with lack

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.200
 of dopamine?

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:55.080
 Well, I think you can correct it most safely with progesterone and testosterone or the

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.720
 precursor of both of those, pregnenolone.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:08.840
 Because when you try to push the dopamine system, you tend to increase oxidative damage

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:16.760
 and it is safe to work at the anti-stress level rather than pushing the end product

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.760
 of dopamine.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.760
 Got it.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:27.640
 So improved muscle mass, plenty of sugars, then obviously pregnenolone thyroid, all helpful

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.080
 and anti-inflammatory aspects.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:35.760
 And keeping the toxic fats down and sugar stable.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:41.680
 Okay, so can I ask you about growth hormone?

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:47.720
 So the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulates growth hormone release from the pituitary

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:52.680
 again, from the anterior pituitary and this has regulatory effects on protein, carbohydrate

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:57.400
 and lipid metabolism as well as promoting slow wave sleep, often referred to as deep

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.400
 sleep.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:06.640
 I know people that perhaps have sleep issues where they're unable to get into that phase

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.640
 of deep sleep.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:13.640
 I did read that the slow wave sleep was apparently, but I know this is not particularly true because

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:19.720
 I know you think it's very much related to low blood glucose, but the slow wave sleep

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:28.440
 was implicated in nightmares and sleepwalking, especially when sleepwalking was joined to

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.440
 raiding the fridge at night and to eat.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.720
 I found that quite a bizarre connection, but I think it's well known in popular culture.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:44.720
 I've even seen, I remember an old advert back in 1970 for R. White's lemonade and the advert

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.680
 was more or less this person was getting out of bed and was sleepwalking downstairs to

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:51.360
 the fridge where he'd go open the fridge door and there'd be a bottle of R. White's lemonade

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:54.240
 and he would sit there drinking it and his wife would come down and say, "What's going

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.240
 on?"

00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:03.200
 But anyway, between the desire to eat, sleepwalk and growth hormone, do you think the deep

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:12.920
 sleep that it relates to is in any way, do you think this is a real subject or do you

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.000
 think this has been again mismanaged scientifically?

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:28.040
 No, I think deep sleep is important as a restorative part of your brain function and I think a lot

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:35.120
 of people would be happier and healthier if they would eat during the night.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:46.560
 People who resist eating near bedtime or during the night often have more stress, more hypoglycemic

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:55.200
 insomnia, and most people can get back to sleep if they have, it could be orange juice

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.480
 or lemonade or milkshake or ice cream.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:04.280
 It's almost a cultural barrier where there's this feeling that if you eat close to bedtime

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.520
 you're just going to put it on as fat.

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:11.920
 I think I've certainly heard that doctrine that excess carbohydrates are stored as fat

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:18.200
 which I don't know that it's completely inaccurate but the nighttime stress that is achieved

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.240
 by lowering your blood glucose is probably offset by the very fact that you're going

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.560
 to consume some glucose before you sleep.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:30.520
 It's very important to restore your glycogen level during sleep.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:37.080
 I think that's one of the main purposes of sleep is to get the glycogen back into your

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:46.320
 brain cells and heart cells and other tissues so that you can expand it to resist stress

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.320
 during the daytime.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:53.120
 Okay, let me just move on to a few questions that I know people have written in that wanted

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.000
 to get your take on this.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.320
 I had two questions for one listener.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:04.080
 One of the questions goes, "Did Jimmy Carter's cancer cure have anything to do with receptors?

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.920
 Isn't the entire cell a receptor?"

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:16.400
 I think he was having standard chemotherapy for a while and then brain radiation and then

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:29.320
 he got this new antibody that is specific for allowing cells to undergo the normal apoptosis.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:43.320
 So statistically, it doesn't look like it was a terribly impressive cure because the

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:49.120
 number of people studied was not very big and the percentage who responded well, I think

00:42:49.120 --> 00:43:01.760
 it was 24%, had a temporary regression of the tumors and that happened in a lot of the

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.640
 people who had only the preceding brain radiation.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.040
 Okay, all right.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:13.200
 The other question, I wonder that it might be a little bit self-explanatory perhaps,

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:18.400
 but it says, "Since gums like carrageenan and xanthan gum are toxic, does the same apply

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:22.520
 to gums like frankincense and myrrh?"

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:29.480
 The carrageenan and xanthan are basically polysaccharides.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:39.120
 The carrageenan is a sulfated polysaccharide and I think all of the sulfated polysaccharides

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:48.760
 besides their own heparin, I think all of those are toxic and dangerous and the xanthan

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:58.680
 gums and gum arabic and lots of the plant gums are not digestible but they can support

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.720
 bacterial growth in the intestine.

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:08.640
 Where the carrageenan is specifically pro-inflammatory and very dangerous, the other gums are simply

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:17.120
 nuisances that tend to increase bacterial growth and gas production and such.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:27.440
 Where the frankincense and myrrh contain lots of anti-inflammatory substances, probably

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:37.360
 anti-cancer effects, some steroid-like molecules, not so different from testosterone and progesterone.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:45.800
 They seem to have an anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferation effect on cancer cells.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:51.360
 I wasn't aware of myrrh being used internally but I've known frankincense for a long time,

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.760
 especially by the Bedouins.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:57.680
 They'll chew frankincense straight off the tree in the pearls that it comes formed in

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:03.560
 when it dries to freshen their breath and as a kind of bacteria static for their teeth

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.120
 and their mouth.

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:13.240
 I've heard of people eating the crude gum ground up just by the spoonful.

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:23.400
 On the issue of receptors, there are actual proteins that are called receptor proteins

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:32.760
 but my position is that since the condition of the cell determines what a particular substance

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:42.280
 binding to that receptor is going to do to the cell, it isn't as meaningful as some people

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:49.320
 think to activate a receptor because it can have opposite effects depending on the history

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.160
 of the cell and the present condition of other cells.

00:45:53.160 --> 00:46:00.200
 While we're talking about cells, just quickly, what's your view on stem cell technology?

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:05.160
 Do you think it's a real way forward to turn around degenerative processes?

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.000
 What do you think about stem cells?

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:14.760
 Yeah, I think we're full of stem cells and what we have to do is activate them intelligently.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.840
 Do you think the research is going in the right direction?

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:20.760
 You probably know more about what is actually being conducted in some of these experiments

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:26.000
 and see if it's actually reasonably positable to bring about something positive.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:33.960
 Yeah, finding out exactly what the kind of stress signal is that activates them.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:43.640
 It's already known that many types of stress will activate the maturing of stem cells and

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:50.960
 that things like progesterone and testosterone, once they have been activated, will keep them

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:58.600
 going in the right direction so that they replace tissues rather than replacing cancer.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:06.000
 When they kill cancer by radiation or chemotherapy or surgery, the cancer tends to come back

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:12.800
 even though they remove the tumor completely because the place where the cancer was has

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:19.240
 been injured and it calls out to the body for stem cells to repair the damage.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:27.560
 Having damaged itself as a framework, it misdirects the stem cells so they develop into cancer.

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.680
 We have a caller that's just called in.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.240
 So let's take this next caller.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:35.000
 Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.720
 Hi, my name is Derek.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.520
 I'm here in Denver, Colorado.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.520
 Can you hear me okay?

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.520
 Yeah, yeah, sounds great.

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.520
 What's your question, Derek?

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:50.000
 Well, first off, I just discovered this show not too long ago and it's fantastic.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:56.920
 I really appreciate you taking your time to do this for the public.

00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:05.120
 So I've been into nutrition research for the last, I don't know, last five years or so

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:15.160
 and looking into, I've had a lot of food intolerances and looking into like permeability and I'm

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:25.040
 curious, Dr. Peat, your take on, because a lot of these protocols involve avoiding otherwise

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:33.120
 really nutrient-dense foods, eggs, dairy, etc.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:42.080
 So I'm curious, I've looked into controlling endotoxin through various polyphenols.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:49.960
 I know you talk about the carrot salad and bamboo shoots, but is there any other compounds

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:55.640
 you like to incorporate to heal or strengthen the lining of the intestines?

00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:02.080
 I know gelatin can be beneficial.

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:12.320
 The nutrients that are most important are magnesium and vitamin A, just for the actual

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:21.680
 replacement and repair of cells, but the whole range of nutrients, protein, zinc, vitamin

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:31.160
 D, anti-inflammatory things like vitamin E and vitamin K, everything is really essential

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.240
 ultimately for protecting the intestines.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:44.240
 So having liver and eggs and milk and orange juice, for example, can often get the repair

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.240
 going.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:55.720
 I think the reason eggs have a bad reputation is that they are extremely concentrated protein

00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:01.520
 and if a person eats an egg or two without carbohydrate, their blood sugar is going to

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:07.800
 fall for sure, especially if their liver doesn't have good glycogen stores.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:13.640
 The egg will drop their blood sugar, that will activate mast cells and you'll have allergic

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:20.280
 reactions.

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:28.520
 Without the carbohydrate, you're going to increase inflammation and sugar and progesterone

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:36.080
 and aspirin are things that will protect you from those surges of histamine and serotonin,

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.080
 etc.

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:45.000
 And does the histamine get produced because you don't have enough glycogen due to a cortisol

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.560
 spike then?

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:58.080
 Well, low thyroid ultimately is the most common reason for not having enough glycogen stored

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:06.800
 and the cortisol weakens the tissues so that even though it helps get your blood sugar

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:12.640
 up and momentarily protects the glycogen, in the long run, it's adding to the problem

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:15.960
 of unstable blood sugar.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:22.600
 And anytime your blood sugar falls, the mast cells are likely to degranulate and that's

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:32.160
 influenced by a lack of testosterone and progesterone or an excess of estrogen.

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:39.680
 And am I correct in understanding that thyroid is often times or lack of thyroid hormone

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:50.200
 is often times a root cause of small bowel overgrowth or SIBO which can be a root cause

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.160
 of leaky gut?

00:51:52.160 --> 00:52:00.440
 Your digestion slows down when your metabolic rate slows down from hypothyroidism and so

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:05.960
 your stomach becomes sluggish, doesn't secrete much and doesn't move fast enough.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:11.560
 People might have cancer time, they might eat a carrot today and it might not come out

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.120
 for four or five days.

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:22.040
 That's what happens with hypothyroidism and speeding up your digestion and secretions,

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:30.840
 it should be so active streaming fluid from your stomach and pancreas and liver should

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:40.040
 wash your whole small intestine clean so that no bacteria can thrive in it.

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:49.360
 And Dr. Peat real quick, I don't want to hold you up too long, is there a good quality nutrition

00:52:49.360 --> 00:53:01.440
 based textbook that you find favorable that kind of gets into good mechanisms with nutrition

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:06.640
 and hormones and their relation?

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.840
 Not that I know of.

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:09.840
 You can.

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.840
 I know, that's tricky.

00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:17.200
 I mean I know there's some great online databases for some good research that's put out there

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.640
 but I just didn't know if you had a recommendation there.

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:23.680
 I really appreciate your time.

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:32.000
 Years ago I've seen some really good monographs on particular topics like how the intestine

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.840
 works, how the digestive glands work and so on but I don't know of one that has put everything

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:39.840
 together.

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:40.840
 Sure, sure, sure.

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:44.160
 Well I guess that's part of the journey.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.760
 Thank you so much, I appreciate your time.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.760
 Yeah, you're welcome.

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:53.000
 If you want to email me, my email address is andrew@westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 We've produced a pretty comprehensive three or four page breakdown of those things that

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.040
 Dr. Peat definitely advocates and those things he definitely doesn't advocate so that's certainly

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.960
 been very useful in guiding a lot of our clients to a better place.

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.800
 Dr. Peat, thank you so much for joining us again.

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:12.040
 Okay, thank you.

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:15.840
 For those people who perhaps like the last caller have never really listened to Dr. Peat

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:21.960
 but just discovered him recently, he can be found on the internet at www.raypeat.com.

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:33.320
 He has lots of archived and referenced material so most of the, most if not all of the articles

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:38.920
 that he writes are fully referenced and they range in broad terms from thyroid to sugar

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.920
 to progesterone, epto-diabetes.

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:47.880
 I mean it covers a wide range of situations and gives you the scientific rationale behind

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.080
 why he's advocating what he's advocating.

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:55.360
 So it's not just flippant off the top of his head, it's based on a lot of research and

00:54:55.360 --> 00:55:01.880
 based on a lot of previous good science which unfortunately is becoming fairly bad science

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:08.080
 today and if we get time next month, we'll get into the newsletter that he's produced.

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:11.840
 It's titled "Language and Criticism of Science".

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:18.320
 We've done quite a few exposes of whether it's Codex Alimentarius after the Second World

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:27.080
 War and the development of the global corporate structure which would squat on our necks to

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:34.080
 this discourse that Dr. Peat has outlined in his newsletter mentioning people, organizations

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:39.460
 such as the CIA and the CCF and the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations all basically being in

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.460
 on it.

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:44.560
 We'll get into that next month but for those people who want to find out more about him,

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:51.360
 raypeat.com, we can always be reached Monday through Friday, toll free number is 1-888-WBMERB

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:59.000
 or it can be emailed Andrew or Sarah at westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.480
 So next month, we hope to be here.

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:08.320
 I don't have any plans but I may or may not end up getting off to England but based on

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:12.400
 the fact that I'll be here, it's going to be already the solstice, it's already going

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.400
 to be upon us.

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:17.520
 So this will be the last month of increasing day length.

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:21.600
 So between here and the next couple of months, you've got a chance to get exposed to lots

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:27.400
 of sunshine, get that anti-inflammatory red light, get your vitamin D going, make sure

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:31.120
 you're drinking plenty of milk, getting plenty of sugar, fruit juices at night time, keep

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:35.560
 your stress hormones down, look at your temperature and pulses, see how your thyroid is doing

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.560
 and address it.

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.720
 It's certainly a very simple way of putting things right.

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:44.560
 So between your thyroid and anti-inflammatory hormones and get your testosterone up guys,

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:49.160
 it certainly puts you in a better place, alright, and it's all pretty much free of charge,

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.160
 you know.

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:53.360
 Okay, so thanks for joining us and we'll speak to you next month.
