00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Thank you and welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 My name is Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.500
 they run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8 p.m.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
 And we are both licensed medical herbalists who train in England

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.500
 and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.500
 and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.500
 And this month we are again very pleased and fortunate to welcome Dr. Ray Peat

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 back to the show and we will be discussing the 10 most toxic things in our food.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 So welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor, Dr. Ray Peat.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Hello, thank you.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Okay, I think what I should start by doing is opening up this show

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 and just ask you to mention your academic background for those people who perhaps have never heard you.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.500
 Okay, I used to teach linguistics and literature and such,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 but I got interested in nutrition and other parts of biology, endocrinology and such.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.500
 So I went back to graduate school in 1968.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:22.000
 I got a Ph.D. taking most of my coursework in biochemistry and reproductive physiology.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:32.500
 So it's mostly endocrine chemistry that I've been studying ever since.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.500
 So for the last 45 years, Dr. Peat has been doing nutritional counseling

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.500
 in reproductive physiology and hormones, specializing in hormones.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.000
 Is that correct, Dr. Peat?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.500
 Yes.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:56.000
 I was doing it somewhat in the early 60s, just from what I could learn incidentally

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 without actually taking coursework in it.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Wow, so we have a very experienced nutritionist, physiologist, endocrinologist joining us tonight, Dr. Ray Peat.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 We're very happy to have you on our show tonight.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.500
 Okay, I think what we wanted to go over this week for those people who've just tuned in

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.500
 are the 10 most toxic things in our food.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.500
 Incidentally, I would say probably 50% of our interaction with clients consulting with us

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.500
 is based on their diet and changing their diet, modifying their diet

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.500
 in terms of getting them to cut out eating those foods that are negatively impacting their health

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.000
 and encourage them to switch to other foods that are positively affecting their health.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.500
 And probably the other 50% is herbs and/or other preparations.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.000
 So diet is very important. I think that adage, "You are what you eat" is very appropriate.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.500
 And so for tonight's show, people that are listening, you should probably take note.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.500
 In England, there are very descriptive ingredients on all the foods that you'll buy.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.500
 It almost seems a bit ridiculous sometimes when you look at the wrapper of some foods

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.500
 because there's such a lot of information about the ingredients

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:24.500
 that it almost covers up the packets and the kind of advertising they're trying to do for the food.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.000
 But it's very good. It lets people know exactly what ingredients are in the product.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Everything has to be disclosed.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.500
 And I think that the thing that will come out tonight when we cover the 10 products

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.500
 that are known to cause, I would say, disease or symptoms in people that may lead to disease,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.000
 these things are very easy to spot on packaging in England.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.500
 Whereas in America, there certainly is in the legislation allowable,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.000
 what I would say, non-disclosure of certain ingredients.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.500
 And Dr. Peat, when we go through these ingredients, you can perhaps expand on some of those things

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.000
 that are allowable by law to be included and not be detailed on the ingredient packaging.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.500
 So I know one of the main things that has come to light

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:24.500
 are the ever-increasing processing agents used in foods to the point now where food,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.000
 if you want to call it food in some cases, can be basically broken down into a soup,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 re-homogenized, put into molds, pressed and formed into a certain type of food.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.500
 And this is becoming, I would almost say, an art, not in the sense of being creative or artistic for itself,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.000
 but for the sake of selling a product and turning a pretty non-edible food

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.500
 into an apparently edible and apparently good for you food.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:06.500
 So the transglutaminases are a group of compounds that basically meet glue, if you like.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:13.000
 So these are the agents that will bind meats together.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.500
 So Dr. Peat, I know you have a lot of experience with the things that we're going to mention tonight,

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.500
 so I'd be very pleased if you would talk a little about the transglutaminases,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.500
 what they do and their negative impacts on the foods that they're found in.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:41.500
 Celiac disease has been pretty much explained as an overlap between part of the gluten protein molecule

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:49.000
 and a natural enzyme that we have in all of our cells and systems, the transglutaminase,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 which sticks proteins together.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 And this is induced by lots of things to increase its quantity or decrease it.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 For example, the ACE inhibitors for treating blood pressure have been discovered to block it

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.500
 to the extent that people's skin can fall off.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:23.500
 The epidermis separates and forms blisters and comes loose because of inhibiting the transglutaminase.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:29.500
 But other things can intensify the action.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:39.500
 Estrogen, for example, will cause premature hardening of the epidermis.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:51.500
 The cells are flattened and keratinized under the influence of estrogen, which is antagonized by vitamin A.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:07:04.500
 The uterus and the skin and the breast are places that especially involve these interactions of the hardening enzyme.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:16.500
 And breast cancer and uterine cancer contain very large amounts of overproduction of the transglutaminase of certain kinds.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:35.500
 And the antibody reactions that are involved in celiac disease can inactivate the natural enzyme when it occurs.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:47.500
 For example, scleroderma, the hardening and calcification of the skin and other membranes,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:08:01.500
 can apparently overlap considerably with celiac disease involving over activation of the transglutaminase enzyme.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:09.500
 Would you say that being related to estrogen that females would be at greater risk?

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:19.500
 Yes. All of the autoimmune diseases are much more frequent, five or ten times for some of them, in women compared to men.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:25.500
 And I'm not sure how big a role transglutaminase plays in those,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:36.500
 but that is one enzyme that is very susceptible to forming autoantibodies under the influence of estrogen.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.500
 These autoantibodies would be directed at attacking self.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.500
 Yes.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:50.500
 So typically, what kind of foods will contain larger than normal amounts of these transglutaminases?

00:08:50.500 --> 00:09:01.500
 Well, the worst thing about the use of these products is that they are industrially manufactured in microorganisms,

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:15.500
 genetically modified. And for, I guess, about 30 years now, organisms have been used for modifying foods.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:27.500
 And when the Japanese pioneered the genetic modification of microorganisms to produce amino acids,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.500
 people were thinking they were buying a pure chemical substance.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:45.500
 But I ran across many people who said that they believed they almost died when they took a pure amino acid preparation.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:10:01.500
 And it's extremely difficult, if not impossible, to thoroughly purify anything made in a microorganism to the extent that it won't be allergenic.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:08.500
 So the worst thing is that you're getting junk from microorganisms and industrial processes.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.500
 And these can't be removed? Well, they're very difficult to remove.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.500
 Yeah, as far as I know, it's impossible to absolutely purify them,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.500
 but they purify them enough to satisfy government regulations.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:29.500
 So they're taking bacteria, fungi, and yeast and genetically engineering them

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.500
 and genetically modifying them to produce various chemicals.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:38.500
 And the transglutaminases are one of these things that get produced through genetic modification.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:54.500
 Yeah, and they're becoming more and more popular with restaurant chefs to prepare things individually rather than industrially.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:11:02.500
 Yes, there was a very interesting article you sent us that was talking about the chefs wrapping chicken with bacon.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:09.500
 And if they just applied a little bit of this meat glue, the bacon conveniently stuck to the little bit of chicken breast.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.500
 So they didn't have to use skewers or other.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.500
 And they're getting very skillful.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:28.500
 For example, soybean protein can be shaped and modified and glued together to resemble even the fibrous texture of meat.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:38.500
 And scraps that are salvaged from the slaughterhouse can be glued together to look like meat.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:48.500
 And they can form it so that it looks like specific lamb chop cuts or pork chops or rib steaks or whatever.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.500
 And they're very good, convincing copies.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.500
 They don't want to waste anything.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:12:02.500
 If they can find a byproduct or a waste product and turn it into a product, that's good for business, isn't it?

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:16.500
 Probably where most people are exposed to the transglutamines would be in the chicken or fish chunks that are very neatly formed to a certain shape.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:31.500
 Or in delicatessen, they have a so-called roast beef or roast turkey that comes in very symmetrical tubes or lobes.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:37.500
 Well, most of us here in Humboldt County -- no, I don't know if I can say most of us in Humboldt and Mindo --

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:43.500
 but fortunately in California we are blessed with a lot more natural food stores.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.500
 But still, it's very prevalent.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:51.500
 These delicatessen meats are very prevalent in the stores in California and throughout the United States.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:58.500
 Even though they might be eaten in greater quantities throughout the rest of the U.S., it's quite frightening.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:06.500
 So basically the pressed meats, any meat that appears in a delicatessen that's been pressed into a certain shape

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.500
 and doesn't look as though it was off an animal in that way.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.500
 I know what you're saying.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.500
 They do look very different.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.500
 You may not notice it until you start looking at it properly,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.500
 but they're the kind of meats that will be pressed together and then sliced conveniently.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.500
 Or the chicken nuggets or the fish sticks.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:34.500
 I think some of the lobes that have been around for a hundred years or more, for example, head cheese,

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:39.500
 natural gelatin was traditionally used to make a loaf out of that.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.500
 So that would be fine.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.500
 Right.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.500
 That's the way it was, and unfortunately it's been changed.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.500
 So just to recap on these transglutaminases, Dr. Peat,

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:55.500
 they're something that our body manufactures naturally and they have a purpose,

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:01.500
 but when we take them in increased numbers through these processed foods, is that when it starts to cause a problem?

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.500
 Yeah.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:10.500
 Everything that we eat or inhale is processed by our immune system,

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:18.500
 sampling things that hit the intestinal membranes or that leak through the membrane into the bloodstream.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:26.500
 And so the immune system has to decide what to do to these extraneous materials,

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:38.500
 and it can either accept them and allow them to circulate or it can organize a defensive attack against them.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:51.500
 And it's the defensive inflammatory attack against the extraneous materials such as microorganism proteins

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:58.500
 that can trigger the sometimes deadly allergic reactions.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:10.500
 And it isn't strictly the proteins. The immunologist doctrine used to say that it's proteins which are the allergens,

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:18.500
 but many carbohydrates or starch-like gum materials are extremely allergenic,

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:28.500
 and that has actually been known for 60 or 70 years, but allergists are just now barely accepting the fact.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:33.500
 Okay. You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMU DeGarboville, 91.1 FM,

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:38.500
 and from 7.30 or so until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:43.500
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic of the 10 most toxic things in our food.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.500
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.500
 My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:51.500
 We are joined by guest speaker Dr. Ray Peat, endocrinologist, biochemist and physiologist.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.500
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.500
 Or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:04.500
 I just want to quickly, before we move on to the next food product or additive, Dr. Peat,

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.500
 could you just quickly mention the health benefits of gelatin?

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:12.500
 We mentioned the pressed meats and the use of transglutaminase to achieve that,

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.500
 but gelatin was always used, and the gelatin's a very good product for you.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.500
 Would you just say a few words about gelatin?

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:25.500
 Yeah, gelatin constitutes about 50% of the protein in an animal,

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:34.500
 and it has the feature of lacking tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine,

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:43.500
 which muscle meats, for example, are extremely rich in tryptophan and cysteine and methionine.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:52.500
 Those happen to inhibit the thyroid function, suppress metabolism, and promote inflammation.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:17:00.500
 Simply eliminating methionine, just one of those from the diet in animal experiments,

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.500
 has increased the maximum lifespan about 40%.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:12.500
 Adults have an extremely low requirement for tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.500
 They're used for growth processes.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.500
 So it's very important for children.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:26.500
 Yeah, so they're essential for kids to grow up, but once you've achieved your growth,

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:37.500
 you just need a very small amount to make new skin and antibodies and intestinal membranes and hair and nails.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:44.500
 But you don't need the vast quantities that we get in the ordinary average proteins.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.500
 So an adult, 40 or 50 years ago,

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:56.500
 nutritionists wondered how little old ladies could be so healthy just eating gelatin and toast

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:04.500
 because they thought of tryptophan and cysteine as essential amino acids,

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:13.500
 but old people can essentially live on it with just a trace of the others in things like bread and fruit.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.500
 Right, good.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.500
 Okay, so just another reminder for people that,

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.500
 I think probably because it just helps reinforce in my own mind,

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.500
 I think this kind of conditioning that gelatin is a bad product,

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:29.500
 it's created from animal parts and these animal parts are not the things that shouldn't be in our diet,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.500
 but it's actually the reverse and actually gelatin is extremely important.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:39.500
 Traditional diets made very efficient use of things like chicken feet,

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:45.500
 pig's ears and tails, beef and pork skin and so on.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.500
 Really very pleasant and nutritious foods.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:55.500
 And there have been studies showing the anti-cancer effect of gelatin as well.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.500
 Yeah, anti-aging and anti-inflammatory.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:06.500
 It was used medically very widely up until about 50 years ago.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.500
 Okay, very good.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:12.500
 Let's move on to the next food subject so we can try and get through as many of these as we can

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.500
 before the phones start ringing.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:20.500
 So how about, gosh, I say additive number two on the list, citric acid and ascorbic acid,

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:27.500
 the common ingredients that you'll find perhaps on juices, especially orange juice.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:35.500
 I started running into people who had mysterious allergies in Eugene.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:46.500
 They tend to start with the pollen season and then continue with the grass seed field burning in the later summer.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:55.500
 Allergies were extremely common in Eugene, but I found that some people had year-round allergies

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:07.500
 and they were consistently taking all of the anti-allergy supplements, panacinic acid, vitamin A, vitamin C and so on.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:14.500
 And I suggested that they try stopping those for a while to see what happens.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:22.500
 And I got essentially 100% results in curing the local allergies

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.500
 and that was when I started doing a lot of nutrition counseling

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:34.500
 because everyone was so surprised to see that they had been allergic to the supplement.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:42.500
 And ascorbic acid, that caused me to investigate the history of it.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:55.500
 In 1953, when I worked in the woods, the word went around that you could cure poison oak with ascorbic acid.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.500
 And I tried it myself and in just two or three days,

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:07.500
 I completely recovered from a horrible case of poison oak and never caught it again.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:18.500
 At that time, it was very expensive to make and the pills on sale were only 50 milligrams.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:24.500
 Several years later, they developed new ways of manufacturing it.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:37.500
 One of the processes Linus Pauling described as the lead room for making sulfuric acid,

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:44.500
 which is then the sulfuric acid is slightly contaminated with lead and other heavy metals.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:52.500
 Then the cornstarch is processed, oxidized with this industrial sulfuric acid

00:21:52.500 --> 00:22:00.500
 and ends up as ascorbic acid containing quite a bit of heavy metals.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:09.500
 And with these new methods, I found that when people were taking 500 or 1000 milligrams,

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:17.500
 they would often develop cold symptoms when they took it rather than when they didn't take it.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:26.500
 And it apparently is irritating enough to the intestine that it causes endotoxin absorption

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:32.500
 and inflammation of the nose and throat and chest membranes.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:41.500
 And citric acid is manufactured by very similar methods to ascorbic acid.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:51.500
 And they really shouldn't be considered to have anything to do with the natural ascorbic acid or citric acid.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:58.500
 A person who can get very sick on 2 milligrams of synthetic ascorbic acid

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:05.500
 can eat 4000 milligrams of natural ascorbic acid with no reaction at all.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.500
 I think that's a very important point.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.500
 Actually, even though they might call it the same product,

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:15.500
 the industrial manufacture of it produces a very different effect.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:24.500
 One researcher dissolved a 500 milligram tablet of commercial ascorbic acid in a liter of water

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:29.500
 and then put it in a machine that measures free radicals.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:34.500
 And he said it was like a storm of free radicals.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.500
 He said it's amazing.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:48.500
 It was equivalent to something like 600 rads of x-rays would take to produce that many free radicals in the water.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:54.500
 And here people are taking vitamin C for its antioxidant effect.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.500
 Yeah. He said it shows what tremendous antioxidant systems we have in our stomachs

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:05.500
 that can't help at all and die with the first 500 milligram dose.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:12.500
 Wow. OK. So I guess let's move on because it's 7.27 now.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.500
 How about the gums?

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:25.500
 We see things like guagum and locust bean gum and carob bean gum, xanthan gum and carrageenan, agar, agar

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.500
 and these other similar gums and mucilages.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.500
 How about those?

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:35.500
 I was reading the Encyclopedia Britannica yearbooks for the 1947 or so

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:44.500
 and I saw that the FDA had declared that they were so allergenic they shouldn't be considered fit for use in food.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.500
 And now they're in everything.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.500
 And now they're in everything.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.500
 Most ice cream, Scottish cheese.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:56.500
 Yeah. Run through a list of the kind of foods that you'll find these gums and mucilages in.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.500
 Oh, practically everything.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:07.500
 If they haven't figured out a way to get it into fresh eggs and oranges.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.500
 Not yet.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.500
 And even if it doesn't say on the label, that doesn't mean it's not in there. Right, Dr. Peat?

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:19.500
 Yeah. And surprisingly, even organic foods,

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:26.500
 sometimes they don't have to list things like sulfites on the labels.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:36.500
 But I think they do have to list carrageenan, but it can be in the food as a gum thickener, for example,

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.500
 and still be called organic.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:55.500
 But not long ago, there was a publication of a person who died after having an alginate dental impression made with anaphylactic shock.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:00.500
 So they're very allergenic because an alginate would be like the agar agar, right?

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:05.500
 Yeah. And in the dental school at the University of Kansas,

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:10.500
 students were practicing making alginate impressions on each other.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:21.500
 And out of 227, there were close to 50 of them who developed blisters in their mouth.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.500
 Wow. That's about 18%, isn't it?

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.500
 It took about five days to clear up.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:35.500
 And just contact can, in 20% of the people, create blisters, and in occasional unlucky people, it can kill them.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:41.500
 Wow. So these are really the things that if people that are listening to the show want to think about these things,

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:46.500
 they're basically the thickeners. So the kind of foods that we found in, I mean, ice cream, believe it or not,

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.500
 it's certainly present in ice cream.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.500
 And organic whipping cream, I noticed.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.500
 Okay, whipping cream. And how about cottage cheese?

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.500
 I've seen cottage cheese with guava gums.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.500
 Yeah, Organic Valley and the Clover Cottage Cheese, those have it in there.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.500
 I'm a fan of cottage cheese, and I was hard-pressed to find one that didn't have it.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.500
 And finally, I found Nancy's. It's quite tart, but it does have it in there.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.500
 It doesn't have the guava gums in there.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.500
 And so what I eventually did is started making my own cottage cheese, which is quite simple.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:21.500
 So what are the foods? Let's just quickly mention other foods that people can just take a look at the ingredient panel

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:29.500
 and see for themselves. So things like ice cream, cottage cheese, bread products, cookies, tortillas,

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.500
 believe it or not. Any other foods that spring to mind?

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.500
 A lot of processed foods. Just read the labels.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.500
 Yeah, it's the unfortunate thing that processed foods contain a lot of the things that we're going to talk about tonight.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:46.500
 Okay, so how about--let's quickly mention this, because I know we've spent some time at length talking about them.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:54.500
 But PUFAs, the polyunsaturated fatty acids, are a pretty big problem.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:28:06.500
 Yeah, in natural foods, I think there are two or three naturally occurring substances that account for some natural disease

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:13.500
 and possibly all of the major degenerative diseases.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:23.500
 One of those are polyunsaturated fat, starches, and sometimes an excess of iron in some natural foods,

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.500
 if you eat that exclusively.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:38.500
 For example, if you ate liver every day accompanied by orange juice, you would absorb a toxic amount of iron.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:51.500
 But just over the period of several years, you can see the accumulation of the polyunsaturated fat in the tissue.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:29:03.500
 So that old animals have highly polyunsaturated brain tissue, and all through the tissues, it's more unsaturated.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:18.500
 The long-lived animals that are remarkable for living longer than you would expect are unusually saturated in their fat.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:23.500
 Okay, all right. So we'll just basically mention the kind of things.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:30.500
 So PUFAs, you'll find these polyunsaturated in things like corn oil, soy oil, fish oils to some extent.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:36.500
 And these are things that, not so much fish oils, but the corn and the other oils,

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:44.500
 the things that are certainly used as frying oils, the things that are basically fried chips or fries, french fries,

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:49.500
 and other products that are usually fried in these kind of oils.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.500
 So certainly things to look out for.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:59.500
 In terms of what they do, Dr. Peat, just quickly mention some of the conditions that they can lead to.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:13.500
 Arthritis, cancer, dementia, wrinkly skin, susceptibility to sunburn.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:22.500
 An article that just came out two months ago was looking at the pigment epithelium in the retina.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:33.500
 And they found that the linoleic acid in particular, but all of the polyunsaturated fatty acids,

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:42.500
 created an inflammatory process that basically accelerates the degeneration of the retina.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:48.500
 One of my newsletters a couple of years ago went over that, but this was just a couple of months ago.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:55.500
 A new article showed that sturic acid or saturated fatty acids don't do that.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:08.500
 And for many years, some researchers on alcoholic liver disease have been showing that it's the polyunsaturated fats

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:15.500
 which cause cirrhosis and hepatitis when they drink alcohol.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:26.500
 In India, alcoholics who are in the butter, ghee and milk eating regions don't get cirrhosis.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:32.500
 Okay, so the cirrhosis is not apparent at all in those people then.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:38.500
 It's purely those people that would drink or consume alcohol in the presence of polyunsaturated oils in their diet.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:52.500
 Yeah, and a group led by a man named Nanshi has demonstrated that saturated fats can basically cure alcoholics cirrhosis and hepatitis.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:59.500
 Even in the presence of them continuing to drink, I think you said 32 ounces of vodka a day?

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:10.500
 That wasn't Nanshi's group, but it was about 30 or 40 years ago someone did allow them to drink a quart of vodka every day

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.500
 and they still recovered when they had their saturated fats.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:21.500
 So naturally occurring saturated fats, to recap for our listeners, are butter, coconut oil, palm oil,

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:25.500
 if it's been separated because there's two portions of the palm oil.

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:30.500
 Beef and lamb fat and cocoa butter.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:37.500
 So those are the saturated fats and the polyunsaturated fats, to name a few more, sesame seed oil,

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:45.500
 or even the nuts and seeds in high quantities will provide a lot of polyunsaturated fats if you eat primarily nuts and seeds.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:50.500
 And chickens and pigs, if they're fed on a high corn and soy diet.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.500
 Which they all are in this country.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:57.500
 Yes, their fats will be representative of what they were eating.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.500
 Even our eggs, because all chickens, even if they're fed organic feed.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:06.500
 Yes, they used to talk about the high saturated fat and cholesterol content of eggs,

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:17.500
 but about 30 years ago someone decided to reanalyze and found that at that time they were already almost purely polyunsaturated.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:26.500
 So eggs don't even have saturated fat anymore because they feed the chickens corn and soy as their main primary food.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:31.500
 Okay, well you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Garboville 91.1.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.500
 At any time now until 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:40.500
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic of the 10 most toxic things in our food.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.500
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.500
 My name's Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:48.500
 And we're joined by guest speaker Dr. Raymond Peat, endocrinologist, biochemist and physiologist.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:55.500
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911 or if you're outside the area 1800 KMUD Rad.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:04.500
 Okay, so let's go on to the next group of food products or food incorporations into food.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:09.500
 Things that make up the bulk of food in some people's diets.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:20.500
 Yeah, well, Dr. Peat, you kind of categorize saying three toxic things that are in our foods naturally occurring rather than as food additives are the polyunsaturates, the starches and excess iron.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.500
 So let's talk about starches.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:37.500
 A man named Gerhard Volkheimer, an immunologist in Berlin, had apparently read some of the older studies about 100 years ago,

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:55.500
 and he tested on his medical students having them drink a solution about a cup full of corn starch stirred into water or potato starch, various vegetable starches.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:00.500
 And then he would draw a blood sample periodically.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:10.500
 And at first it was very clear that within about 10 or 15 minutes of drinking the starch solution,

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:22.500
 you would find a lot of the unprocessed starch pellets in the bloodstream, the same size that they were when they were ingested.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:38.500
 And in some of these starches, the diameter of the starch grain is as much as 100 microns across, 10 times as wide as the cells that line the intestine.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.500
 So how did it get through?

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:50.500
 The process is called persorption, but basically it just means they are pressed on one side and they pop out the other side.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:57.500
 The cells are much more flexible than people imagine.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.500
 And you said 100 microns?

00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.500
 Yeah.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.500
 And the red blood cells are about 7.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.500
 That's the potato starch, I think.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.500
 Yeah.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:13.500
 Since the capillaries are just a few microns across and a red cell at 10 or 11 microns has to bend a little bit to get through a capillary,

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:20.500
 the starch grains can get, if they're just the right size, they could enter a capillary and get stuck.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:26.500
 But the bigger ones will plug the arterioles before they get to the capillaries.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.500
 Okay.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:49.500
 And so a full timer fed a high starch diet to mice and then sliced them up and found that every organ contained areas where cells had been killed by plugging up an artery with --

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.500
 Ischemia.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:58.500
 Ischemia. And that it accelerated the aging process by killing areas in the heart and brain and kidneys and so on.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:02.500
 So that's causing heart disease then, basically.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:03.500
 Yeah.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:22.500
 And in his medical students, after the first 15 to 30 minutes, he tested the urine and found that the same unprocessed starch grains were showing up in the urine right through the kidney organelles.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:34.500
 And somewhat later, he found it in the bile and even in the -- about an hour later, he could find it in the cerebrospinal fluid.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.500
 Wow.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:36.500
 Okay.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.500
 We do have a -- I know I want to explore this a little bit further, but we do have a caller on the line.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.500
 You're on the air?

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.500
 Hi.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.500
 How are you doing?

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.500
 Good.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.500
 And you?

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.500
 Good.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.500
 I'm doing well.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.500
 Thank you.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.500
 I just want to thank you for your show.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.500
 It's a wonderful show and just really full of great information.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.500
 And I'm calling about my -- I have a 13-year-old daughter who has allergies.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.500
 And I've heard you mention it a couple of times.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.500
 And we eat pretty well.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.500
 We live locally and eat pretty good organic food.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:09.500
 Probably about 15% is packaged, you know, just ice cream and bars maybe or potato chips, you know, and good -- anyways.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:18.500
 And so she -- my daughter has these allergies, and the symptoms are stuffy nose and then some bumps, sometimes on her face or sometimes on her legs.

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:24.500
 We had her tested for allergies, and she tested positive for Johnson grass and some molds,

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.500
 and then sensitivities to wheat, dairy, and corn.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.500
 We did an elimination diet and determined that those seemed to be the culprits,

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:38.500
 and the dairy seemed to make her more stuffed up, and the corn and wheat sort of generated the bumps.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.500
 And I was just wondering if -- you know, what your -- how would -- what your take on that is.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:50.500
 And it seemed to come on about when she was between 6 and 8 years old is when these allergies started to manifest.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.500
 Okay. And how old is she now?

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.500
 She's 13, about to be 14, so 13, yeah.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.500
 Okay. Well, Dr. Peat, do you want to comment on this?

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:06.500
 With allergies, it's similar to autoimmunity except not so serious.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:16.500
 The estrogen begins to rise, especially in girls, but in boys, too, around the age of 7 or 8.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:21.500
 It's distinctly rising in the average person.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:37.500
 And the estrogen changes the immune function, tends to shrink the thymus gland, and increase antibody production without the guidance of the thymus cells.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:47.500
 And that seems to be why it predisposes to allergies, asthma, and autoimmunity.

00:39:47.500 --> 00:40:01.500
 Asthma is now very well recognized to be increased by burst control pills, menopausal estrogen, or even the cyclic premenstrual rise in estrogen.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:12.500
 And partly that's the effect of lowering the blood sugar, because if your blood sugar falls, the immune cells become much more reactive.

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:24.500
 An experimenter gave animals -- first, he ranked the food allergens from nuts down to some fruits.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:36.500
 And the mild allergens, if he lowered the animal's blood sugar with a little insulin to 50% of normal,

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:41.500
 the mildest allergens could kill the animals with an allergic reaction.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:56.500
 But if he infused glucose while exposing them to even the worst allergens, the worst allergens might give them the sniffles or a red nose, but nothing worse.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:04.500
 So just increasing glucose or decreasing it can make just a total difference in your sensitivity.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:13.500
 And since thyroid and progesterone are the main things that allow your liver to store adequate glycogen,

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:24.500
 and estrogen is the main thing that interferes with that, that's why the sensitivities of various sorts come on around puberty.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.500
 Wow. Okay, good.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:33.500
 All right, so, you know, that's probably another misconception that sugar's bad for you.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:37.500
 Just say a little bit more about sugar in terms of its physiological effects

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:46.500
 and maybe why the culture has been turned off of sugar and onto artificial sweeteners.

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:52.500
 Oh, the cultural thing is a really complex story.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:42:05.500
 But the white sugar was already being blamed for causing diabetes 150 years ago.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:16.500
 And the treatment for diabetics was to absolutely forbid sugar, which was a completely crazy idea.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:24.500
 A French and an English doctor said that if they're losing a pound of sugar per day in their urine,

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:28.500
 they're surely going to die sooner if they don't eat any sugar.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:34.500
 So he fed them up to 12, 14 ounces of sugar.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:38.500
 He said the best white granulated sugar he could buy.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:46.500
 And he cured his patients just by feeding them as much sugar as they were losing.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:52.500
 And the process of washing it eliminates most of the allergens.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:58.500
 So the finest white sugar is really one of the safest foods available.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:05.500
 Okay, because I know there's a very big trend towards molasses sugar and the kind of brown, golden sugars.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.500
 Okay, there's another call on the line, Dr. Peat. So let's call you on the air.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.500
 Hi, I have some questions about coconut oil.

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.500
 Okay.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:26.500
 First of all, could you explain the difference between the coconut oils and the coconut milk as far as what they are and their health effects?

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:33.500
 And then the other question I have has to do with recipes for coconut oil.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:38.500
 I find it works great in stir fries if you mix it with sesame oil or something,

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:44.500
 but it doesn't really have a flavor that's conducive to, you know, eggs or things like that.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:51.500
 And I'm just wondering if you have any suggestions for recipes for coconut oil that would go well with.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.500
 Thank you.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:56.500
 The coconut water is a pretty safe material.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:06.500
 When the coconut is relatively fresh, the liquid should be almost clear and very sweet.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:17.500
 And it's been used medically, and it's surprisingly low in allergenicity.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:35.500
 But the white material that is sold as milk is an industrial manufactured substance made out of basically emulsifying some of the solids and oil with the liquid from the coconut.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:39.500
 Another source of guar gum, I think, is in coconut milk.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:47.500
 The solids in coconut are very starchy and can be pretty allergenic,

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:57.500
 so I recommend using the highly filtered deodorized form of coconut oil, which is extremely cheap.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:09.500
 Currently, it's about $50 for a five-gallon pail of it, where the aromatic delicately scented ones that haven't been filtered,

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:18.500
 some people just a teaspoon of that can make some people very sick from an allergic reaction to the starches that are left in it.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:28.500
 And if it's very well filtered, high-quality oil, it tastes fine for frying chicken.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:41.500
 I've been frying chicken in coconut oil for many years, and it works with eggs, but it isn't as tasty as butter for some foods like eggs.

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:49.500
 What's available here is the coconut oil, which is like a clear solid, like a wax almost,

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:55.500
 and that's what I've been using for stir-fries, and it doesn't seem to have quite the flavor that goes well with some recipes.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:03.500
 And then there's the coconut milk that you buy in the cans that you use in curries and Thai-style food.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.500
 So that's what's available.

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:18.500
 There have been some studies, even in the Philippines, in which the people who used milk traditionally were having health problems.

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:26.500
 So even in the traditional forms, it is probably not a very good food to use.

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:37.500
 You sent us an article, Dr. Peat, that was showing an increased risk of breast cancer in women in the Philippines who ate a lot of coconut milk in their food recipes.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:46.500
 But just to answer your question, Collar, the Chautauqua sells the tropical traditions Expeller Press coconut oil, and I think you've had some of that too, Dr. Peat.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:56.500
 That seems to be the best one I've found that doesn't have the coconut flavor, therefore it doesn't have the allogenicity that could be provided by the coconut.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:02.500
 And it's relatively tasteless, and it doesn't taste like anything, basically.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:07.500
 It's the non-organic Expeller Press tropical traditions, and they do sell it at Chautauqua.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.500
 I don't know if you live in southern Hubble or northern Hubble.

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.500
 No, I don't.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.500
 What I see available is this waxy stuff.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:26.500
 It looks like the pure oil, but I find confusion about the health effects of the oil, which I've heard you recommend quite a bit.

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:31.500
 And it seems to make me flush and raise my body temperature sometimes.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:42.500
 And the coconut milk, which sometimes I think has the same effect, but I don't cook with it that often because those recipes are so tasty that I overeat.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:51.500
 So anyway, I'm trying to figure out how to work it into my diet if it really has these positive effects in a way that makes it appetizing.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:52.500
 Thank you.

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:53.500
 Thank you for your call.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:48:00.500
 One of the very pleasant ways to use the deodorized oil is to emulsify it.

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.500
 A little bit of egg yolk is all it takes.

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:18.500
 If you warm the oil and the milk, just a touch of egg yolk will allow it to emulsify about 50 percent oil to milk or whatever concentration you want.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:38.500
 And you can make ice cream or cheesecake, all kinds of buttery, creamy, consistency foods using instead of cream or cream cheese, you can use the coconut oil emulsified.

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:39.500
 OK, great. Thank you.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:40.500
 Let's move on.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:47.500
 I think I wanted to cover the starches a little bit more, but let's move on to the next ingredients.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:52.500
 The GMO microbial enzymes and the vegetarian rennet.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.500
 These are kind of cheese replacements.

00:48:54.500 --> 00:49:02.500
 Will you talk a little bit about rennet and why natural rennet from a cow's or young calf's stomach is not being used now,

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:13.500
 but it's being genetically modified on yeasts and other microorganisms and how this has contributed to allergies in people and people that say they can't eat cheese, etc.?

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:21.500
 I think it's the trace allergens, parts of the fungus or the bacteria.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.500
 Aspergillosis is a very serious disease,

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:38.500
 and people who work in some of these enzyme factories are exposed to dust from the microorganisms and develop allergies of various sorts.

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:50.500
 But the regulators assume that the people who eat the stuff aren't going to have the same sort of reactions.

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:56.500
 Aspergillosis is farmers' lung, isn't it?

00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:04.500
 They get it from moldy straw, and it's another respiratory pre-occupational disease for farmers.

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:13.500
 Yeah, and all of the organisms used in manufacturing amino acids or proteins or enzymes,

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:20.500
 all of them have their risk of the impurities being left in the product.

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:44.500
 The food producers are being pressured in various ways to give up the natural material and buy their stuff in a can and do it like they were in a chemical lab rather than a kitchen.

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:55.500
 Many kinds of pressure are affecting the food supply so that people are coming to believe that the industrial way is necessary.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:51:07.500
 You can see government and commercial websites that say these things are necessary for high-quality food.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:14.500
 If you're going to keep the food on the shelf for a month or two, maybe it's necessary.

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:24.500
 For example, Nancy's cottage cheese used to be natural cottage cheese,

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:37.500
 and the way cottage cheese was always made was to drain the curd and salt it, and draining it left the curd free of lactic acid.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:52:02.500
 A couple of years ago, someone convinced the Nancy's yogurt people to start using what they call a dressing consisting of lactic acid and something else to give the cottage cheese a very long shelf life.

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:17.500
 Lactic acid suppresses the growth of organisms, but it's also just as toxic to the people who eat it as it is to the organisms that are being suppressed by it.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:28.500
 It very quickly can stimulate the whole inflammatory chain reaction, the same as the polyunsaturated fat.

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:35.500
 If that inflammation is continued chronically, then it increases fibrosis.

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:45.500
 The same as radiation, any of these chronic inflammations eventually increase the risk of cancer.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:51.500
 We're told it's good for us. Lactic acid is great for your intestinal health, right? That's what we're told.

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.500
 We have a caller on the line.

00:52:53.500 --> 00:53:00.500
 We'd better be very quick though, because it is four minutes to, and I do want to give people some more information about Dr. Ray Peat.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.500
 So, it's going to be for about two minutes, unfortunately, but you're on the air.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:11.500
 All right, I'll take ten seconds. I just wanted to ask, what do you think of olive oil and canola oil? And I'll go off the air.

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.500
 Okay, thank you. Dr. Peat?

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:26.500
 In small quantities, like a teaspoonful or so of olive oil, it's fine, safe, because it's only 10 percent of the toxic polyunsaturated fats.

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:40.500
 Canola oil is very high in the polyunsaturated, and it got its reputation as being a healthful oil about 30 years ago,

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:45.500
 when they learned to lower the erucic acid content.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:58.500
 But Hans Selye demonstrated that it is not the erucic acid which was causing it to cause heart damage and other degenerative processes.

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:07.500
 It was the linoleic acid itself, the so-called essential fatty acid, which was causing death of heart cells.

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:17.500
 And he showed that just by adding stearic acid from cocoa butter, he could neutralize the toxic effect on the heart.

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:26.500
 So, it's the ratio, and the canola oil has a very high content of the dangerous polyunsaturated.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:34.500
 Thank you for that, Dr. Peat. I just want to summarize the rennet with referring to the cheeses.

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:39.500
 The natural sources of rennet that have been used for thousands of years are animal rennet,

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:48.500
 or non-animal natural sources are fig juice, nettles, thistles, mallow, creeping charlene, cardoon thistle, vinegar, lemon juice, or just letting the milk sour to form a curd.

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:58.500
 Artificial sources of rennet are enzymes, vegetarian rennet, microbial enzymes, and they are either derived from molds, so they're very allergenic, or they're genetically engineered.

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:03.500
 So, vegetarian rennet, folks, is not a safe rennet.

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:10.500
 Okay, well, we apologize for not mentioning Dr. Ray Peat's contact details at the end of last month's "Ask Your Heart Doctor."

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:20.500
 We had the program on the dangers of medical radiation. It was very interesting, and unfortunately, Dr. Peat wasn't mentioned there as the contact details.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:30.500
 So, he can be reached on his website. He has a website, and it's www.raypeat.com. That's R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:38.500
 And we can be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBM-ERB for consultations or further information.

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:42.500
 And once again, thank you, Dr. Peat, for joining us.

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:43.500
 Okay, thank you.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:44.500
 It's always a pleasure.

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:48.500
 Well, we've probably only got halfway through the food ingredients.

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:52.500
 Unfortunately, it's an unfortunate thing about most people.

00:55:52.500 --> 00:56:01.500
 Yeah, don't often think that much about what they are putting into their bodies, and people should just take more time to look at the ingredient panels on the foods that they eat,

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.500
 because you will find a lot of hidden material that does cause problems.
