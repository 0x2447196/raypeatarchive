00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 From the Hill Country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Well, very pleasant. Good morning to you. Welcome back. Patrick Timpone and this is

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.240
 OneRadioNetwork.com. Nice to be here with you. It is the 20th of June and on the third

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.000
 Wednesday of each month, we have the honor and pleasure of talking with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.920
 He's a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon, specialized in physiology. He taught

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.760
 schools at University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, National College

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:55.680
 of Naturopathic Medicine, Universidad in Veracruzanza in Mexico. He spent some time down there and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.520
 that's how he taught us, learned how to de-nextimalization of corn. He taught us about that. So he did

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:10.920
 a lot of work with progesterone and he's with us, as I said, for the last third Wednesday,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.280
 third Monday, I'll get it, of each month. He's on the 800 line, that's the one we use.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.000
 So if you'd like to ask him a question, the way to do it is Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.760
 Tells me before the show that they have a lot of water up there in the Northwest. Good

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.560
 morning, Dr. Peat. Good morning. Yeah, almost every day now for

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.000
 weeks and weeks. Is that right? Wow. Have you seen some of the droughty stuff going

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.640
 on in Arizona and Texas? Boy, we are really going through it. Yeah, I guess our drought's

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.720
 over here at least. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the last time we talked a few times ago, you were

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.120
 looking at moving more into more carbs, carbohydrates, you were talking about that. And I came across

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.320
 some video, Dr. Peat, that somebody sent me about these things called oxalates, you know,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.240
 in the vegetables? So I'm listening to this lady, the PhD type, sound really... So she

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.840
 got me all wound up about researching oxalates. And since I don't sleep, I thought, well,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.560
 maybe oxalates are causing... So I just cut out all my oxalates and there's nothing left

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.040
 but meat. So I'm doing the opposite of you. So I, you know, I shouldn't do that. You have

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.880
 a PhD in nutrition. I'm doing the opposite of what you're doing. So I don't know if I'm

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:51.640
 on the right track here. I tend to avoid the leaves that are high oxalic just because the

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.040
 effect on your teeth is so harsh. On your teeth? Oh, I didn't know the teeth. Oxalates

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.960
 are these little small, they kind of razor blade kind of things that the plants create.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:13.640
 And where else do they go in the body? They strongly bind calcium and magnesium. They

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:23.640
 bind calcium and magnesium. Yeah. And so it forms stones in the kidneys. But as it passes

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:32.480
 through your mouth, it makes your teeth rough. So it's taking calcium right out of your enamel.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.840
 No kidding. I mean, and even the Mayo Clinic, I saw that people with kidney stones, they

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.360
 recommend you don't eat spinach. Yeah. I mean... Rhubarb is similar. Rhubarb. So what are the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.480
 other... So the ones I were doing that were high Dr. Peat were almonds and spinach and chard.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:01.800
 I was really doing a lot of high oxalate foods. Yeah, they do taste good if they're cooked

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:14.440
 until the magnesium and calcium somewhat react to protect your teeth. Now when you cook spinach,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:24.480
 you still have the oxalates, correct? Oh, yeah. If you do it with baking soda, that

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:38.400
 to a certain extent antagonizes the destructive effect of oxalate. Baking soda? Really? Would

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.000
 we ever want to take baking soda like ongoing or anything? Oh, yeah. Lots of people like

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:56.880
 to cook their spinach and chard. It makes it softer very quickly and has a much different

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:06.200
 taste. Bright green color. My goodness. Very fresh taste. And it actually disperses the

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:14.200
 oxalates from the spinach? It gets in their way. It gets in their way. They don't react

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:23.240
 so much. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's curious. So what if you would take baking

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.520
 soda just in water? Some people like to do that one or two times a day just because...

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:36.120
 Any benefit, do you think? Oh, yeah. Athletes have demonstrated that taking a tablespoon

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:46.560
 and a half a glass or so of water before an endurance race, it improves things for several

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:57.640
 hours. Wow. That's a lot. A tablespoon. Yeah. A lot of people do one teaspoon at a time.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:10.520
 So how does it affect performance for athletes? It suppresses the formation of lactic acid

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:21.120
 and so it postpones fatigue and actually lets you make more energy with less stress. And

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:32.080
 what effects would it have then on the stomach and acid and all that? Baking soda. Oh, it

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:43.960
 is quickly absorbed and almost as quickly the sodium starts acting as a diuretic and

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:58.920
 so leaves the body, taking the alkaline part out of the body. There are enzymes in place

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:12.480
 that when the pH rises because the sodium has left, the CO2 is converted from the bicarbonate

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:24.280
 that you ate into the gas, which is soluble inside cells. And so very quickly after taking

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:35.440
 some baking soda, the pH inside cells such as in your brain becomes more acidic. Acidic

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:45.280
 or alkaline? No, more acidic, surprisingly. Everyone was assuming that it would be alkaline.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:55.040
 Yeah, but the alkali goes away in the urine very quickly and because of the enzymes all

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:06.160
 through your body, when the pH drops because the sodium is gone, then instantly the bicarbonate

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:15.840
 is turned into intracellular gas. The gas is soluble inside cells and so lowers the

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:26.880
 pH inside cells. Inside the cells. And is that a good thing, Dr. Peat? Yeah. The slightly

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:45.600
 acidic cell 6.8 pH is metabolically efficient. The inefficiency known as the Warburg effect

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:58.560
 involves a rising pH in which lactic acid is formed and acidifies the whole region.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:08.920
 And so if you lower the pH, you suppress the formation of lactic acid, making your metabolism

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.440
 much more efficient. That's why it increases endurance. Could that help thyroid if your

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:22.680
 metabolism is up? Oh yeah, it interferes with what the thyroid is doing. Interesting. Yeah,

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.600
 we had a Dr. Robert O. Young on, he's a pH guy, and he recommended taking baking soda

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:35.680
 a couple of times a day just in general. He didn't say that the cells actually get more

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:42.520
 acid though. He's always talking about how things are better alkaline, but it's interesting.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:48.120
 I wonder how that would affect someone that would have cancer cells running around. Would

00:09:48.120 --> 00:10:01.000
 that be good? Oh yeah, everyone pretty much has some cells that are very much like cancer

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:12.800
 cells in that they are stuck in the condition of inefficiency in which they're producing

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:19.520
 lactic acid rather than good energy. Oh, so that's what the cancer cells are doing. They're

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:28.880
 creating lactic acid. Yeah, and in the process, they leave the cell where the acid has been

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:43.200
 created, taking away acidity from the interior of the cell. When you form lactic acid in

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:55.280
 a stressed cell, that means the interior of the cell is more alkaline than it should be,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:06.880
 and that blocks endurance metabolism, blocks oxidative metabolism, and it's efficient.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:20.640
 And so that inefficiency keeps the cell producing lactic acid in a vicious circle. And just

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:30.240
 increasing your CO2 or your bicarbonate, you can break that vicious circle. Isn't that

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:38.160
 interesting? Well, I've been looking at, you can get a CO2 tank that's made of aluminum

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.680
 so it's not too heavy so you can carry it, and then one of those little suits that you

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.600
 can put up. So I'm going to do it. I'll let you know how we do with that. It's kind of

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:58.080
 fun. Oh yeah. And when you have been under stress, you can see your skin looking pale

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:09.920
 and anemic. And within 15 or 20 minutes of being immersed in CO2, you can feel your skin.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:17.400
 Well, actually if you step into a big bag of it, you can feel it on your sensitive parts

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:25.720
 immediately. In about 20 minutes, you can see your skin getting pink. Yeah. Yeah, they

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:31.520
 have these little bags where I think they're used for ozone, and they're very inexpensive

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.360
 and you can just put them up to your neck, you know, and just fill that puppy up, you

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:40.000
 know. Oh, where do you get those? I don't know, but I'll send you the link. Yeah, I

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.400
 found it somewhere. It looked pretty nice, looked pretty inexpensive, and it looked like

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:51.560
 it was... I think they use it for ozone, Dr. Peat, is what they do. You know, for ozone.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:58.840
 Yeah, once years ago I got some big ones from a florist, but haven't had that source for

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.360
 years. Yeah, yeah. Dr. Roy Peat is with us if you'd like to ask him a question. Patrick

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.240
 at OneRadioNetwork.com, but I'll send you that link when I go to buy it here. I think

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:15.320
 I'm going to do it this week. So, how have you been doing? You liking taking more carbs

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.240
 and proteins? What was the purpose of that? What do you want to experiment with? Oh yeah,

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:34.800
 it continues to support energy and seems to increase my sensitivity to thyroid. The impression

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:47.880
 I've had is that everyone is running a little high on protein in the diet after they have

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:59.640
 achieved adult size, that they don't need nearly so much protein, and increasing the

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:11.120
 carbohydrate to a ratio of six or seven carbs to one protein gram can be very energizing.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:25.560
 Oh, what is it again? Seven to one ratio is often very, very good. Seven to one ratio.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:31.440
 So I guess back on the vegetables, if we're eating vegetables like squash and tomatoes

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:38.960
 and things like that, they don't have these oxalates, right? None that I know of. So it's

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:50.760
 mainly the chard and the spinach and what are some other ones? Rhubarb. But according

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.440
 to some of the things I'm seeing, even baked potatoes, I mean, baked potatoes should be

00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:02.080
 a good food, shouldn't they? It should be what? It should be a good food, right? Oh,

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:14.440
 it is, yeah. Well-cooked potatoes are almost a complete diet in itself. So even if people

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:22.880
 say that they have high oxalates, who cares? Just a good food, right? Just eat them. Yeah,

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:36.320
 the phosphate is probably as bad as the oxalate. The phosphate interferes with your calcium

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:43.320
 and magnesium, too. Oh, the phosphate in meats? Or in some vegetables. In some vegetables,

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:50.280
 too. Wow. Potatoes are a little high in phosphate. And then how about if we go over to these

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:58.280
 pesky grains like rice and buckwheat and amaranth and things like that? Do these things have

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:11.680
 any issues that we need to concern ourselves with or just enjoy them? Yeah, as a main staple

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:23.120
 of your diet, they have far too much phosphate. So you have to take care to balance it with

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:31.600
 magnesium and calcium. And is it better then if we can soak them and then sprout them as

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:48.840
 well? Yeah, the very tasty, more primitive grains are the highest in phosphates and irritants.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:17:03.400
 The Chinese, with their polished white rice, had reasons. The stuff that's removed, the

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:16.720
 bran and germ, cause the rice to become rancid and harmful. And so about 30 or 40,000 years

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:27.200
 ago they developed a method of polishing it so that it would last a whole season. Oh,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:35.520
 that's why they did it. Wow. That's why they polished it up so it would last. Yeah, and

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:44.320
 they had other foods and so there was no concern about a B vitamin deficiency if they were

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:51.200
 generally well fed. I just got an email in from Gloria. While you're talking about oxalates,

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:57.840
 please ask Dr. Peat about oxalates in green tea or black tea. Are these harmful? Do green

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:06.800
 teas have oxalates? Yeah, but the quantity is usually not enough. Not enough to worry

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:12.600
 about? Yeah, two or three cups of tea. Black pepper is supposedly really high. Is that

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:19.480
 not a good thing, black pepper? It's a very popular spice. Oh, yeah, and the volume of

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:31.080
 it. You could specialize in putting thick amounts of pepper on your food, but normally

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.640
 it's a small amount. Yeah, just a little bit. And then beans? Beans are high in oxalates

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:50.600
 too, right? Beans? Yeah, seeds in general. The phosphates are right up there with the

00:18:50.600 --> 00:19:02.000
 oxalates for interfering with your calcium. But orange juice is good. I got my orange

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:10.640
 juice going this morning, Doc. Boy, you still drink a lot of orange juice? Yeah, if you

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:22.160
 can find edible oranges, the quality of the whole food supply seems to have decreased

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:38.720
 tremendously. Vividly moldy tasting oranges are being included in very expensive organic

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:45.960
 juice. So you don't want to force yourself to drink orange juice that should have been

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:52.280
 discarded. Yeah, it's not easy. I drove all the way to Austin this weekend just to get

00:19:52.280 --> 00:20:02.560
 some organic oranges. You can't find them. They're harder and harder to find. Well, I

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:10.640
 tell you what, let's do this, Dr. Ray Peat. Let's take a little break and we'll do a couple

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:17.640
 commercials and then we'll come back and then we'll take some emails, okay? Okay. Okay.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:29.240
 Come here, Judo. Come here, girl. Let me take your... Come here. I'm going to take her collar

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.560
 off. She does a little scratching and she goes jingle jangle. Here, let me take this

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:45.160
 off. There you go. Now you can scratch a little bit. We've been doing pretty good. I mean,

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:51.200
 we got a little scratching going on, but nothing compared to normally. There's a product that

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:56.520
 we've been using. We don't have a financial interest in it, but it's called Wonderside.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:11.320
 It's W-O-N-D-E-R-C-I-D-E. It's mainly cedar, I think. Cedar? Yeah, cedar trees. They have

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:20.360
 a spray and then you also can have a spot on thing. Get this thing straight. You can

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.480
 put it on your doggies.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:33.560
 I'm just having trouble with my earphone here. You can put it on your doggies back,

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:40.760
 you know, on the spine there and it's totally clean, totally safe and it helps. So she's

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:46.320
 been doing really good. Generally, the fleas can get pretty feisty here out in the country,

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:54.880
 so we're scratching a little bit, but not too much. Shin Blossom is one of our sponsors.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.840
 Not Wonderside, but you can get Wonderside. If you'd like to go to their website, it really

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:12.280
 is a special place. They have a blood purifier thing, which is very interesting. Arise the

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:22.760
 male formula, bamboo chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is kind of fun. That alkalizes things a little

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:36.880
 bit. Seaweeds, extra virgin olive oil. He has shaga, reishi, goji berries, schizandra.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:47.960
 The protein formulas, the heishiwu, very, very, very high quality. And that's mainly

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:53.680
 for the kidneys. If you want to get Mr. Kidney working good, heishiwu. These are all on Shin

00:22:53.680 --> 00:23:01.080
 Blossom on OneRadioNetwork.com. We think you'll enjoy being there. They just have superb selection

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:06.480
 and high quality ever. You've heard maybe some of the shows where he tells you how he

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:17.560

 There's Shin Blossom on OneRadioNetwork.com. And then he's the same fellow that puts together

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:51.000
 the blue shield, and that's the EMF protection

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.400
 device that is very, very high quality. And it works on the cells in the body. So it helps

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:07.200
 the little cells to just react in a more powerful, strong way to electromagnetic fields. It doesn't

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:13.080
 block them or anything. It just works on the cells in the body. They have lots of research

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:20.680
 and papers written on working with chickens and cows, and they have better production

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:29.680
 and lower mortality when they are protected with the blue shield. A 10% off promo code

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.160
 People are getting manic and taking all these stuff because they don't have sulfur in their

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.200
 brain or something? That's correct. That's correct. And there's

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.760
 reasons for that. Kid out there in the street buying illegal drugs, it's all caused from

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.120
 that. Every bit of it. The manic depression, suicidal tendencies, it's all caused from

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:55.120
 a lack of sulfur to the brain. Because glyphosate stops the uptake of sulfur from the body to

00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:00.040
 the brain. There's a lymph system that runs from the digestive tract to the brain directly,

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.280
 and all they were finding is sulfur. It goes straight to the brain, because we're a sulfur

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:09.080
 being, we have to have the sulfur to keep us sane. If you don't have sulfur going to

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.360
 your brain, you become manic. If you look at all the drugs that they give people, they

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.880
 put artificial sulfur in there. It's a molecule, artificial to trick the brain to think that

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.200
 you've got sulfur in your bloodstream. We have a way to get sulfur into your bloodstream,

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.200
 and you don't have to trick your brain. Just put it in there. With our pure organic sulfur,

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:53.640
 We're talking with Dr. Ray Peat. He's here on the third Wednesday, I get it, the first

00:25:53.640 --> 00:26:01.200
 Wednesday of every month, and he takes your questions, and his website is RayPeat.com.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:10.280
 His newsletter is Ray Peat's Newsletter, that's plural, RayPeat's Newsletter at gmail.com.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:20.040
 That's the email address, and then you can just kind of sign up for that.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:25.880
 I had one here I was going to start with, and I lost it. Oh, here it is. Here's a 45-year-old

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:31.000
 male who wants to know if Dr. Peat thinks it's a good idea that I take a little bit

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 of that progesterone that he recommends from time to time.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 Especially if you have symptoms of any kind of stress, especially sex-related stress,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 failure of libido to be active when you need it, and sometimes just general overall well-being.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 It starts around the age of 45 when that's likely to be noticeable, and very, very common

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:22.920
 around the age of 50.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:28.760
 And here's another one right in line. Should progesterone be taken intermittently during

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:35.760
 pregnancy, i.e. for a couple of weeks or less each month?

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:49.560
 The function of pausing it for two weeks per month is that the estrogen tends to be at

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:05.680
 risk of continual activity, and progesterone clears the estrogen out of your cells, inactivates

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:17.920
 it, and causes it to be excreted. And if you keep taking the same amount every day, your

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:30.680
 liver recognizes that it has risen every day, and so it starts regulating it down. That

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:42.880
 means that it can lose effect if you continue to use it after two weeks. So if you just

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:50.760
 stop taking it, your liver forgets about it for a while and will recognize it as a problem

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:58.760
 and will recognize it as an anti-estrogen protective substance when it comes in again.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:06.960
 So this is only for pregnant women, not necessarily the rest of us, right?

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:13.960
 This is for cycling women. It's an essential part of maintaining good cycling. And in pregnancy,

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:26.680
 it's usually a failure to sustain progesterone production in relation to estrogen that causes

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:38.400
 miscarriage problems or bleeding during pregnancy, and oxemia and so on.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:47.080
 What about women who have stopped menstruating kind of prematurely for whatever reason? Could

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:54.080
 they use the progesterone to kind of get back cycling again?

00:29:54.080 --> 00:30:02.320
 In fertility clinics, they have found that women who are most likely to succeed in implanting

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:12.240
 and becoming pregnant, when the process started, they had a ratio of progesterone to estrogen

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:23.560
 between 50 and 100 to 1, much higher progesterone than estrogen. Around 10, they sometimes can

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:39.200
 become pregnant, but they're right on the borderline then.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:45.560
 So progesterone to estrogen for the infertile ladies are very high to E, correct? Progesterone

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.560
 to estrogen?

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:53.560
 Yeah, the ratio at the beginning when you're trying to get pregnant should be between 50

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.920
 and 100.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:03.600
 Oh, should be when you're trying to get pregnant. Okay. So that's when you would build up on

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.600
 the progesterone at the beginning there.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:15.600
 Yeah, if you take a gigantic excess of progesterone, you can block conception. That requires more

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:23.760
 like a thousand to one.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:30.760
 Yeah. Here's an email from Miles in Copenhagen, Denmark. Copenhagen. Any thoughts on a suitable

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:39.240
 baby formula in case of insufficient or lacking breast milk? And then there's also going through

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:47.240
 this whole shortage thing. So if you were going to make a baby formula, what would you

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:47.760
 use?

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:54.760
 Cow milk is the next best thing to human milk, and sometimes it's better because cow's milk

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:05.720
 is built on nutrients that have passed through the fermenting rumen and cleaned up, detoxified

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:19.720
 of lots of things such as unnecessary polyunsaturated fatty acids. The woman has no rumen, and so

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:32.920
 everything in her diet tends to go into the formation of milk. And that means that if

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:41.760
 the mother is not eating well, her milk can be worse than cow's milk.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:48.760
 Oh, because that's the whole... We don't do that. We go right to the blood, right?

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:56.760
 Yeah. The cow's milk can be distorted by a bad food supply, but it's very, very resistant

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:08.000
 because of the stabilizing effect of bacterial detoxification.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:18.520
 So moms supplementing, whether if there's an issue with breastfeeding or if they're

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:25.760
 on baby formula and they can't get it, just cow's milk, organic cow's milk.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:32.960
 Yeah. When you dehydrate anything like milk, which is a very fragile material, all kinds

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:46.800
 of things go wrong in the process of dehydrating. The fragile amino acids, the amino acids,

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:54.800
 the tryptophan, for example, easily oxidizes into toxins, and vitamin B2 is one of the

00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:09.760
 earliest things to become toxic among the fats and vitamins. And then the polyunsaturated

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:22.280
 fats deteriorate very, very fast in the toxins.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:27.160
 Would you add anything to the cow's milk, Dr. Peat, or just straight cow's milk? Would

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:31.160
 you put anything else in there?

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:38.160
 It's a little different. You can find suggested recipe changes, slight additions.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:46.160
 I can remember years ago in the 50s, lots of ladies who couldn't or after breastfeeding,

00:34:46.160 --> 00:35:07.520
 they would actually use, I think it was carnation, carnation milk and carol syrup. Remember carol

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.920
 syrup?

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.920
 Not that one. I don't remember.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:18.920
 Yeah, they had a formula. Ladies used to use that. I remember them doing that. I don't

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:30.920
 know how I remember that.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:38.920
 Here is Tino. She says, "My eight-year-old daughter is very tall for her age. She's five

00:35:53.920 --> 00:36:00.920
 feet and is already showing signs of early puberty, very emotional, and first signs of

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:13.360
 growing breasts at eight years old. Her blood work are normal except that her TSH has always

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:22.720
 been between two and three and at one point was as high as five. Is there any ideas of

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:29.720
 some things we could look at to delay puberty, prolong a healthy and happy childhood as long

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.880
 as possible?"

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:37.880
 Yeah. As thyroid becomes deficient, when it goes from three to five, that's very, very

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:46.200
 important. The deficient thyroid causes the estrogen to rise and the estrogen guides the

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:58.960
 growth pattern, increases the width of the hips and matures bones more quickly.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:12.320
 So the low thyroid increases estrogen and this could be really affecting her and she

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:18.000
 could actually be showing signs of growing breasts at eight years old.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 Yeah. That is fairly common to happen around the age of eight.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 Really? What could be some foods that she could eat to help balance that or foods to

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.320
 stay away from?

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:38.320
 Make sure she's getting enough vitamin D and milk in her diet.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:43.680
 Milk and vitamin D?

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:50.680
 Not overdoing any particular food. Getting a good range of fruits, vegetables. Once in

00:37:50.680 --> 00:38:05.680
 a while, seafood, regular egg, almond.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:19.840
 The soy, could soy be a problem if they're doing soy?

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:28.680
 Soy contains a very strong estrogen. If a male is given soy protein at an early age,

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:43.600
 his genitalia are feminized and if it continues beyond the very, very beginning of the formation,

00:38:43.600 --> 00:39:00.040
 it increases the risk of pituitary tumors and reproduction-related tumors.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:09.920
 We saw some studies years ago, Dr. Ray P. Doan, I think it was in the Philippines, after

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:16.320
 in the 80s or 90s when this whole soy milk thing got huge and they started filling their

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:23.320
 kids up with soy in the Philippines and had some real early puberty there. It was crazy.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:27.280
 No surprise, right?

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:34.280
 Yeah, it affects both sexes. The worst effects are visible on male babies.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:50.280
 Let's see, here's an email. "I was diagnosed after a CT scan to have metastatic and carcinogenic

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:02.960
 cancer tumors. All signs point to this, yet they don't know until I get a biopsy, which

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:10.880
 I will not do. I started eating the kind of sugar you recommended. A very short time later,

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:16.360
 I got a painful and bloated urinary tract infection. As a kid, I was prone to them and

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:22.040
 now avoid eating things that have caused them in the past, one being too much sugar. Please

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:26.040
 tell me what you think could possibly be going on and what I should do."

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:33.040
 So we have a CT scan of metastatic and carcinogenic cancer tumors. What could be something this

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:38.360
 person could do?

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.360
 Where are the tumors?

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.360
 It doesn't say.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.360
 It doesn't say.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:51.360
 The type of tumors is important.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:59.360
 To definitely shift your metabolism towards thyroid away from estrogen.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:04.120
 Towards increasing thyroid function.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:11.120
 Yeah, which will prevent the carcinogenic tendency of the estrogen. And the sugar metabolism

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:28.160
 is regulated largely by the thyroid. So what you're eating isn't as important as, in this

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:38.440
 case, how your thyroid is working.

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:45.440
 So you want to get a thyroid test to make sure you have a TSH below .5, right?

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.320
 Yeah, that's the safe population.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.680
 That's the ideal, is a really, really low TSH.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:58.680
 Yeah, when they find a population that is in that zone, they are free of cancer of the

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:04.040
 thyroid gland.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.160
 And how about this person? Oh, I think they're just emailing in with the location because

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:15.160
 they're listening. Liver and lower right abdomen, the location of these two little tumors.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:21.560
 Yeah, did they say what they're attached to?

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:28.560
 Do you know any more? Email her, can you send in, she's listening, what they're attached

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.560
 to, what these tumors are attached to.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:38.560
 Yeah, the intestine or exactly what are they.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:45.560
 If you have more information, email it in and Dr. Peat can maybe give you some more ideas

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.200
 on what to do.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:56.200
 So what would be some no foods for this person with these tumors?

00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:08.560
 In general, it's important to not have a very extreme diet of a particular food, especially

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:16.560
 soy and other estrogenic foods. Not to have an excess of protein or fat, keeping both

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:33.720
 protein and fat down to maybe 10% of the calories.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:40.720
 And just not get too extreme in any direction.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.720
 Yeah, especially fat.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:48.720
 Especially fat, so the cancer does, fat's not good for cancer, for tumors?

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:55.720
 No, the cancer thrives on fat. When a person stops eating sugar, for example, their body

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:06.800
 starts breaking down protein and fat because the cancers send out hormones to take down

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:17.920
 your muscles and other tissues to release fatty acids and amino acids into the blood.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:31.720
 Cancer has a reputation for eating glucose, but really as soon as you shut off the glucose

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:41.240
 supply, then the damage really starts because you start destroying your own tissues, turning

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:46.480
 it into food.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:53.480
 The waste and disease of cancer begins when you stop providing glucose to your body.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.480
 When you stop providing it.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:04.480
 She wrote back, "These tumors are attached to the small intestine or ascending colon."

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:11.480
 That's all the information she has.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.480
 The information who has?

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:19.480
 The lady with the tumors, small intestine or ascending colon, she believes they're attached

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.480
 to.

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:27.480
 Oh, well, it's important to, they might be able to surgically remove that little section

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:33.600
 of the intestine.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:38.600
 Oh, you mean if they can do it right and not hurt anything?

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:39.600
 Mm-hmm.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:44.600
 Can the sugar cause UTI infections, she writes back?

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:51.600
 No, not really, because it increases your anti-inflammatory defensive system.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:46:00.600
 Well, we wish you well.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.600
 Let us know if we can help with something.

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:09.600
 Patrick Timpani, along with Dr. Ray Peat, RayPeat.com, his newsletter is RayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:19.600
 Could you please ask Dr. Peat, writes Rachel, for tips on reducing inflammation in the body

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:28.600
 as it is supposed to be the root cause of most diseases?

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.600
 Thank you for your shows.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:35.600
 So, just in general, inflammation?

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:42.600
 Almost all the serious degenerative diseases are based on the chronic inflammation, a tendency

00:46:42.600 --> 00:47:02.600
 to abnormal coagulation.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:09.600
 And so, that puts aspirin in a very important position.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:17.600
 Carbon dioxide is another of our anti-inflammatory agents.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:24.600
 So, baking soda helps with anti-inflammation.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.600
 Well, I just kind of have an idea.

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:33.600
 Do you think that carbon dioxide could help the lady with the tumors?

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.600
 Oh, undoubtedly.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.600
 Undoubtedly? Really?

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:44.600
 Yeah, there is an article fairly recently, a year or two, the title is "Is Baking Soda a Magic Bullet in Cancer?"

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:55.600
 And that is what baking soda is to carbon dioxide, right?

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.600
 Yeah, the same effects from both of them.

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.600
 Oh, that's cool.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:05.600
 And you can get aluminum-free baking soda really easily these days.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.600
 Hi, Dr. Peat.

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:20.600
 If someone suspects they may have too much acetylcholine production, what could they do to reduce this,

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:26.600
 other than taking anti-chlorogenic substances?

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.600
 Is there something clearly that can be done?

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:39.600
 Yeah, when your body is failing to cope in some way with problems,

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:55.600
 you go into the cholinergic, sort of helpless condition in which inflammation can go unregulated.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:10.600
 And so I think it's helpful to use the anti-cholinergic whenever you feel benefit from it.

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:18.600
 Anti-histamines are generally the same as anti-cholinergic.

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:25.600
 Also, if someone has severe milk protein allergies,

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.600
 do you think that they can get enough calcium from well-cooked greens,

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:37.600
 or should they also add eggshells or pearl powder calcium supplements, in your view?

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:54.600
 I think powdered eggshells are a first aid in case you're doubtful whether you're going to have a problem with the leaves.

00:49:54.600 --> 00:50:00.600
 It's good to have some powdered eggshell on hand.

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:05.600
 So you like those for calcium, powdered eggshells?

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:15.600
 Yeah, and they should be prepared by dehydrating them and thoroughly separating the membrane

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:19.600
 before you grind them up in a coffee grinder.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:27.600
 Oh, interesting. That's how people do it. They actually grind them up themselves.

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:41.600
 Hi Dr. Peat, if a young woman was trying to improve her acne by taking Progest-E orally during the luteal phase with no skin improvement,

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:48.600
 would you recommend them to apply some Progest-E directly onto the pimples for a more direct approach?

00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:50.600
 Directly to where?

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:54.600
 Luteal, L-U-T-E-A-L, on her acne.

00:50:54.600 --> 00:51:04.600
 She said that she was trying to improve her acne by taking Progest-E orally during the luteal phase.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.600
 I'm not sure what that is. Luteal? Do you know? L-U-T-E-A-L?

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:10.600
 Yeah, that's when the ovaries are producing.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.600
 I see, when the ovaries are producing their things.

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.600
 Yeah, so it gives a boost.

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:26.600
 When your progesterone isn't adequate during that phase, it's usually because your thyroid is low.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:36.600
 So, supplementing thyroid is often better than using progesterone.

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:43.600
 Oh, I see. Right going to what could be the root cause of the issue, which would be an underactive thyroid.

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.600
 Yeah.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:56.600
 Again, folks, I mentioned this before, we don't have a financial interest, but there's a place called Let's Get Checked that we used one time.

00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:04.600
 I think it was $60 and they send it to your house, you do the blood thing, and they'll give you your TSH.

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:08.600
 Pretty quick. Send it in, boom.

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:13.600
 Let's Get Checked is the name of the company.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:20.600
 Yeah, that sounds good too. Bypass the need of a doctor.

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:25.600
 Yeah, yeah, and that's all you're interested in, the TSH anyway, right?

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:32.600
 That's all you're... yeah. Cool.

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.600
 Okay.

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:43.600
 Got a few more minutes if you'd like to jump in with a question for Dr. Ray P. Patrick at OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:49.600
 Let me go to the ones we missed last month, because we always miss them.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:53:05.600
 I can find the right... I have so many. Oh, here it is. Okay.

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:26.600
 So we have a lady here, Dr. Peat, who is 47, a recovering alcoholic, prophylactic smoke, P-R-O-P-H-A-O-L-I-C, not sure if it's smoker, oh, with a colostomy bag. God love you.

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:31.600
 Now since she's been 24, heart and liver issues.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:39.600
 Can you give her some ideas on how she could get out of there? Hmm. Got a lot going on.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.600
 What was the substance?

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:54.600
 Substance would... 47, recovering alcoholic, prophylactic smoker with a colostomy bag, and now she has heart and liver issues.

00:53:54.600 --> 00:54:02.600
 In a hospital.

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:06.600
 And she wonders what to do?

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:11.600
 Yeah, any ideas for heart and liver issues where she is right now?

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:27.600
 Oh, it's hard to do anything well under hospital care, but she should question everything they propose.

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:31.600
 Yeah, and they'll try to give you a lot of different things, won't they?

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.600
 Mm-hmm.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:39.600
 Yeah, very tough. See if you can get out of there.

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:46.600
 Hi, Dr. Peat. A few months ago, my dog killed a squirrel, and I think it made him sick.

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:51.600
 The next three days, he didn't eat and was having thick black sludge, diarrhea.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:59.600
 He also insisted on staying outside in 20 weather where he would hide in a bush.

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:05.600
 Wow. Since then, he still mostly has diarrhea.

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.600
 Once or twice a week, he won't eat for a whole day.

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.600
 Do you have any ideas on what could be going on?

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:17.600
 I know you're not a veterinarian, but if you had any ideas.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:28.600
 No. Giving him some bland but appetizing food would be my thought.

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:35.600
 Cottage cheese, for example, would do no harm.

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:38.600
 Yeah. She's asking here, and I can respond to this,

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:43.600
 "Do you have any other recommendations other than feeding him other than meat and bones?"

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:49.600
 Well, they're carnivores, in my opinion. I'm not a veterinarian, but they like meat.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:56.600
 And my dog, she'll skip eating sometimes two days in a row.

00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:00.600
 She's perfectly healthy. They know what they don't want to eat,

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:06.600
 so I wouldn't worry about it if they want to skip meals. That's just one idea.

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:14.600
 Some dogs sense when they need carbohydrates,

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:25.600
 having something like a well-cooked vegetable, mashed potato, cottage cheese.

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:31.600
 They'll eat it. If they need it, they'll eat it, right? If they like it.

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:36.600
 And if they don't, they won't. They say, "No, I don't want that. Give me some more meat."

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:53.600
 Even fruits sometimes.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:57:00.600
 Oh, would you please ask Dr. Peat if you can give milk or butter

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:08.600
 as a remedy to safely eating foods with oxalates, more like potatoes?

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:21.600
 Oh, they are slightly protective, just as a kind of a buffer.

00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:31.600
 Undercooked starch, for example, causes much less harm if taken with cream and butter.

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.600
 Cream and butter. And also, would you ask them,

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:39.600
 what's an alternative to such as almond milk or coconut milk for those of us

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:45.600
 who are lactose intolerant or allergic to dairy?

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:54.600
 Well, treating milk with lactase enzyme makes it sweeter

00:57:54.600 --> 00:58:09.600
 and to some extent reduces the effect on helping absorb minerals.

00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:19.600
 Lactose has a direct effect on improving mineral metabolism.

00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:31.600
 And so when you destroy that, you have less ability to handle magnesium and calcium.

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:35.600
 Fair enough. This is from Martin in Montana for Dr. Ray Peat.

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:41.600
 What does Dr. Peat think of cannabis? There's a big push for it in the U.S.

00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:52.600
 Isn't it very estrogenic? And what about short-term versus long-term use and occasional use of cannabis?

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.600
 Short-term versus long-term?

00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:58.600
 Use of cannabis. What do you think about it?

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.600
 Isn't it very estrogenic as well?

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:14.600
 I think mildly so. They have a good lobby promoting its use,

00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:24.600
 but I've never seen a lot of good research supporting it.

00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:30.600
 Any other downsides that you know of other than psychological possibly?

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:40.600
 No, but I've seen lots of annoying people who were exaggerated fans of it.

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.600
 Yeah, there's no doubt about that.

00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:51.600
 Is it possible to grow back joints that have been damaged by osteoarthritis?

00:59:51.600 --> 01:00:06.600
 Oh, yeah, definitely. I've seen it happen. Probably the first one I saw supported by x-ray evidence was Art Plummer,

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:23.600
 who was 65 and had x-rays of his knees that showed there was no whole cartilage layer left, just crumbles.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:33.600
 He said he was retirement age, so he was not going to have his knee joints replaced.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:43.600
 I gave him a bottle of Progest-E, which he, while working on the bathroom plumbing,

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:51.600
 applied it all over his worst knee and went on working.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:01:03.600
 An hour later, I mentioned that he seemed to be having less trouble coming up the steps from his truck.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:11.600
 He said he thought he was, but the next morning he knocked on the door and said,

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:21.600
 "I just wanted to show you this," and he ran down the steps and back up.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:36.600
 About a year later, he had said that he and his wife both needed aspirin to get through the night.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:44.600
 He said that night was their first time in years that they hadn't needed aspirin.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:53.600
 Several months later, I hadn't heard from him again. I phoned his office.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:02:06.600
 His wife answered, "I just wanted to find out about his knees." There was a long pause.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:13.600
 He said, "Oh, that's right. He did have that knee."

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:23.600
 Then, I guess it was about ten years later, I kept seeing his truck around town.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:31.600
 I got him for another job and asked him how his knee had turned out.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.600
 He had totally forgotten that he ever had a knee problem.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:40.600
 And he just did Progest-E's for one time?

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.600
 One week.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:46.600
 Wow. He smeared it all over his knee.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:57.600
 Yeah, the knee, which had no joint to speak of, just rubble.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:03.600
 Overnight, he could run up the stairs without pain.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.600
 That's amazing.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:12.600
 It was so complete that his wife had recovered.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:19.600
 She was a viola player and she had recovered from her hand arthritis

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:25.600
 to the extent that she forgot either of them had had arthritis.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.600
 And she smeared the Progest-E's on her hands as well?

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:34.600
 Yeah, they both used it at bedtime.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.600
 Those are just little bottles. Did he use the whole bottle on his knee?

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.600
 What's that?

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:45.600
 Those are just very small bottles. Did he use the whole bottle on his knee?

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:56.600
 Yeah, the first day, during the hour, he applied half a bottle to that one leg

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:02.600
 from thigh to ankle.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:09.600
 I think all the rest of it came from the rest of that one bottle.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.600
 Very interesting.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:17.600
 A friend of mine told me that you told a story one time about a dog and Progest-E's.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:21.600
 Do you recall what he might be talking about?

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.600
 An animal?

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:31.600
 Some kind of amazing recovery from a dog with Progest-E's?

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.600
 What kind of recovery?

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.600
 Some kind of amazing recovery from something giving a dog Progest-E's?

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:42.600
 Sure, it works in dogs just like people.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:51.600
 Do you remember the story about the dog that you used it on?

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:56.600
 I didn't understand the question.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:06.600
 Did you have an experience that was really interesting with a dog using Progest-E's?

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:27.600
 Oh, yeah, many experiences with dogs. Liver cancer, arthritis, behavior, various human-like problems.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:32.600
 People were putting the Progest-E's topically on the dog?

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.600
 And on their gums.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.600
 And on their gums.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.600
 Hoppy.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.600
 What do you make of that?

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.600
 What could be going on with that?

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.600
 What's such a progesterone doing?

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:52.600
 It's anti-inflammatory at all different levels.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:06:07.600
 And so if they have an excess of cortisol, it will protect against tissue breakdown at the same time as supporting tissue repair.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:12.600
 Wow. How would you know how much or how often to do?

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:27.600
 Oh, it just evolves over. One of the first people was a university basketball player who got tendonitis.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:43.600
 It hurt so much, it impaired his playing. One application to his lower legs and he had no more tendonitis.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:55.600
 And if you were doing something with an animal who had some issues, you would just have to discern in your own intuition of how much to use and how often?

01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:05.600
 Yeah. People who know their dogs like a dog with terminal liver cancer.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:27.600
 Several people have said they thought they were in a terminal condition in agony from the cancer and they said they could tell by their behavior that progesterone made them comfortable.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.600
 Very interesting.

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:32.600
 And they lived for many months.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:37.600
 Here's an email from Chris.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:42.600
 I'm confused about using baking soda for cancer.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:54.600
 I heard Dr. Peate mention in one of your shows that one could use one and a half ounces or 40 grams a day, but I'm not sure how to take it.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:08:02.600
 There are many suggestions on the net using maple syrup and it's not clear what is the best way to take it.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:10.600
 Also, this will change the body's pH, possibly interfering with other things such as food supplements.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.600
 Can you please ask him how to take it?

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:25.600
 Maple syrup contains a lot of allergens. I wouldn't recommend using it without.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:50.600
 There are many different ways to increase your CO2 exposure. Breathing it by just re-breathing your own breath, taking it as the liquid baking soda solution teaspoon at a time,

01:08:50.600 --> 01:09:09.600
 or taking the right balance of thyroid hormone or using the drug acetosolamide to cause your body to retain more CO2.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:20.600
 There are many, many different ways to keep the lactic acid down and the CO2 up.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:24.600
 Okay. Here's one.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:43.600
 Here's a person who had flu symptoms back in November and I've not been able to properly taste or smell since. I've tried taking oregano oil, the blood detox from shed blossom, and oral methylene blue, but still can't seem to smell or taste like I used to.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:56.600
 I was a little concerned that it could be radiation damage or something else. I live in an area with 5G towers, smart meters. What do you think this could be?

01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:11.600
 There's nothing good that the 5G radiation does to your system. It can do lots of harm.

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:19.600
 Yeah, they're tough, aren't they? They're very, very dangerous. Very dangerous.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:32.600
 Here's Anna. After my second COVID injection, wow, I've developed insomnia, muscle spams, and inflammation. The symptoms become even worse during stress and before my period.

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:38.600
 Could this be an autoimmune condition connected with the histamine or estrogen?

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.600
 Yes.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.600
 Wow.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:11:07.600
 The vaccine is ideal for producing autoimmune reactions. Their response is to deny that they cause anything harmful or just absurd and ignorant and insulting to the public.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:14.600
 Yeah. Yeah. It's just terrible.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:19.600
 Can someone apply Progest-East on pimples?

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:28.600
 Some people do.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:41.600
 Here's one. What are Dr. Peat's thoughts on Dr. Young and being more alkaline via veganism?

01:11:41.600 --> 01:12:08.600
 That's just a traditional view of the alkaline, vegetable-heavy diet. It's right as far as the food that goes in is concerned, but just wrong in interpreting what happens inside the cells.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:37.600
 You eat lots of vegetables and get lots of alkaline minerals, and that allows you to convert the bicarbonate of the alkaline vegetable material into the acidic CO2 that protects the insides of cells.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:52.600
 Some of the applications may be okay. Perhaps the interpretation of what's going on may be incorrect in your opinion.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:13:17.600
 Yeah, they're getting lots of bicarbonates, alkaline things, in their diet, but when they eat them, they excrete the alkaline part and keep the bicarbonate, which automatically is turned into intracellular carbon dioxide, which is acidic.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:21.600
 Acidic. Hmm. Hmm. Interesting.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:34.600
 So, when you say the body gets rid of it, I've been doing some baking soda for experimenting the last week or so, and boy, I got my little pH tape just to test my pee, Doc. It's like nine. It's crazy.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.600
 Yeah, that's urine.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.600
 Yeah, that's just urine, right?

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:41.600
 Yeah, that's what's not staying in your body.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.600
 But the good stuff, the carbon dioxide is.

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.600
 Yeah.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:58.600
 Oh, good. All right. Here's an email. Is Tupelo honey a good source of fructose, and does fructose bypass the pancreas? Hmm.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:08.600
 To some extent, yeah. It is less of a trigger to insulin production.

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:14.600
 Tupelo honey, or fructose is less of a...

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.600
 Less stimulating to the insulin.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:20.600
 Yeah. And do you know from Tupelo honey?

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.600
 Oh, any honey.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.600
 What's that?

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:41.600
 It's in any honey. In apple juice, some other fruits, but apple juice and honey are reliable sources.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:15:00.600
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You know, Dr. Fried, I want to mention, too, that since I've been doing more meat and less carbs and oxalates, my fasting blood sugar has been going lower and lower. It's like 70. Is that good?

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.600
 Mm-hmm.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:06.600
 Oh, it can't get too low, right? Or can it?

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:27.600
 It's when you acidify your tissues with the bicarbonates, you're shifting over to the efficient oxidative metabolism.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.600
 And so that deals with the blood sugar better.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:47.600
 Mm-hmm. Which is simply so efficient, you can be using it without having to have such a high level circulating.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:16:10.600
 Yeah. Yeah. You know, another thing I noticed I wanted to ask you about that may be useful to others who are here, when I was doing rice or pasta and even a piece of fish or something and eat, about an hour later, my energy would just go, "Pow!" You know, just down, right?

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:26.600
 Just, I couldn't do much of anything. Couldn't work on my writing works, my writing projects. But with the meat and fat, it just seems to stay level. What is that saying? What's my body telling me there?

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:55.600
 Efficiency allows you to find a middle ground where you don't, when you're under stress, you tend to convert other tissues like proteins into glucose to make sure you have some glucose.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:24.600
 But when you're more efficient in using your glucose, then that lowers the stress, and so you don't need to convert protein or sugar, and so you don't, and it stops destroying your tissue and starts not wasting fuel.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:37.600
 Not wasting fuel. So when you eat carbs and you lose energy, what is that saying? What's going on?

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.600
 When you use carbs.

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:48.600
 Yeah, so you eat carbs and then your energy goes down, like rice or pasta. What is that telling you?

01:17:48.600 --> 01:18:13.600
 That rice is a good stimulant to insulin, but if it doesn't come with inflammation, like if it's polished rice that is non-inflammatory, then that, even though it does stimulate your insulin,

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:29.600
 you're able to use the insulin without any stress. And so when you're using the insulin properly, that's the absence of diabetes.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:34.600
 The absence of diabetes when you're using it properly.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.600
 Yeah.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.600
 Cool. A couple more, then we'll let you go.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:19:03.600
 How much does total phosphorus intake matter if the diet has a good calcium-phosphorus ratio? Is a low phosphorus diet preferable to a normal phosphorus diet if the calcium-phosphorus ratio is exactly the same in both cases?

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:21.600
 There is a range of total intake where the ratio is the important thing rather than the total quantity.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:39.600
 But partly that depends on the efficient use of sugar. Sugar supports the retention effects of calcium.

01:19:39.600 --> 01:20:00.600
 And so if your diet is deficient in sugar and so activates various inflammatory inefficient processes, then that's not good.

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:11.600
 Here's the last one for you, Catherine. Love your show. I'm 35 and my appendix removed at the age of nine after it ruptured from appendicitis.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:22.600
 I've read that the appendix is an immune organ and is involved in replenishing good gut bacteria, digesting fiber, and helping to produce fatty acids.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:32.600
 I'm curious what this means for my metabolic health and how to maximize my health from here on out.

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:47.600
 Fats are the least beneficial part of the system. You're going to have a very low-fat diet that's very safe.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:53.600
 Is there such a thing as a fructose spike?

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:59.600
 Not that I'm aware of.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:05.600
 Well, Dr. Peat, thanks for spending time with us this morning. I appreciate it. Thank you. Happy summer.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:10.600
 Summer solstice is the longest day of the year next year, tomorrow.

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.600
 Okay.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:17.600
 You take care of yourself, sir. Thank you. We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:21.600
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Tempone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:28.600
 I see that our little system to record videos somehow ran out of space.

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:33.600
 So when you see the video of this, it's going to just cut off, but I don't know what to do.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:38.600
 I'll have to get to more geek and work on that, but the audio, you can finish off with it.

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:43.600
 It just ran out a few minutes ago. It'll just cut off kind of weird.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:46.600
 I'm going to tell you.

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:56.600
 Okay, kids, we're going to talk about eating meats and less plants tomorrow with a doctor.

01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:02.600
 He's in Australia. His name is Anthony Chaffey.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:06.600
 And we'll do that tomorrow.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:10.600
 And then Adam Bergstrom will be here on Wednesday.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:16.600
 Adam 2.0, the second or the third Wednesday of the month.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:20.600
 So thank you. I appreciate it. I love you all very much. Thanks for your support.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:27.600
 We will see you tomorrow at 10 o'clock. Take care. Bye-bye.
