00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.920
 Well, a very pleasant good day to you and welcome back. If you heard the first show

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.800
 this morning, we are live here. It is April 12th. I'm sorry. It is April 19th, 2021.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:37.520
 April 19th, 2021. My name is Patrick Timpone. Dr. Kerry Made will be here tomorrow, Tuesday,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:46.720
 on the 20th. Dr. Glenn Swarthout, he's a naturopathic fellow in Hawaii. He's really

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.240
 interesting and he's going to be here on Wednesday and we'll probably have one or two other people

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.960
 this week that we haven't firmed up as yet. Jennifer Daniels next week. Dr. Shiva is going

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.400
 to be here next week and we have a whole lineup actually of next week that not at the tip of my

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.360
 fingertips at the moment, or the tip of my little mind. On the third Monday of each month, we're

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.080
 honored to have Dr. Ray Peat. He's been at this game of looking at health and healing for a very

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:29.920
 long time. Back in the late 1968, he started his work on hormones and did his dissertation in '72.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.040
 He's taught in universities, wrote all kinds of papers, and is just a great researcher that we

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.080
 love talking to him. We always have some good questions. If you have more questions than we

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.520
 have in, we try to get to them all. It's Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com. Dr. Peat's up in the

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.720
 Northwest where you say you're having a little heat wave up there, Doc. Yeah, in the 80s.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.520
 Really? That's unusual for you guys? Very unusual for this time of year.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.520
 How do you say it, Oregonians or whatever? Are they walking around masking, socialing,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.520
 and are they getting out? What's the story up there? Some of them are getting away from it.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:25.600
 I see someone without a mask, but it's still official here. You can see people jogging

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.920
 with a mask on, no one else, within hundreds of feet. Do you have any sense of it after all this

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.640
 time, Dr. Peat? We don't know what's going on, what this thing is, what it is and is.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.320
 Wearing a mask is helping anybody about anything? What's your sense of that?

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:56.080
 There's not really any evidence that it should or does. It could, of course, but

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:06.560
 that's a very weak basis for requiring millions of people. Sure. After all this time, do you have

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:15.680
 a sense of what's really going on here as far as virus or for China or man-made? What do you think?

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:25.920
 So far, I still haven't seen any real evidence of a pandemic. There are lawyers around the world who

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:36.320
 are pursuing the government to reveal the scientific basis for the lockdowns and the masks

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.200
 and all of that. They're keeping it secret if there is any real scientific basis.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.040
 Yesterday, I saw that Michael Yeadon, the former Pfizer vice president,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:06.320
 has made another statement. He says the science behind it is so non-existent that he's

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:18.560
 accepting that there could be other motives. He says, from what's known about the spike protein

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:30.720
 and the RNA so-called vaccines, that it's very probable that they could have long-range

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.080
 degenerative effects, breaking down organs over coming months and years.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:45.920
 One of the possibilities is that it's intended to depopulate the world.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.080
 Yes. And this is a former Pfizer fellow that's saying this?

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:58.240
 Yeah, vice president at Pfizer. And then he was co-founder of a biological company, which I think

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:12.000
 sold later for $225 million or something. So he's had a lot of experience in work relating to viruses

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:23.280
 and vaccines. Was any of this talk from this Pfizer fellow on mainstream at all, have you seen,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:32.320
 or is it just more alternative? Naturally, they censored his videos, but I saw a long talk,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:42.640
 the first one, and people tell me that he's released another video. But when you look him up,

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:56.560
 you find on Google about 20 headlines, Michael Yeadon, a former Pfizer employee of fake news.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.560
 Oh, fake stuff, yeah.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:08.560
 Putting out many derogatory remarks before you can actually find what he said.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.920
 We've heard this term spike protein with this injection. Can you explain just what this is?

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:29.040
 Yeah, the workers at North Carolina in the virus department published several papers, a long series

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:42.800
 about 10 years ago, on how you can remove the nucleic acid section that describes specifically

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:53.760
 the protein that allows the virus to attach to human cell surfaces. So if you inject that into

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:02.240
 an animal virus, you can make it stick to a certain receptor on human cells.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:18.000
 And the current coronaviruses contain this adhesive protein, which in the process of making

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.040
 the virus stick to the surface of our cells, inactivates the protein that it sticks to.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:38.080
 And that protein, the ACE2 enzyme, angiotensin converting enzyme number two, happens to

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:49.840
 be the degrading proteolytic enzyme that breaks down angiotensin 2, which is the promoter of

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:56.560
 high blood pressure, inflammation, degeneration, and all kinds of bad things in our bodies.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:06.720
 And so ACE, the angiotensin converting enzyme, they found that if you block that,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:19.600
 or if you block the actions of the angiotensin 2, the short peptide, that you can relieve high

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:27.120
 blood pressure. And at the same time, it happens to relieve nerve degeneration, they're trying it

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:37.760
 out in Alzheimer's disease, kidney disease, muscle wasting, age-related tissue deterioration, muscle

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:49.200
 shrinkage, everything that aging and stress has been known to do, hypertension, cancer, and all

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:57.920
 of those things are promoted by angiotensin. And so if you block them, you get these very

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:06.160
 surprising therapeutic results. And very early, people found that these blood pressure

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:16.400
 drugs were therapeutic for the coronavirus-infected people. But the medical establishment

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:29.440
 said, "Well, that protein ACE2 enzyme is where the virus sticks. And so if you increase that enzyme,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:39.360
 you're going to make yourself more susceptible to the attachment of the virus." But it happens that

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.720
 if you don't have an abundance of that enzyme, you will have an overproduction,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:54.400
 oversupply of the pro-inflammatory degenerative angiotensin peptide.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:08.560
 So the medical journals for a while were full of advocacy of promoting the blockage of this

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:21.680
 protective enzyme. But the facts turn out the other way. Promoting the ACE2 enzyme turns out

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:27.840
 to be a radically important part of defense against infection and symptoms.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.880
 So then what are we conjecturing then that the folks that are concerned about this

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.720
 injection, this jab, that it's doing exactly then?

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:47.760
 It's causing our own bodies to start producing this horrible spike protein that knocks out our

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:57.440
 basic defensive anti-inflammatory system. And that's the sort of thing that people like Michael

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:08.560
 Eden are talking about. Yeah, it's leaving one of the most horrible possible proteins being produced

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:19.360
 by us adopting the RNA from the virus so that we become virus-like and produce our own toxic

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.320
 pro-inflammatory protein.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.800
 So that's the reason why there's so many arguments with the 10 pennies around and

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.440
 Karimati is going to be in tomorrow and so many other people that there could be some really

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.320
 detrimental long-term effects of this thing.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:43.200
 Yeah, and just out of thin air, people like Fauci say, "Oh, that isn't how the cell works.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:51.520
 The cell can't integrate that in or genes can't keep producing it." Absolutely no evidence for

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:51.840
 that.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.480
 He just says it.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:12:01.520
 Yeah, for 50 years, we've known that our bodies have the reverse transcriptase that can integrate

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:10.160
 it right into our own genes permanently. And a group at Harvard-MIT a few months ago, almost a

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:20.560
 year ago, published in vitro research showing that in fact, human cells can and do incorporate

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:28.720
 the vaccine RNA section into the genes of the cell.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:35.600
 So the CDC, Dr. Peat, they've got to know this, right? I mean, aren't these scientists?

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:45.280
 Yeah, but if you look at the history going back 100 years of the US Public Health Service

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:56.720
 and the CDC, they don't have a good record. If you look at the actual unpublicized things,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:14.080
 experimenting on children going into Guatemala to test dangerous, in fact, orphans, for example,

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:27.280
 to experiment on, it's really just something like out of a horror movie, the actual history of the

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:27.840
 CDC.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:35.760
 So we've had so many people talk about just vaccines in general over the last 18 months.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:48.080
 And this idea that a vaccine, and I guess the live ones without the adjuvants are safer in theory,

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:54.720
 that they disrupt the innate immune system. So do you think that all vaccines do

00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:02.240
 disrupt the innate immune system? That the one that kind of God-given immune system that we have?

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:11.520
 Yeah, to the extent that you over activate the antibody producing system, that sort of the

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:24.480
 most superficial, visible part of the immune system that it really derives from the imaginary

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:34.880
 side chains that Paul Ehrlich intended to sell his drugs at the beginning of the 20th century.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:45.360
 It's a doctrine that came from the chemical industry that turned into the basis of official

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:55.200
 government, corporate description of how immunity works. If you have antibodies supposedly immune,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:07.280
 but meanwhile, actual science was showing that plants have learned immunity. You give them a

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:19.920
 trace vaccination and you sensitize the system. And a few days later, that same trace amount that

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:30.080
 was harmless can become deadly because you've created an allergy. And that same thing happens

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:40.880
 in animals. A trace of something that is harmful, but not deadly can activate an over sensitivity

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:56.880
 that causes sickness. And the junk that goes along with any vaccine is a risk. It's where you create

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:08.400
 experimental allergies in animal. Experimental animals is to give them a little bit of extraneous

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:15.840
 material, wait two weeks, come back and give it again. And you've created an allergic animal.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:26.000
 And so that's one of the side effects of just about any vaccine. And so allergies have been

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.400
 one of the fastest growing problems in the United States. In our culture, just everywhere. And even

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.520
 in the animals, we've had natural docs on that have argued that all these little vaccines they

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:44.000
 give the animals too, some of them itch. For a couple of years, I had one girl that itched for

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.440
 about two or three years before she got over it. Just couldn't stop it. Just itched. Wow.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:59.360
 So I guess in theory, from a real God perspective, anything that we would come in contact with,

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:06.320
 like the plant that you mentioned, if it doesn't kill us, and generally it's not going to, I guess,

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.200
 in general, we're going to figure out how to deal with it? I mean, what?

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:21.680
 Yeah. All of the whole organism, all the different levels, will adjust and toughen up.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.880
 Toughen up. Yeah.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:32.160
 Yeah. So there's not really any part of our organism that isn't involved in immunity and

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:43.840
 resistance. The ability to produce energy efficiently is really our most basic immune process.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:52.880
 And that's every cell, everything in our body, this life force that we embody, chi or spirit or

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:58.320
 gut, whatever you call it, it's all involved in- Resistance.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.360
 Resistance and working with anything that's assaulting it.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.200
 Yeah. Sustaining itself.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.680
 Sustaining itself. That's what it wants to do, right?

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.680
 Yeah. That's what it wants to do.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:21.200
 And there are two well-known, well, counterculture researchers, Polly Matzinger with the danger

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:31.840
 theory of immunity and Jamie Cunliffe with the damage theory of immunity. Cunliffe specifically

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:39.840
 says that our immune system isn't aimed at viruses and germs. It's aimed at restoring

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:52.480
 our own mechanism, maintaining the life process. And that when something damages the tissue, the

00:18:52.480 --> 00:19:03.920
 body goes into a repair process. And that includes things like antibodies, that in the process of

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:15.280
 removing the damaged tissue and creating a repair, integral tissue and organism, in that process,

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:24.080
 the antibodies will take away any bacteria or virus that happened to be involved in damaging

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:31.040
 the tissue. But the aim of the organism is self-sustaining and repair and maintenance,

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:41.520
 not trying to predict any future microorganism that might get into us.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:48.480
 So is this an argument for not to mess with these bodies as little as possible?

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.960
 Yeah. In general?

00:19:52.160 --> 00:20:06.320
 In Africa, the poverty and climate, a very humid, hot climate supports lots of

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:15.200
 possible parasites and infections combined with poverty, as exposed the population to

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:24.720
 lots of challenges. And when we're looking at the so-called AIDS epidemic in Africa,

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:38.640
 turned out that almost everyone had the apparent AIDS or HIV exposure. But the

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:46.560
 really convincing explanation of that was that their immune systems had been overburdened

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:55.520
 and weakened. The self-maintaining and restoring processes had been weakened. And

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:10.960
 the appearance of the extreme degree of infection with the HIV virus was really just a reflection of

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:17.520
 general tissue injury. So they were weakened because of lack of nutrition?

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:25.040
 Yeah. And a tough, just a way to live, whatever, be, I don't know, sanitation and things like that

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:34.160
 in poverty. Yeah. And several big studies have experimented just adding a vitamin D supplement,

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:43.360
 and some others just a vitamin A supplement. And either one of those has made a drastic difference

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.600
 in the background level of infection. Interesting.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.560
 Far better than vaccine campaigns. Wow. So then that's why so many people

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.360
 in Africa technically had the AIDS virus and why they were given

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.520
 these drugs that many people argue is what killed a lot of people.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:14.960
 Yeah. Peter Grysberg proposed that. He said that his experience with viruses, he was really the

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:28.400
 pioneer in a lot of virology ideas. He said he didn't see any way that the HIV could create

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:39.040
 immunodeficiency. And so the reaction was to stop granting him research support and to stop inviting

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.960
 him to conferences so he couldn't speak publicly.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:51.360
 Wow. Fascinating lives. So if you're back 50 years ago and starting a family,

00:22:51.360 --> 00:23:00.640
 would you vaccinate a kid for measles, mumps, rubella and all that? What would you do?

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:09.200
 No, no, no. When I was a kid, these issues were just like now. There was a counterculture.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:19.120
 And in the 1940s and 50s, there were people warning about the dangers, warning about polio.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:25.520
 There are many publications all the way back to the beginning of the 20th century

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:36.400
 showing that injecting anything into the muscle, even vitamins injected intramuscularly,

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.920
 preceded the outbreaks of paralytic polio.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.960
 Preceded the outbreaks, right?

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.640
 Yes, the injections.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:58.160
 When they looked at the kids that came down with paralysis, for example, in a particular leg or arm,

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:05.920
 it would turn out that that had been the site of some kind of injection, vitamin injections or

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:16.880
 vaccinations. Wow. And there's people out there arguing that DDT played a role in this whole polio

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.880
 thing. Do you know anything about that? DDT?

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.160
 Yeah. Oh, sure.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:29.920
 Oh, sure. It damages. It's an estrogenic substance.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:39.120
 And one of the things that the spike protein does, creating increased

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:51.040
 androtensin. Androtensin increases estrogen. It activates the aromatase enzyme as well as the

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:58.880
 prostaglandin synthesis enzyme. Then prostaglandin in turn activates aromatase,

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:08.000
 starts a whole cascade towards producing more estrogen. And so androtensin and

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:22.240
 estrogen symptoms turn out to be very parallel. And so DDT or the various plasticizers

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:30.800
 that are filling the environment now, these have strong estrogen-like effects.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.440
 And so they overlap with the effects of the virus.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:40.800
 So all these poisons, maybe Roundup or any kind of poison, toxins,

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:47.120
 these are turning out to be really the chief culprits with what we call disease.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.200
 Yeah. Weakening the restorative energetic system.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.560
 Weakening the restorative androgenic system?

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.840
 Energetic.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:04.240
 Energetic system. Okay. What we were talking about, Dr. Chi, the life force that weakens it.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.280
 Yeah.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:11.680
 Weakens it. Which is what happens when we eventually die, right? The life force gets so low

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.480
 when we just die, right?

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.440
 That's what I've been writing about in my newsletters the last several months.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.080
 Oh, really?

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:30.320
 What is it that causes us to gradually or more or less suddenly, after about 70 or 80 years to-

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.120
 To just die.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:37.280
 Yeah. Start having a collapse of that restorative energy system.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:49.360
 And basically I've been arguing that it's the accumulative effects of adapting to defective

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:57.760
 systems. So one of the things you can see in the environment is the altitude effect.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:07.760
 When you're at low altitude, where most people live along the coast, the oxygen pressure is

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:16.240
 much, much higher than the developing embryo and fetus experience.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:28.800
 And at the same time, that high oxygen tension at sea level drives out our CO2 that we produce,

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:36.320
 but that the gestating fetus can retain being enclosed in the uterus.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.000
 The oxygen is much lower and the CO2 much, much higher.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:54.720
 And that balance favors the fantastic development from one cell to this high metabolizing big-brained

00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:03.760
 baby at birth with a metabolic rate two or three times higher than an older individual.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:16.160
 So this extreme support for perfect development, preventing scarring if there's a tissue injury

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:25.040
 during gestation, the high CO2, low oxygen tension prevents the formation of scar tissue.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:31.600
 But once you get out in this excessively oxygenated environment,

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:40.480
 injuries tend to form scar tissue rather than good maintenance, complete repair.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:54.080
 So where the highly energized, vital, young and resistant system produces tissue restoration

00:28:54.080 --> 00:29:03.120
 without scarring, the weaker you are, the poorer your nutrition or the more toxic exposures,

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:12.640
 the more likely you are to replace good tissue that's injured with more or less scar tissue.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.920
 - Scar tissue, wow.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:22.560
 - And aging consists of a shift from vital functioning cells to fibrotic

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:28.400
 inflammation, scar-like tissues.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:34.240
 - But it doesn't seem like it's really a natural process, aging.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:40.720
 I mean, aren't we kind of wired up to live happily and scar-free for a lot longer than

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.160
 we are doing as a culture?

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:51.680
 - Yeah, I think one of the things that causes that is that our environment now has too much

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.840
 oxygen, not enough carbon dioxide.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.080
 - Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.960
 How can we retain more carbon dioxide?

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.520
 - Moving to 8,000 or 9,000 feet.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.360
 - 8,000 feet, there you go.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.840
 - Yeah, Leadville, Colorado, if you can adapt to it.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.560
 - Wow.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:20.480
 - The heart disease, cancer and dementia rate, every 1,000 feet higher you live in altitude,

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.120
 the lower the cancer and heart disease.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.400
 - Is that right?

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:33.680
 So just because more CO2 is retained, so when we exercise, how can we...

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:33.920
 - We're raising...

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.120
 - We're actually getting rid of CO2, right?

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.280
 - If it's bad exercise.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.480
 - Bad exercise.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.400
 What would be good exercise in your opinion?

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.520
 - Anything that raises your body temperature.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:54.800
 It turns out that the good exercise that has prolonged effects is anything that raises your

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.800
 body temperature by muscle heat production.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:09.280
 And they've compared exercise to just warming the body and you get the same anti-inflammatory,

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:19.760
 anti-heart disease effects, anti-cancer effects and so on, just by getting your body temperature

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.600
 up, which good exercise does.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.160
 - And in your opinion, good exercise is?

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.840
 - Heat producing.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.640
 - Heat producing, which would be examples?

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:35.040
 - Muscle-resistant exercise.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:35.840
 - Lifting weights.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.640
 - Lifting weights or walking.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.280
 - Walking.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:44.560
 - Or running in short bursts, but it's the prolonged,

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:54.080
 breathless kind of exercise where you become very hypocathletic, very deficient in carbon dioxide.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:32:01.680
 - So if we can figure out how to exercise without not breathing, or breathing normally,

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.360
 or not even breathing as much, then we're doing good, right?

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.080
 Because we're not getting rid of carbon dioxide.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.240
 - Yeah, you're increasing carbon dioxide.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.440
 - You're increasing, right.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:18.400
 - And that decreases the inflammatory production of lactic acid.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:24.240
 - And we can do that as our heart and our muscles and blood vessels get stronger, right?

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.040
 - Mm-hmm.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:29.200
 - Right, then we can retain more of that carbon dioxide.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:35.680
 - Yeah, and the muscle adaptation to exercise increases the volume of the muscle

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:42.720
 and the ability of the muscle to produce protective steroid hormones

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:47.280
 rather than destructive estrogenic hormones.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.080
 - Fascinating.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:53.360
 So that's why so many of those people, remember early on, Doc, when the whole

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.640
 jogging thing was like the rage, right?

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.200
 And boy, these guys were dropping like flies, you know?

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:04.960
 They were, well, not like flies, but you know, I guess the most famous guy was James Fix.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.920
 And he was running, you know, 25 miles at a time.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:13.920
 But don't those folks down in Africa, don't, well, maybe they don't run for 25 miles, right?

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.520
 They probably just walk a lot.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:28.800
 - Yeah, and in areas of northern Mexico, there are people who have to travel 20 or 30 miles a day.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:37.280
 And they do it at a rate that they, besides it's at a high altitude.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:45.280
 So the high altitude makes it possible to be more active once you're adapted.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:45.840
 - Yeah.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.240
 - And still retain your CO2.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:53.920
 - We heard from Stephanie Seneff, she's got a new book out, Doc, on glyphosates.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:59.360
 And she says that Mexico is going to be completely banning incoming and outgoing

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.520
 glyphosates in the next two or three years.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.480
 - Very good.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.600
 - Interesting, right?

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:03.840
 Wow.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.080
 - Yeah.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.000
 - We may need to move down there.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.800
 You know, I just wanted to give a quick little heads up, because remember I told you that,

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.520
 oh, I guess about six months ago, after talking to you, I thought, well, maybe I'll get a little

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:22.800
 bit of this, you know, thyroid thing from this place in Mexico that you plugged, you know,

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.680
 because I looked at the TSA, well, maybe I need something.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.080
 So I didn't, you know, didn't get it.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.320
 And it showed up somewhere in Chicago.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.680
 I got a letter from the FDA.

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:36.000
 And, you know, they said, you can't have it because whatever, you know.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.240
 So I just thought it was God's way of saying, I don't need it.

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.400
 And my thyroid's fine.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:46.080
 But I just wanted to tell you it was kind of good news because about a month ago, I got a phone

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.240
 call from these people in Mexico.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.920
 Is that, what was the name of the place?

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.440
 Is that Pharmaco?

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:51.920
 What's the one?

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.720
 - Pharmacio Del Nino.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.080
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.200
 And they were very nice.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.520
 And they said, well, we got your thyroid thing back.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.920
 And would you like it or would you like your money back?

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.520
 So I just want to throw that out there because they're a very reputable company.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.640
 I mean, they didn't have to do that.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.240
 I would have never known, right?

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.760
 So it's pretty good.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:19.920
 - Yeah, quite a few people have sent them cash and envelope and get their order.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.200
 - And they get their order.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.680
 So it seems like it is a, what's the name of the pharma, say it again?

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.000
 - Pharmacio Del Nino.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.840
 - Yeah, Pharmacio Del Nino.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.160
 - Yeah.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:35.200
 - Yeah, so that's a reputable company at any rate.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.000
 Doc, stay right there.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.760
 Let's do a quick little break here.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:44.080
 And then we'll get into some emails for Dr. Ray Peat, who's here on the third Wednesday,

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.880
 a third Monday of every month on oneradionetwork.com.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.440
 Here's a great product if you've never tried it.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:56.080
 Previously with Daniel Vitalis, we were talking about pine pollen.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:01.200
 - Pollen is essentially the equivalent of what an animal would have as sperm.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.760
 Pollen is like the male part, the semen.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.800
 And it fertilizes the ovum of the flower, which becomes eventually a fruit.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.120
 And so if we were going to draw the equivalence, it would be like that the flower is like the

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:18.400
 female sex organ and the pollen is like the male sexual ejaculate.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:24.000
 Well, pine trees, which sort of just dominate so much of the landscape of North America and

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.240
 so much of the world, pine trees, their semen, they dust the landscape in pollen.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:35.360
 And that pollen being the sort of male part of the plant has some correspondences to

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:40.240
 male physiology in our species and many other animal species.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:47.200
 So what I'm saying is pine pollen contains all of these different anabolic androgenic hormones.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:53.360
 Plant versions of hormones that we need like testosterone, like DHEA.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.560
 - Well, the birds and the bees and the flowers and the trees.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.800
 Good stuff, guys, and for you girls too.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:04.640
 Several choices of pine pollen, any Sir Thrive will link, oneradionetwork.com.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.920
 And right along with that is another great company that we love.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.640
 I just ordered some more of their products.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.080
 I use a lot of both of these.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.320
 Pine pollen, I love it.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:23.360
 And also Shen Blossom, if you look on their website, go through One Radio Network,

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:31.600
 you'll see things like goji, schizandra, ho-shu-wu, turmeric formulas, velvet pearl,

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:41.920
 deer antler, wild purple reishi, wild premium grade ginseng extract, 50-year-old ginseng,

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:46.240
 hello, medicinal mushroom formulas, goji berry formulas.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:51.280
 Now these folks are made exquisitely by Brandon Amelani.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.680
 I mean, they're just the real deal, baby.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.840
 They are the real deal.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:02.560
 And he doesn't fool around with anything that's going to even come close to your body not liking,

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:08.640
 for they're all food-based, herb-based, mushroom, these kinds of things.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:15.680
 The Max Planck Institute organization said many years ago that you don't want to put

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:19.600
 anything in your body unless it's from a real, once living source.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:23.280
 I think that's kind of true, but what do I know?

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.320
 It's Shen Blossom.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.120
 It's a great product.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:33.680
 They're all in my ring glass on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.320
 Shen Blossom, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:44.960
 About a month ago, I purchased an Air Doctor, air filter machine from our website.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.160
 I clicked on it just like you do.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.200
 Yeah, I paid for them too.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:51.360
 And it's really interesting.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.960
 It's a wonderful unit.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.400
 I think it's been two months now.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:02.400
 And it's a little bit bigger than what would be a classic Dell computer, you know, tower unit.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.480
 A little bit thicker, a little bit taller.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.400
 Extremely quiet.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.440
 It's all automatic.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:14.000
 You can cook a little bacon up there and all of a sudden the smoke will come up and, you know,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.160
 the fumes from the bacon and all of a sudden you'll hear your little air purifier maybe 20 feet away.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:27.200
 It'll just crank up its fan and just work harder a little bit until it gets all the smoke and

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.520
 everything out and then it turns back to normal.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.640
 It's got little lights on it.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.680
 You don't have to do anything.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.440
 So quiet.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:39.760
 It'll tell you when you need to change the filters that are incredibly easy to filter,

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.200
 change, it gets rid of all kinds of stuff.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.160
 100% stuff of stuff that you just don't want.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.920
 Toxic chemicals, things in the air.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.620
 Who knows?

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:55.760
 Since we've been opening the windows here because of the weather,

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.920
 every now and then I'll hear it just not cooking.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.640
 It'll just kind of turn on for five minutes or so.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.960
 Maybe there's something coming in from some pollen or something that it thinks

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.200
 I shouldn't breathe.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.680
 I don't have an issue but, you know, maybe it's smarter than I am.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.400
 I don't know.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.680
 So it gets rid of it.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:16.400
 And very clever, very interesting technology.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.760
 Extremely quiet.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.280
 It's called the Air Doctor.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.960
 It's on the front page of oneradionetwork.com.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.720
 I think you'll enjoy it if you've been thinking about getting an air purifier in your home.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.000
 Very, very well constructed.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.040
 Classy unit.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.680
 Just so pleased to be able to talk about them.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.600
 We are listener supported.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.040
 One Radio Network.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.960
 We talked with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.800
 It is rayPeat.com.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:51.360
 You can get his newsletter, which is rayPeatsnewsletter.com, right?

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.880
 No, at gmail.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.080
 At gmail.com, yeah.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.600
 Ray Peat's newsletter at gmail.com.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.320
 And your latest one you've been talking about of why we die?

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:14.720
 Basically, that isn't the title, but it's looking at the process of adapting badly.

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:15.440
 Adapting bad.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:21.840
 And how great a factor do you think it is

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.560
 when people get to be around 60, 70, 80 or whatever,

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.400
 and start to think that they don't have much to live for, right?

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.760
 I don't know.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:36.240
 It's got to be huge on the organism, isn't it?

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.380
 Yeah.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:45.120
 Animal experiments show that isolation or the creation of hopelessness,

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:49.360
 the expectation that you don't have a future,

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.520
 that very process, simple isolation,

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:58.080
 turns on the pro-inflammatory processes,

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:03.760
 creates tissue inflammation, accelerating tissue degeneration.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:08.560
 Just the idea that, "Well, I don't have much going on.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.600
 I don't know what I'm going to do.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.920
 Maybe I'll watch TV."

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.160
 It's just going to damage the tissues.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:20.080
 Yeah, it turns down the energy system and raises the inflammation process.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:20.580
 Wow.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.520
 Isn't that fascinating, huh?

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.600
 Yeah, fascinating.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.400
 It's part of the adaptive process.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:37.200
 If you don't intend to keep adapting to interesting, exciting stuff, then...

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.280
 New stuff, right?

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.080
 Yeah.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.480
 So, if we're telling our body that we're not interested in adapting,

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.520
 we're just going to, I don't know, go hide or something or escape,

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:50.660
 it's...

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.920
 The body will get weaker?

00:42:51.920 --> 00:43:00.720
 Yeah, it accommodates the process and turns down your interest and ability to keep adapting.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.960
 And then what would be the opposite end of that,

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.680
 of some folks, and we've all been through it, I guess,

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:12.560
 we could go through a hypochondriac kind of stage of trying to do so much stuff

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.760
 that that could work in the opposite way too, right?

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.000
 Because we get afraid of stuff.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:19.920
 Uh, yeah, yeah.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:25.280
 That's a part of the same process.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:25.920
 Same process.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:33.760
 Looking at the body as a machine rather than as a self with plans.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.480
 As a self with plans?

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:36.960
 Yeah.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:37.840
 Yeah, that's great.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.000
 Okay, you want to take some emails?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.120
 Okay.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:41.760
 Okay, here we go.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:50.320
 Dr. Peat, many herbalists and naturopaths recommend the herb milk thistle for liver health and repair.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:57.520
 I find online that is estrogenic, so no surprise that it knocks down my libido each time I've used

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:03.120
 it. Hmm, as an alternative, I started using NAC for liver protection.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:09.920
 I know that cysteine is one of the amino acids that Dr. Peat cautions against getting too much of.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:15.280
 So what does he recommend to protect the liver from, say, alcohol abuse or prescription drugs

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.040
 and living on planet Earth without affecting my libido?

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:32.720
 In experiments with alcohol toxicity, alcohol exposure creates basically a fatty, scarred

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:43.440
 liver. The immediate antidote to alcohol poisoning of the liver or other tissues is fructose.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:53.600
 There have been people saying fructose is poison like alcohol, but in fact, it's the opposite.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:45:04.160
 It's an antidote to alcohol poisoning. And so fat metabolism doesn't produce as much

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:15.200
 carbon dioxide as sugar or starch metabolism. And so as long as you can keep oxidizing starch and

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:22.640
 sugar effectively, you're producing the protective carbon dioxide. And anything that makes you

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:33.120
 shift the balance away from oxidation and carbon dioxide is harmful. And too much

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:46.640
 reductive balance, if you look at the niacin-related metabolites, NADH and NAD,

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:55.680
 the healthy oxidizing cell has a higher ratio of NAD to the reduced NADH.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:08.320
 But a lot of the whole 70 or 80 years of thinking about the dangers of oxidative peroxidation

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:16.560
 started with the realization that polyunsaturated fatty acids oxidize spontaneously

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:27.040
 and cause toxic effects. So this whole culture of fearing oxidation and wanting

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:35.840
 antioxidant processes or reductive processes have promoted the idea that things like

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:47.760
 reducing agents like cysteine or glutathione has been a big thing. Inject glutathione because it's

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:59.840
 a so powerfully antioxidant. But in fact, the reductive stress turns out to be the real

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:09.200
 harm done even by what they thought was oxidative stress. Because when you fail to oxidize vigorously,

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:19.600
 the excess electrons find their way to iron atoms, for example, that have been harmless.

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:26.880
 The electron excess turns the iron into an oxidative destructive center.

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:39.600
 So the tendency to fail to oxidize turns on the process of random destructive oxidation.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:50.400
 And substances like the flavonoids that you find in fruits and vegetables and milk,

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:59.920
 if the cow has been eating well, these bioflavonoids activate the cells oxidative processes.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:10.080
 Even though they had been sold as reductants and dioxins, their effect on the cell is to increase

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:22.240
 oxidation of the good sort and to consume electrons faster. And by that, to reduce the

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:32.880
 random destructive oxidation. And so if you just put in more cysteine or more glutathione

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:45.040
 or even too much vitamin C, the vitamin C that's effective and working in the cell

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:55.840
 is as a pro-oxidant. It's dehydroascorbate that works in the healthy cell. Cancer cells shift

00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:02.640
 to a reduced form of all of these things, glutathione, cysteine,

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:13.920
 ascorbic acid itself rather than dehydroascorbate. So the healthy tissue is on the balance

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:22.800
 continuously slightly oxidizing process. - So that's why you've never been a big fan of just

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:31.840
 doing lots of vitamin C or any vitamin C really? - No, Linus Pauling pointed out that

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:41.200
 the gorillas, for example, who can't synthesize vitamin C the same as people,

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:49.360
 they on their natural diet are consuming about 4,000 milligrams of vitamin C a day.

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:58.160
 All of the animals on a natural diet have consumed the equivalent of 3,000 or 4,000

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:06.320
 milligrams of vitamin C just in ordinary foods, milk, meat, eggs, all of those things. If the

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:14.640
 animal was alive, it was producing its own vitamin C. - But it's out of food and not from

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:23.200
 like ascorbic acid. - Yeah, if you put in too much ascorbic acid, you can run the risk. Same with

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:32.960
 intravenous injections of glutathione. Any strong excess of a reductant in the bloodstream can

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:41.360
 create oxidative damage. For example, an experiment, a free radical chemist

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:54.240
 was testing the reagent grade purest available vitamin C, much higher standards than USP vitamin

00:50:54.240 --> 00:51:07.440
 C, put a gram of that in a liter of ultra-distilled water and found in an apparatus to measure free

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:18.880
 radicals that it was producing from the vitamin C and whatever trace metals were contaminating the

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:26.320
 highly purified vitamin C that in distilled water, it was producing free radicals at the rate

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:35.600
 that a killing dose of x-rays would produce. Just the slightest trace of iron, for example,

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:44.720
 that was the particular metal that the free radical chemist identified reacting with the

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:55.680
 ascorbic acid. And in your body, when you have an excess of reduced vitamin C taken in, it finds

00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:06.720
 copper and iron and that reacting couple will inevitably find some polyunsaturated fat

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:16.000
 to make rancid instantly. So the combination of a trace of iron or copper plus vitamin C

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:25.360
 plus fat creates extreme lipid peroxidation. - So is that an argument for maybe giving blood

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:30.240
 now and again to get rid of some of that excess iron if we have it? - Oh, yeah, that's one of the

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:36.640
 benefits. - To give some blood. So that's where the whole bloodletting thing at one point came from?

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:47.920
 - Years ago. - It turns out to just, people felt better after donating blood very often.

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:56.640
 They experimented on animals and found that old decrepit dogs, for example, could be rejuvenated by

00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:03.680
 exchanging, taking the blood out, washing it, putting the red blood cells back in without the

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:14.400
 serum and doing that repeatedly. Washing the blood removed a lot of their aged qualities.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:26.320
 And if you join the circulatory systems of an old rat and the young rat, the old rat's life is

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:34.240
 extended while the young rat goes through its lifespan. - Going back to the fructose, so is that

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:42.400
 one of the reasons, Dr. Ray Pied, why you're such a fan of orange juice? - Yeah, but the flavonoids

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:50.880
 are another. - And that's in milk, right? - Orange juice and milk are very safe ways to get

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:59.600
 very high intake of the bioflavonoids. - Bioflavonoids. So where did all this stuff

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:03.360
 come about that we should be drinking milk over the years? I mean,

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:11.120
 wow, where'd all that come from? Anti-milk stuff. Yeah, it's crazy, isn't it? - Yeah,

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:22.800
 my aunt was a nurse trained in the 1920s and '30s, and she was indoctrinated to not breastfeed.

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:28.720
 - Really? Not breastfeed? Wow. - And that was a big medical thing that

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:39.360
 there was some kind of supposedly biological stigma against breastfeeding, and so they were

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:49.760
 feeding them artificial milk. And the idea of making milk out of seeds, almonds, soybeans,

00:54:49.760 --> 00:55:00.560
 and so on, developed out of that baby food culture, turning it over to industry rather than the mother.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:06.880
 - You said, oh, go ahead. - That developed, I think it has

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:15.440
 Freudian implications in the motivation that people are so fearful of milk.

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:20.800
 - You had mentioned earlier about well-fed cows, so are we just talking about

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:25.280
 grass-fed because of not grass-fed, you just don't know what they're eating?

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:36.720
 - Yeah, fresh grass has the most, the highest content of flavonoids. Hay is fairly good,

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:46.720
 so dried grass still has lots of stuff. A highly grain-concentrated diet is the worst.

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:50.960
 - And you can actually, if you don't have a source locally, you can actually get,

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:56.880
 I've seen organic grass-fed milk at Whole Foods. I mean, you can actually buy it if you want.

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.880
 - Mm-hmm, yep. - You can buy it if you want.

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:05.040
 - And the flavonoids are a great virtue. - Are in there. So that's another good

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:09.920
 argument to find grass-fed butter, like the ones we get from Ireland.

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:13.920
 - Exactly, even butter will contain these flavonoids.

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:24.560
 - Ben wants to know, he's 71, Dr. Peat, he wants to know best regime to increase low testosterone

00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:29.520
 and gain more muscle. So he's 71, but he's not going anywhere, he wants more muscle and more

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:37.200
 testosterone. Your fave things? - Yeah, shift the diet away from fats to

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:42.240
 some extent. Increase the carbohydrates. - Carbohydrates?

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:51.920
 - Especially, yeah, orange juice is just the best. Any carbohydrate is better than more fat.

00:56:51.920 --> 00:57:00.960
 - Really? So many people say fats are so good for us, but talk about that a bit.

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:13.520
 - The saturated fats, going back to Hans Selye's experiments in which the rapeseed oil was

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:22.720
 considered to be heart-toxic, so they developed canola oil with, I think it was a rucic acid

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:30.320
 that was reduced, but Hans Selye showed that it was linoleic acid, which is still too high in

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:40.000
 canola oil. He showed that the high polyunsaturated fats were what were causing heart cell death.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:48.480
 It would slice up the rat's heart after they had eaten a high PUFA diet and find dead heart cells

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:55.120
 all through the tissue. But then he fed them, besides the same amount, he didn't reduce the

00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:04.560
 PUFA, but he added a lot of cocoa butter, which is very high in sturic acid, and just getting the

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:14.960
 highly saturated long-chain fat to balance and protect against the PUFA, he eliminated the heart

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:19.920
 death. - So, be good for us to have a little

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:29.200
 cocoa butter, you can actually buy that too. - Yeah, I just got some of a deodorized, the

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:36.080
 odor stuff sometimes can be very allergenic, so you want to test chocolate or cocoa butter.

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:41.520
 - And that's just made, it's kind of white, isn't it, Doc? And it's just made from cacao,

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:46.400
 or we're all chocolate, right? - Yeah, if you have the unrefined

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:52.160
 cocoa butter, it's white, but it tastes like chocolate, so you can make a white chocolate.

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:58.080
 - And you can put those in your smoothies too, right? If you want to make fruit smoothies?

00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:06.800
 - Yeah, but it's important to check for allergenicity of even natural cocoa, because

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:12.640
 the different ways that it's fermented and prepared can cause allergies.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:18.880
 - So, back on the mussels, and the more, you say more carbs, does that include

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:25.280
 rice or pasta too, for mussels, or not? Are you just talking about more fruit?

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:33.360
 - Fruit is higher in the protective flavonoids. The grains are very low in them.

00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:47.200
 But then the protein should be adequate. You don't want too much of the methyl donors.

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:59.760
 The age-promoting amino acids are mostly cysteine and methionine, so you want just a moderate amount

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:12.720
 of those. And then the type of muscle activity, like using dumbbells and squats, just a few of

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:24.560
 those, like 10 repetitions of dumbbells and 10 squats or sit-ups, will build muscle volume.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:30.000
 - And then what about animal fats, pork fat or beef fat and things like that?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:40.720
 - Beef fat is rich in stearic acid and monounsaturated, which are safe. Pork fat

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:52.400
 can go all the way up into the 30% linoleic acid, which is very age-promoting. But there's

01:00:53.360 --> 01:01:02.080
 one pork farm in Maryland that has experimented feeding a good high-carbohydrate diet to their

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:11.520
 pigs, and they got their PUFA content all the way down to 4%, where beef fat sometimes is as high

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:20.800
 as 3%. So their pork was very competitive with beef for safety and high stearic acid content.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:28.320
 - So the pigs that are fed maybe GMO corn and other stuff could be a real issue, but if you

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:34.240
 find a farmer that's doing more vegetarian and more fruit and vegetables and stuff, it could

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.840
 just be fine. - Yeah.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:43.440
 - Yeah. That's cool, man. So smoothies are good for us, right? Fruit smoothies?

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:53.600
 - Yeah, as long as you don't put raw seeds and nuts and raw vegetables in them.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.280
 - And all that stuff. Yeah. You don't need all that stuff.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:04.400
 "What's the best thing we can do," writes Carol, "for a system that is usually alkaline?"

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.800
 Oh, I guess she's feeling she's too alkaline. Are vegetables okay?

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:23.040
 - Yeah, cooked vegetables are a way of getting your well-balanced carbohydrates, but

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:35.280
 proteins are the main thing that acidifies our system. So if your urine is slightly acidic,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:44.000
 you're much less likely to get kidney stones than a high alkaline diet. So the people on a

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:54.080
 very vegan or excessively vegetarian diet tend to get a lot of kidney stones because the

01:02:54.080 --> 01:03:00.400
 material crystallizes and deposits at a higher pH.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:05.520
 - I see. So our urine wants to be more in the 5-6 range.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:15.440
 - Yeah. And exercise-producing carbon dioxide is one of the things that will help to keep your

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:26.000
 blood and urine slightly on the acidic side. Well, not acidic for the blood, but the less alkaline

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:37.120
 system, higher carbon dioxide, slight tendency towards hypercapnia is highly protective to all

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.480
 of your cells. - We're with Dr. Ray Peat. He's here on the

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:47.200
 third Monday of every month. You can go on our website and see all the different interviews,

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:54.480
 fascinating, good material. RayPeat.com, his newsletter, Ray Peat's newsletter at gmail.com.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:01.040
 It's very affordable. You can email that email and he'll set you up and get his newsletter.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:09.200
 Here's an interesting question, Dr. Peat, from Ryan on this 19th day of April. "My girlfriend's

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:16.000
 cycle has shortened to three weeks the last couple of months. Lots of unvaccinated women are

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:23.200
 apparently reporting this recently after their friends have got vaccinated." What? "Could they be

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:29.280
 passing anything from the vaccinating? Many coincidences, but a lot of people are talking

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:34.880
 about any scientific reasoning behind this." - People have been contacting me about that.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:40.240
 - Yeah, and I've seen stories too. Now, is it possible these vaccine-injected people

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:47.520
 are shedding something to girls? - It's an obvious possibility.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:58.560
 People haven't done testing of swabs of their skin or condensing their exhaled breath and so on,

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:06.080
 but it's a very definite possibility that exactly as the virus can be

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:15.920
 exhaled or put into the sweat and urine, the vaccine obviously can go the same route.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:28.560
 The spike protein by knocking out ACE2 enzyme increases enthotensin. Enthotensin increases

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:41.440
 aromatase and estrogen and prostaglandins. Estrogen and prostaglandins are deeply involved

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:49.920
 in regulating the menstrual cycle, creating PMS and dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea,

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:59.680
 changing of the length of the cycle and so on. - And you have been contacted by ladies that are

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:06.240
 experiencing some shortened cycles? - Yeah, just recently. - Just recently. So, is it possible that

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:11.680
 people getting this injection could actually breathe out stuff we don't want or share it?

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:25.920
 - It's logically just as possible as with the viral material. Our breath contains the most surprising

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:34.000
 assortment of chemicals, peptides, bits of nucleic acid, exactly the sort of

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:45.440
 thing that could carry virus-like fragments of RNA. You can even find isoprene in exhaled breath.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:53.200
 - Well, this is crazy. Maybe we'll get to the point where all the unvaccinated people

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.200
 have some kind of a passport showing how healthy they are or something.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:06.240
 - Yeah, that's implied by people like Michael Eden. - Yeah, this could be where we're going.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:13.280
 Wouldn't it be something if all ended up like that a few years from now? My goodness. Well,

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:17.600
 here's, let's see. Hi, Dr. Peat. I know that you've mentioned Zach Bush in a past show.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:26.640
 He makes a product called Ion Gut Health. The ingredients are aqueous humic substances. Do

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:37.280
 you think there could be any value in taking this? - No. Humic substances are just a component of

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:45.600
 dirt, which it's probably harmless. - Yeah, probably harmless. So,

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.640
 people have been arguing that actually if you had an organic garden, you don't necessarily have to

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.160
 wash the vegetables that well. Do you think that's true? - That's true.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:08:01.760
 - Is it? You get a little bit of good stuff in there? - Yeah, a little dirt is completely harmless.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:09.600
 - Kids eat dirt all the time, right? My wife's recent CAT scan with no contrast showed a mild

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:18.000
 mucosal thickening on the right side of the sphenoid sinus. Should she be concerned? If so,

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:26.320
 what would you suggest from Henry? - Allergies will cause a thickening.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:39.680
 Something you ate getting into the blood, the endotoxin from bad digestion will circulate

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:48.160
 through your body, causing sinus membranes, nasal membranes, lungs, everything to thicken up.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:59.600
 And have symptoms of inflammation, itching, burning, all of the inflammatory symptoms.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:07.600
 - We're with Dr. Ray Peat. This is the 19th of April. Next week, Dr. Jennifer Daniels,

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:13.840
 is a lady who's going to talk about the illusionary benefits of the fourth industrial revolution

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:20.640
 that is being promoted by the World Economic Forum. Also, Dr. Shiva, you've heard of him,

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:26.320
 Forest Rivers, who's talking about how this is a great awakening. Just hold on, it's going to be

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:32.480
 okay. And Richard Mayberry is going to be here. So we have a full week for you next week. Here's

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:42.800
 an email. Is cultured butter a health asset? What about kefir? - Oh, kefir is probably okay

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:52.240
 if it isn't very sour. If it has too much lactic acid, a large, like drinking a pint of it, can

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:58.880
 upset your liver and give you a headache. So you just have to be cautious with the quantity and the

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:10.240
 acid content. But there's really no benefit from culturing butter. They add strange industrial

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:20.000
 microorganisms byproducts to change the flavor, I guess. But butter itself, just the pure,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:30.960
 fresh form that condenses when you shake up slightly sour milk, the milk, if it's naturally

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:37.360
 soured, has bacteria culture in it. - Do you think there's any, if you have raw,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.480
 say grass-fed milk, a goat or cow, that you can just leave it up on the counter in room

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:50.720
 temperature and let it do stuff? Does that make good things? - Yeah, that's the way we would make

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:59.040
 cottage cheese, for example. And if you want to make butter, you can let it stand for a few hours

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:08.400
 and still have sweet butter. But the idea of buttermilk was because if you left it out

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:19.920
 for eight or 10 hours, it would start growing bacteria. The bacteria would fall in from the air

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:28.480
 even if they didn't come from the cow. And the souring milk would create a faster making of the

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:40.080
 butter. - Is goat milk close to being benefited as cow milk, similar? - Yeah, and largely it's the

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:49.600
 diet. - It's a diet. - Goats prefer grazing on leaves and are more reluctant to eat stuff like

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:59.440
 a high-grain-based diet. And so their milk will have a lot more of the flavonoids than the average

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:07.440
 grain-fed cow milk. - Do you think if you had a goat or a cow that was eating genetically modified

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.720
 or just glyphosate-laden food, which a lot of the corn and stuff is, that could be an issue?

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:19.360
 - Oh, for sure. - For sure, you don't want to do that, right? - No. - Okay, Mike wants to know,

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:29.280
 "Recent studies show the anti-inflammatory benefits of specialized pro-resolving mediators, SPMs,

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:36.800
 which are cell signaling subclass of omega-3 PUFAs." I know Dr. Peat stands on PUFAs,

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:44.880
 but is there a place for using SPMs in managing inflammation? - A couple of researchers,

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:57.200
 one of them named Sethi, S-E-T-H-I, traced the fate of DHA and EPA after they were ingested,

01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:04.000
 and he found that by the time they reached the bloodstream, they were mostly oxidized and

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:12.960
 breaking down into other substances such as those. And it's those oxidized products that are so

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:23.840
 immunosuppressive, and you can call immunosuppression an anti-inflammatory and

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:35.600
 resolving function. I think it's a dangerous way to resolve inflammation. I think of it as

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:43.120
 sort of analogous to the old treatment of arthritis with radioactive water.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:53.440
 You can knock down inflammation with radiation. They used to treat acne with x-rays.

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:58.560
 - With x-rays? - Yeah, you can temporarily

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:06.320
 reduce inflammation with high PUFA content or oxidized fragments, or you can create the

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:14.320
 oxidized fragments quickly with x-rays. But the long-range effect is that you had a destroyed

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:22.880
 face and head from the x-ray treatment. - So oxidation of the biomolecules,

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:27.600
 it's really, this is where disease began, starts, this is the action?

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:35.840
 - Part of, yeah. It's a suppressive energy-lowering process.

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:41.360
 - So all these poisons and chemicals and anything, this is what one of the chief causes?

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:49.280
 Toxins of oxidative, oxidation? - Yeah, it slows down oxidative

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:58.880
 energy production and we compensate by increasing the glycolytic lactic acid processes that

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:08.640
 shift the whole organism towards degeneration. - The lactic, and that is tied in sometimes to

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:13.600
 myocardial infarctions and heart stuff with too much lactic acid, right?

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:23.920
 - Yeah, it in itself shifts cells in that same direction, so it's a self-promoting

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:31.600
 degenerative factor. - Dr. Cowan, who talks about the

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:38.640
 over-lactation of the heart muscles especially, likes this herb from Brazil,

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.080
 strophanthus. Have you heard about that one? I don't know how to pronounce it properly.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.000
 Do you know that? - No, what was the last one?

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:57.520
 - I'll have to get the proper name of it, but it's a climbing vine out of Brazil that cuts down--

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:00.880
 - Oh, strophanthus? - Yeah, that's it, sorry, I couldn't

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:06.320
 pronounce it. How do you pronounce it? - Strophanthus is the plant and strophanthus

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.600
 is the chemical, but it's also called the same substance, it's called wabane.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:16.720
 - Wabane, yes. - And it's a steroid glycoside that we make.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:24.960
 It's an intrinsic natural adrenal and brain steroid in ourselves, and so the right,

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:35.760
 in aging metabolism, a slight, very, very small supplement of that can be therapeutic.

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.720
 It's similar to digitalis. - Yes, yeah.

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:45.680
 - Digitalis has, for example, some anti-cancer effects, but our natural version of it is

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:51.840
 strophanthus or wabane. - Wabane, yeah. And yeah, he says he said

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:56.720
 he's been using it for many years with no ill effects and just a few drops, you know, maybe,

01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:01.920
 interesting. And doesn't it do something with the pyruvate or in the body? It actually turns

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:08.080
 lactic acid into? - It stimulates our natural oxidative

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:11.600
 healthy processes. - Pretty cool. That's great.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:18.720
 What foods increase carbon dioxide? Sugar? Oranges? - Yeah, orange juice is a great.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:23.040
 - The best one. Such an orange juice guy you are. Do you drink a lot of it?

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:28.240
 - Yeah. - No question there. I just drink a lot of

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:33.200
 oranges. - In Mexico, where sweet oranges are cheap

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:43.200
 and easy to get, as fast as I could get them, I would juice them and always have lots of juice.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:49.120
 - Wow. Does Dr. Peat have an opinion on the blood flow restriction training

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:56.800
 biohack to build muscles, which uses a lactic, oh, I've seen those, which uses lactic bands

01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:01.360
 that you put on your arms. People have always got these contraptions, Doc, that put your arms

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:06.640
 above your biceps or around your legs above the thighs, cuts down the blood flow. And as you

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:13.920
 exercise with those relatively low weights, a lot of reps and several sets, the body responds by

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:20.480
 producing a lot of lactic acid as though you were exercising with massive weights. And so you kind

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.880
 of get the drift of this. What do you think about that?

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:30.800
 - Yeah, injuring the muscle will make it grow, but that's the extent of it. You're still hurting the

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:36.160
 whole organism. - Ah, so what you're doing is you're

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:43.200
 actually damaging the muscle and it might make it bigger, but it's for the whole organism, isn't that

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:47.680
 good? - Yeah. They've looked at the mitochondria

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:56.480
 of old people, which are much less efficient than young people's mitochondria. And then they had

01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:06.720
 them do only concentric exercise, only contraction against resistance, no extension of the muscle

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:17.040
 under force. And with just a few weeks of exercise, they had created new, young-like mitochondria

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:24.480
 in these old people. And it's the eccentric exercise, like walking or running downhill

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:35.200
 or letting a weight down rather than lifting it, extending the muscle, stretching the muscle

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:46.160
 under resistance. That's the eccentric, muscle-damaging kind of activity that causes

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:54.400
 the most muscle growth. So if you want big muscles but not necessarily such good health,

01:19:54.400 --> 01:20:00.880
 you can do eccentric muscle-tearing exercises. - That's tearing, right, when you're doing--

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:06.240
 - Yeah, microscopic tearing damage. - You know, Doc, I've been doing some really

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:12.720
 deep stretching, a lot of it, the last three months, and my legs and body never felt stronger,

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:17.280
 my muscles. And that's just what it's doing, right? If you're stretching, right? If you're

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:23.520
 stretching. - Yeah, it's mostly the activation of the muscle.

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:30.000
 - The activation of the muscle. But there's no resistance to it. I'm just really stretching,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.520
 stretching, stretching. - Yeah, you don't want to force

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:42.640
 elongation of the muscle against resistance. - Right. That would be counterproductive that way.

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:48.560
 - Yeah, yeah. - Here's Dana for Dr. Peat. Dana, she has no

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:56.800
 thyroid. And since a person with no thyroid has to take a full replacement dose, which can be very

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:06.720
 by person, I suppose, what does he see as a probable, the minimum of taking Sinoplus,

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:14.320
 and how to best take it? He has said the body would naturally produce or could use three to

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:20.160
 four milligrams per hour. If you take more than that per hour, is it going to end up in reverse

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:27.040
 T3? It is hard to be on a one-hour schedule with thyroid medication all day, every day.

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:36.240
 - Yeah, you can usually get by taking it with a meal. The meal will delay the absorption,

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:45.440
 so it's more or less natural in the way it's absorbed by the cells a little bit with each meal.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:53.040
 And the overall total amount that you need, animal studies as well as human,

01:21:53.920 --> 01:22:01.760
 show that in a northern climate where you have winter weather and summer weather,

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:08.080
 the requirement for thyroid can be four times as high during the winter.

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:12.640
 - Wow, four times. - I found year after year that

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:26.880
 where I needed only a half a grain of armor thyroid, which would be a fourth of a tablet of

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:36.800
 Sinoplus, I would need two whole grains of armor or one whole tablet of Sinoplus during the winter

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:45.760
 months. Animals pretty much are the same. And so you have to be alert to changing according not

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:56.240
 only to the season but your activity level and diet. When I have to do yard work in warm weather,

01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:05.120
 I stop taking thyroid for a day or so so that I can be more physically active

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:13.840
 and not produce too much heat. - Interesting. Rose has been hypo for over 30 years on synthroid

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:20.320
 the whole time. She says, "I've had numerous medical things happening in my body,

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:27.360
 but I have no idea of who I could contact or get a holistic doctor. Does Ray Peat have any

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:33.920
 ideas of where I can start here? Because I'm confused." - Yeah, Mary Schulman years ago had

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:43.360
 a good international list, but now they don't have the patient comments anymore that helped you

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:52.880
 guide yourself to which doctor you wanted. But if you ask around enough, you might be able to find

01:23:52.880 --> 01:24:03.360
 a doctor who recognizes that women in particular tend to have problems because estrogen interferes

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:15.600
 with the conversion of thyroxine to the active hormone T3. So women always are more dependent on

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:29.200
 the actual preformed T3 and very often get an antithyroid effect from over-accumulating the

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:36.960
 pure thyroxine because the liver is our main source of conversion to the active hormone.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:47.440
 And estrogen, the average woman will have a sluggish liver for the conversion or for

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:55.520
 detoxifying alcohol, for example. So women get drunk more easily usually than men because of the

01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:08.720
 estrogen slowdown of the liver. And if a person is depending on the liver as their main source of T3,

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:16.880
 if they have had a thyroid gland removed, then their liver becomes the main source of T3

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:26.080
 and it just can't do the work. Supplementing selenium or having seafood every week,

01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:37.120
 the selenium allows our peripheral tissues to convert some of the T4 to T3. But if you

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:47.520
 have that problem of not proper reaction to the T4, then you simply need to have a product

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.400
 that supplements some T3. - Gloria says, this is interesting,

01:25:52.400 --> 01:26:00.960
 "My dog has several lipomas and my natural vet suggested it's really a function of the liver.

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:09.360
 I heard Dr. Peat a little while ago talk about liver function and more fructose. What kind of

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:14.080
 fructose could I give my dog?" I mean, yeah, what could you do with your doggies and more liver

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.400
 health? - Dogs like fruit.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.960
 - Do they? - Yeah. We had a cocker spaniel

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:25.840
 when the cherry tree had low-hanging cherries. - So you do?

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.600
 - They would step on their hind leg to graze on the cherries.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.640
 - So would you do like just cut pieces of apple and things like that for your dog and see if they

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:37.200
 like them? - Applesauce, for example.

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:40.160
 - Interesting. - Sort of more digestible.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:44.160
 - Yeah, I never even thought about that. Vince says, "This sounds counterintuitive,

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:49.440
 but please explain how sugar could actually help reverse type 2 diabetes."

01:26:49.440 --> 01:27:03.360
 - Well, I have articles on my website about two doctors in France and England in late 19th century

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:14.000
 who cured type 1 diabetes, the most deadly quick-acting wasting disease, by letting them

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:24.160
 eat all the sugar they craved and within just two or three weeks stopping the stress of inability

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:33.920
 to use glucose by letting them eat huge amounts of sugar, cured them, let their pancreas recover.

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:47.040
 Sugar supports the survival and the formation of pancreatic beta cells. So it has been

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:58.640
 used curatively for type 1. And type 2 diabetes, it's usually the accumulation of large amounts

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:09.440
 of anti-metabolic PUFA in the body. And so if you just try to increase your sugar consumption,

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:18.400
 you're going to be adding calories to a system which is simply metabolically slow. You've got to

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:26.480
 first repair the metabolic process that has accumulated over years, usually with overweight

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:36.240
 of fat tissue that contains a lot of unsaturated fats. Every time you get hungry, you pull

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:44.560
 pre-fatty acids into your bloodstream that turn off your ability to oxidize sugar.

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:52.240
 And so in that kind of diabetes, the problem is to get your metabolism going again.

01:28:53.120 --> 01:29:00.560
 And you can't just correct the problem by flooding the system with more carbohydrate.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:08.160
 Interesting. Mary says she's 70, and she says, "It seems the past few months I get several

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:16.240
 episodes of facial flushing and feeling of heat and can feel my ears turn red." Can Dr. Peat have

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:24.240
 any suggestions of what could be going on? The same as with hot flashes, they can happen to

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:35.760
 men or women, young women. Anytime your metabolism is disturbed, your blood sugar falling,

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:43.920
 just a brief dip in your blood sugar will turn on things like nitric oxide production,

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:54.160
 causing vasodilation. And so experimenters have cured nocturnal hot flushes, night sweats,

01:29:54.160 --> 01:30:05.280
 by having them drink a cup of starch solution or eating a big cup of rice or ice cream or

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:14.480
 some carbohydrate at bedtime. Just keeping your blood sugar up can momentarily stop the

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:23.280
 hot flushes. But the basic problem is getting your energy system efficient, making sure your thyroid

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:30.160
 and vitamin D and calcium intake are adequate.

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:38.320
 Well, you know, Doctor, I've been drinking lots of orange juice, thanks to you and

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:43.120
 my friend, Adam Bergstrom. And sometimes if I do my fasting blood sugar in the morning,

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:50.160
 I mean, it's dead on 80, 85. So, you know, it's not making me blood sugar crazy or anything.

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:54.960
 And there's a lot of sugar in orange juice, isn't there? Yeah, but also potassium.

01:30:54.960 --> 01:31:01.120
 Potassium. So that balances out, right? Yeah, the potassium itself fills in for insulin.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:07.760
 Do you think it's worth it to go ahead and get the organic oranges and juice them yourself or

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:14.080
 get the pasteurized? Do you think it's worth the effort? Any big difference for the body,

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:18.880
 in your opinion? I was trying it for a while, but it was very hard to find

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:27.680
 organic oranges consistently sweet. Sweetness is the overriding thing. You don't want sour

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:33.200
 orange juice every morning. Not good. Not good. But you drink it throughout the day.

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:39.120
 I'm kind of getting the idea. I don't know. Yeah, all day, intermittently.

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:47.760
 But it has to be reasonably sweet. Yeah. And it's hard to find just really good organic orange.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:52.240
 When is the real season for oranges in Florida? Is it in the winter or the summer?

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:58.160
 In a climate like that, I think you have three orange seasons.

01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:06.000
 Do you think there's any concern with the non-organic oranges of taking up

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:17.280
 chemicals, glyphosates and stuff? Oh, sure. But in oranges that you're suspicious of, just

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:27.600
 not only wash them, but don't get around the peeling. But with organic oranges,

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:36.560
 you can make marmalade of the peeling. Well, Doc, thanks so much for being here every month. We just

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:45.120
 really enjoy it. And what's your latest newsletter on? It's going to be on the same subject,

01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:55.440
 the bad adaptive processes that we're exposed to constantly promoting aging,

01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:02.160
 how it relates to inflammation and how to resist the pro-inflammatory forces.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:06.800
 So I guess there could be a good argument. We make it through all this silliness going on in

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:12.800
 the world with whatever. They're all going to be stronger, right? On the other end? We adapt?

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:19.600
 The survivors, yeah. The survivors. Good. Well, I hope you're one of them. We hope you stick around

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:24.080
 as long as you like. So thanks a lot. It's an honor and we love you and your work. And

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:32.960
 it's raypeat.com, his newsletter, raypeat's newsletter at gmail.com. Thanks a lot, sir.

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:42.800
 We'll see you. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Yeah, man. It's great, huh?

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:50.880
 So great we get a chance to talk to all these people. I learned so much.

01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:57.120
 Yeah, folks, if you haven't really had a lot of orange, drink of some orange juice,

01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:03.040
 I don't know about you, but I just love it. I've just been drinking a lot of it.

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:14.080
 Middle of the night, juicing oranges. In the morning, it's really, I don't know. I do really

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:20.480
 well with it. Not sure you will, but it's worth playing around with. And you don't have to juice

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:28.320
 your own. You can get organic pasteurized oranges at the hippie food store. It's fine.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:38.640
 Well, I guess we're just going to go now and we'll see you tomorrow. Dr. Carrie Maddy,

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:46.720
 Maddy, Maddy. And she's a feisty girl. So we're going to talk a lot about what's going on in the

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:54.320
 world of injectable medical devices, what's going on in the world of censorship, medical tyranny,

01:34:54.320 --> 01:35:02.560
 if you will. I don't know how we've even lasted this long, but we still post a few things on

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:09.360
 Faceplant. And we're going to go ahead and stream some more of what Mike Lindell is doing. He

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:21.440
 launched his stream. He's a cool guy. He launched his stream on, what's the name of it? Frank

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:26.960
 speech.com. We ran some this morning and I think we're going to run some more now.

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:32.720
 And you're going to have a chance to get on this Frank stream. And evidently they're going to do

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:38.880
 things like YouTube kind of things and videos and also a social media thing. And there'll be millions

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:52.400
 and he is suing Dominion Software for $1.6 billion. Pretty serious about it. He hired

01:35:52.400 --> 01:36:00.560
 who do you hire? Helen Dershowitz, one of the top

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:10.640
 first amendment free speech attorneys in the world, really. And so, you know, Lindell,

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:18.800
 even though he was, you know, bringing out all this material against Dominion for in support

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:26.720
 of President Trump and this coup d'etat that he believed happened. It's just not going to be

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:31.600
 this some conservative platform and all for the right wing and all that. He wants everybody to

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:40.000
 join. And it's just about free speech and just to have a conversation about ideas. And it's about

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.040
 free speech and not about left or right. And it's going to be great. I think we're going to, all of

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:53.520
 us should move more into embracing everybody that disagrees with the left, right thing. You know,

01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:59.280
 that's a trap. Free speech is what it's about. And that's really what we're up against with the

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:06.400
 Googles and the YouTubes and the face plant and Twitters and Instagram and all those places.

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:15.920
 This is what they're about. It's not about, you know, it's just they have an agenda. And if you

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:22.880
 don't, if you're opposite their agenda, baby, well, they'll just poof you off. So we'll explore it.

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:28.160
 We may get on there and do some stuff. We'll see what it's all about. And I don't see it running

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:35.040
 right now. They may have already hacked them. They hacked them all weekend. But he had about

01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:41.520
 10 million people that were watching this morning. So he's the fellow, you know, the MyPillow guy,

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:49.200
 MyPillow.com, that they sued him. They said that he lied about the material that he put out there.

01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:55.840
 But he said, no, I got proof. It's, you know, Chinese commies, they were just stealing boats

01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:04.480
 and they stole a chameleon of them the night of in November in 2020. So, you know, we'll just stay
