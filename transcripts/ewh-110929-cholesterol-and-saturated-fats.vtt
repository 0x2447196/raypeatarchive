00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.100
 How about free Cuisinart Classic Cutlery or Elite Flatware?

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.700
 That's right! For every $10 you spend, earn a free stamp saver you can redeem for Cuisinart items.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.800
 Once you've collected between 30 and 60 stamps, you can start shopping for a variety of Cuisinart cutlery or flatware,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.700
 available at the in-store display.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.000

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.900
 It's simple. Spend $10, get your free stamp saver, start collecting.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.900
 Safeway. It's just better.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.900
 Block Talk Radio

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:44.900
 You're listening to Holistic Living, brought to you by EastWest Healing and Performance.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.900
 And now, here are your hosts, Josh and Jeanne Rubin.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:59.900
 [Music]

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.900
 What up everyone? This is Josh Rubin from EastWest Healing and Performance.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.900
 Today to host our great radio show with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.900
 Jeanne will not be joining us today, so it's just me and Dr. Ray Peat on the show.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.900
 And once again, you know, I always say this, and not a lot of people call in, but you know, we do this show,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.900
 of course, for ourselves, but we do it more for the listeners,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.900
 because I know a lot of people are really into Ray's philosophy and information.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.900
 So, you know, at the right time, don't call in in two seconds, but at the right time, feel free to call in,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.900
 ask a question. The show's on cholesterol and saturated fats,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.900
 so obviously try to revolve your questions around that.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.900
 The call-in number is 347-426-3546.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.900
 And of course, if you can't listen to the show live, you can always download it later

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.900
 from our actual blog talk radio show page. You can find that on our website,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.900
 eastwesthealing.com, on the right-hand side.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.900
 Or as well, check our Facebook, Twitter, all those fun little social media OCD-creating pages

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.900
 in order to listen to the show later on. Take notes, because it's going to be a great show.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.900
 Of course, I want to just introduce ourselves. If you're new, we own a, you know, a wellness center,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.900
 just probably a wellness center back in the College Bed area, San Diego.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.900
 We work with nutritional lifestyle clients all over the world using phone and Skype

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.900
 to help them with a lot of their metabolic issues, autoimmune diseases, GI problems, and so forth.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.900
 So feel free to call us if you have any questions regarding our services.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.900
 You can check out our website at eastwesthealing.com.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.900
 And if you're local, definitely stop in, check it out.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.900
 One more order of business. I have to check my schedule, but I'm pretty sure it's October 27th,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.900
 which is a Thursday at 2 p.m. I'm going to double-check, but I'm pretty sure that's it.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.900
 We're going to do a show with Dr. Cutler. Dr. Cutler is a biochemist,

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.900
 and he wrote a book called "Amalgam Illness, Diagnose and Treatment,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.900
 What You Can Do Better, and How Your Doctor Can Help."

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.900
 It's a great book. You can look it up. Andrew Hall Cutler, Ph.D.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.900
 It's called "Amalgam Illness." Highly recommend it.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.900
 And our show is going to be on amalgam illness, so definitely stay tuned for that.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.900
 So, today's show, cholesterol and fats. Huge topic.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.900
 Of course, we're going to get Ray Peat's philosophy on this.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.900
 We'll cover lots of things from why cholesterol is so important,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.900
 why a doctor is trying to lower it, why our body needs it, our physiology needs it,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.900
 and what can happen and what it means if it's high or low, and what we can do to actually lower it.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.900
 And it involves why saturated fats, yes, the right types of saturated fats are so important in our diet.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.900
 So, enough of me. I want to get Dr. Ray Peat on the show.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.900
 Maybe let him do an intro of himself this time, because I feel like I never do enough on her.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.900
 Just one more key piece before I click him in. I always say this.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.900
 We do the show. He volunteers his time, and I know a lot of people are emailing him left and right.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.900
 So, please, please, please, I don't care if you send him a check for a dollar, $10, $5, $50, $100,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.900
 whatever you want to send him to say thanks. If you're emailing him, sending him a check.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.900
 You know, I know people that send him checks every month. We send him checks all the time.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.900
 I just think it's important because he's donating, you know, one to two hours of his time plus emails every month.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.900
 So, don't want to say any more of that, but hopefully you can take that and say thank you to Dr. Ray Peat.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.900
 So, let me get him on. Ray, are you there?

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.900
 Yes, hi.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.900
 How's it going?

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.900
 Okay.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.900
 So, I want to know if you wanted to just kind of introduce yourself to a lot of the listeners.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.900
 I always do an intro, and I just feel like it never does you the justice.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.900
 So, I don't know if you want to take a couple minutes just to kind of give a brief history of who you are

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.900
 and kind of where you come from.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:59.900
 Before I studied biology, I was mostly studying language and literature and painting.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.900
 And I had been interested in biology for a very long time,

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:16.900
 but I had a bad impression of academic biology from my high school experience mostly,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:27.900
 but then seeing that in the 1940s there was a very big change in the nature of American biology

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:36.900
 that was powered by industry and government promotion of the gene theory

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.900
 as opposed to the field theory in development and health and so on.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:52.900
 So, I waited a long time until 1968 to actually enter a graduate program in biology.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:04.900
 And I had learned enough about universities and biology to manage to get through the program

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:12.900
 without having too many conflicts with the professors.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:22.900
 Most of the professors were very committed to the genetic determinist idea of what an organism is.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:32.900
 And I was interested in the field concept and the environmental influences on the organism.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:42.900
 And nutrition is one of the most important environmental influences on the nature of the organism.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:52.900
 So, I see our nature as being a matter of potential being realized

00:06:52.900 --> 00:07:07.900
 according to the conditions of the environment rather than the expression of a predetermined genetic program.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:14.900
 So, you're also a writer, guys. If you want to check out Ray's philosophy and what he does,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.900
 definitely check out his website at raypeat.com.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:27.900
 He has umpteen number of articles on his website that are free.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:35.900
 And check them out, download them, buy his books. You can buy his books from his website as well.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.900
 There are a wealth of information. I mean, I think I've read each book six times over easily.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.900
 So, definitely do that. Check them out.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.900
 But that's a synopsis of who Ray is. And today we're going to talk about cholesterol and fats.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.900
 And Ray's done a lot of work on this. He's written a lot on this.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.900
 And I think it's a huge controversial topic out there.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.900
 A lot of people don't understand it. A lot of people are afraid of cholesterol.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.900
 The medical community is making people afraid of cholesterol.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.900
 People don't understand saturated fats.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.900
 So, hopefully today we can clarify a lot of these things or Dr. Peat can clarify a lot of these things

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.900
 to educate yourselves to understand what you're actually saying, the meaning behind what you're saying.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.900
 So, we have a lot of questions here from listeners. I got a lot of questions kind of written up.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:28.900
 But I guess we should start with, you know, kind of some basic questions.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.900
 I mean, kind of on the political side of it or the Western medicine side of it, Ray,

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:40.900
 why do you think America is so afraid of cholesterol and saturated fats?

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:56.900
 I think it's driven primarily by the food industry wanting to sell their products, the seed oils.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:06.900
 The seed oils were already seen to be toxic, cause sterility,

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:15.900
 degeneration of the brain and the gonads and so on, probably from 1925,

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:27.900
 but especially in the 1930s and '40s, the very oxidizable seed oils were known to be toxic.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:39.900
 That was one of the factors in researching vitamin E as something to counteract the toxicity of the seed oils,

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:51.900
 unsaturated fats, as well as the toxicity of estrogen, which happens to interact, synergize with unsaturated fats.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:10:05.900
 And the pig industry had been looking for ways to make their animals gain weight and eat less food.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:17.900
 And George Burr, who's identified as the inventor of the essential fatty acid concept himself,

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:25.900
 discovered that the essential fatty acids slow the metabolic rate tremendously.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:37.900
 Deficient animals eating sugar instead of unsaturated fats had about a 50 percent higher metabolic rate,

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.900
 but various people noticed that effect.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:54.900
 And they found that feeding soy and corn to the pigs because of the unsaturated fats suppressing their metabolic rate

00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:01.900
 increased the profit, less food in, more pig out.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:15.900
 At the same time, they noticed that it was lowering cholesterol, just as one of its biological effects, a toxic effect basically.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:34.900
 And the paint chemists, oil chemists discovered that instead of using the expensive seed oils that were now being sold largely as pig food,

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:43.900
 the chemists discovered how to make paints and plastics from petroleum around 1950.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:52.900
 And that decreased one of the big markets for soybeans in particular.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:59.900
 Henry Ford had imported soybeans to use in the car industry.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:09.900
 He made a car body entirely out of soybean plastic and hoped to replace iron with that.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:17.900
 There's a picture of him using a sledgehammer to pound on one of his cars showing that they were very strong.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:28.900
 But by the late 1930s, only doorknobs and steering wheels were still made of the soybean plastic.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:38.900
 But when the petroleum chemists learned how to use petroleum, that freed up the soybean market for pigs

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.900
 and their production was great enough.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:48.900
 They wanted to find new markets to replace the paint and plastics market.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:13:01.900
 And so they started promoting the health idea of their soy oil, cotton seed oil, safflower seed oil and so on.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:16.900
 And the only biological effect other than sterility and dementia that were established for these seed oils was that they lowered blood cholesterol.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:33.900
 For several decades, people had been noticing that cholesterol accumulated in the walls of blood vessels, atherosclerosis.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:46.900
 And although the first person who discovered that in rabbits had dissolved the cholesterol in unsaturated vegetable oil,

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:55.900
 he realized that cholesterol by itself wasn't causing the disease.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:10.900
 But there had been these experiments that gave a basis for the seed oil people to say cholesterol is found in the hardened arteries and in the blood

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.900
 and their oil lowers the level in the blood.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:30.900
 So they argued by association that if it's in the blood vessel and the blood, then you can lower it in the blood and prevent the disease.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:40.900
 But the very people who had made those discoveries had realized that it wasn't so.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:15:00.900
 And in fact, in the 1930s, people had found that thyroid was enough to prevent the atherosclerosis and at the same time it lowered cholesterol.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:21.900
 Over the last 10 or 15 years, a Swedish doctor named Uffe Ravenskov has gone through the literature and shown just beautifully that there is no connection between atherosclerosis,

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:29.900
 heart disease, and the triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.900
 They are associated, but it isn't causal.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:53.900
 The experiments that had been done in the '30s showed that hypothyroidism and the associated changes caused by the lack of thyroid and metabolism were what caused the atherosclerosis.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:16:06.900
 The cholesterol seems to be there as a defensive reaction to protect the injured blood vessels.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.900
 So just for the listeners, you brought up unsaturated fats.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.900
 Can you just elaborate maybe the difference between the saturated and unsaturated fats for the listeners?

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.900
 Because a lot of people don't really know the difference between those.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:26.900
 It refers to the chain of carbon atoms in the fatty acid.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:32.900
 In one case, they have all of the hydrogen atoms attached to them that's possible.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.900
 So they're saturated with hydrogen.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:49.900
 And if some of the carbon atoms lack the hydrogen, they just have their electron bonds more exposed to the environment.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:57.900
 The absence of the hydrogen makes them more flexible.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:07.900
 Instead of being sort of like a bottle brush bristling with the hydrogen surrounding the chain of carbons,

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:17.900
 it's more like a necklace of beads, flexible where the hydrogens aren't missing.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:27.900
 And the bonds can rotate more freely.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:39.900
 You get two or three or four or five of those double bonds, and the chain is bent at each place there's a double bond.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:58.900
 And at the single bonds, the molecules rotate freely so you can get very flexible shapes when you have the purely or highly unsaturated molecules.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:07.900
 And that flexibility you can see when you put a bottle of oil in the refrigerator.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:17.900
 Coconut oil is hard when it's just a little cool, just below room temperature or even at room temperature.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:23.900
 But olive oil has to be much cooler before it starts solidifying.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:33.900
 That's because it's relatively saturated and canola and corn oil have to be extremely cold before they'll solidify.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.900
 And that's biologically important.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:55.900
 One of its meanings is that if the organism lives at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, for example, and it contained butterfat or olive oil,

00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:03.900
 its fats would be solid and wouldn't be manageable.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:16.900
 For example, if an animal contained 30% fat and it all hardened, its subcutaneous fat would become stiff.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:24.900
 Just the way a steak, when it's in the refrigerator, the fat is stiff.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:30.900
 When it's in very warm conditions, it becomes soft and flexible.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:41.900
 So in the tropics, even fish in the Amazon River, for example, have fat as saturated as butterfat.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:55.900
 And if you grow soybeans or corn in a very warm climate, their fat is saturated according to the temperature.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:05.900
 And chocolate and coconuts grow in a place where the temperature is probably averaging close to 90 degrees.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:16.900
 And so they need to have very saturated fat just for the biochemical manipulation of the molecules to happen.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:30.900
 And if you had unsaturated fats, like is necessary for the cold water polar fish, for them to be flexible,

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:36.900
 they have to have triply or quadruply unsaturated fats.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:46.900
 But if you had those in a fish in the Amazon River, the fish would oxidize its fats in just a couple of days,

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:56.900
 even with a medium unsaturated oil such as soy oil or corn oil.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:08.900
 If you put a rubber hose into a cork in the top of the bottle and put the other end of the hose in a cup of water

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:22.900
 and leave the bottle at room temperature, the water will rise up the tube as the oil is consuming oxygen.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:27.900
 It's just a constant process even at room temperature.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:35.900
 If you raise it to body temperature, 95 or 100 degrees, then the process is much faster

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:41.900
 and you have sticky, rancid oil very quickly.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.900
 So it's a biological adaptation.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:22:01.900
 You can make a pig have subcutaneous unsaturated fat depending on the temperature of the weather that it's exposed to.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:09.900
 If you put a sweater on the pig, it will get more saturated.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:15.900
 It's quite interesting. So guys, what he just said the past couple of minutes, write that down.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:22.900
 That's some really good stuff to educate yourself on the differences and why saturated fat is so important,

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.900
 the right type for humans and why unsaturated fats can be actually quite detrimental.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.900
 Now you're talking about atherosclerosis. It's not the easiest word to say.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:40.900
 Most Western literature, Western medicine literature doctors, they always talk about cholesterol and heart disease.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:46.900
 And if you even read the side of like Lipitor and stuff, it even says this medication has not been approved to prevent heart disease,

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.900
 but they still promote it for that.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.900
 What do you feel, I know your thoughts on intracellular calcium and fibrosis and all that.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:23:02.900
 Can you elaborate on what your thoughts are around atherosclerosis and heart disease and stuff like that?

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:12.900
 Yeah, the polyunsaturated fats that we unavoidably get in our diet,

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:24.900
 they're constantly breaking down, producing free radicals and tending to cause inflammation and tissue injury.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:35.900
 And if anything is disturbing the metabolism of a cell, that's more likely to happen.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:47.900
 For example, the normal healthy oxidation through the mitochondrion keeps the electrons tightly controlled

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:55.900
 while they're being transferred from, say, a glucose molecule to an oxygen molecule.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:07.900
 But if you take away some of the oxygen, the electrons in the mitochondrion will have no place proper to go

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:14.900
 and they will escape as free radical potentiators.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:21.900
 And so the cell becomes more oxidized in the absence of sufficient oxygen.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:33.900
 So any stress of a cell puts out these electrons that can attack the exposed electron bonds in unsaturated fats,

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:39.900
 but the saturated fats aren't open for stray electrons.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:48.900
 So every time you're limited in your delivery of oxygen to a cell,

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:55.900
 you're putting the unsaturated fats in the way of these stray electrons.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:02.900
 And those will then start chain reactions that at the extreme,

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:09.900
 they form lumps of material called age pigment or lipofuscin.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:19.900
 And the free radical oxidized fat fragments attach to proteins

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:32.900
 and they collect bits of iron and other breakdown products from the free radical attacks

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.900
 on whatever is around in the cell.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:46.900
 And these lumps of age pigment, because of their iron and fat fragments,

00:25:46.900 --> 00:26:01.900
 are able to catalyze the consumption of energy and deliver energy from the enzymes to oxygen.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:10.900
 So they can create a false mitochondrial effect, consuming energy and wasting oxygen,

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:22.900
 and then that accelerates the process because the real mitochondrion is further deprived of oxygen by these age pigment lumps.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:29.900
 But before that happens, that tends to be at the end of the life,

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:37.900
 and you get degrees of that happening in which oxygen deprivation and stress

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:45.900
 cause lower degrees of damage and inefficiency.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:54.900
 Signals go out changing the conditions of the organism.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:01.900
 For example, sending signals that more energy is needed,

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:08.900
 activating hormones such as cortisol, estrogen, and growth hormones.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:16.900
 And these three hormones are very closely connected to the rising triglycerides

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:22.900
 and the damage to the blood vessel wall.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.900
 And they tend to interact.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:33.900
 Cortisol increases estrogen, estrogen increases cortisol, and they both increase growth hormone.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:43.900
 And all of these tend to break down triglycerides into free fatty acids,

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:53.900
 which are more reactive, tend to become oxidized more quickly, cause more cellular injury.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:28:03.900
 So the circulating fats in the bloodstream are, in the first place,

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.900
 activated by stress and unsaturated fats,

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:16.900
 and then these three main hormones increase the damage they can do,

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:24.900
 even though they normally would be part of a defensive repair process in the presence of the unsaturated fats.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.900
 They magnify the damage.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:35.900
 So in regards to cholesterol, when an organism is stressed,

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.900
 you mentioned how cholesterol will actually elevate,

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.900
 and I think a lot of people don't understand that.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:47.900
 Why is cholesterol so important for our physiology, and why does it go up when one is stressed?

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:59.900
 The whole stress hormone system, the things that Hans Selye popularized and studied for many years,

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:11.900
 he was concentrating on the steroid system, and that's the most powerful stress-induced system.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:19.900
 The pituitary senses something wrong in the organism, increases its ACTH,

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:28.900
 which drives the adrenal glands in particular to take up cholesterol

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.900
 and to synthesize cholesterol from raw materials,

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:45.900
 and to direct the cholesterol into the mitochondrion to turn it into pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA,

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.900
 and finally cortisol.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:59.900
 Cortisol is the thing which has a short-term defensive reaction against stress.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:07.900
 One of its main effects is to turn protein into sugar

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:17.900
 so that the sugar can be used for energy to increase adaptive ability to handle the stress.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:28.900
 But if you keep your cortisol up too long, you'll destroy too much of your protein tissues.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:42.900
 So before the cortisol stage of stress, the continuously activated adrenal tissue

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:49.900
 will be first producing pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA,

00:30:49.900 --> 00:31:02.900
 and it's only when those aren't enough to handle the stress that the progesterone will be further converted into the cortisol.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:13.900
 So the production of the cholesterol is the first stage of handling a stress reaction,

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:25.900
 and then the cholesterol has to be converted into pregnenolone to further the defensive reactions.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:34.900
 But the increased production of cholesterol itself is a primitive defensive anti-stress system,

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:45.900
 and the later stages, pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA, back up that basic function of cholesterol,

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:51.900
 giving it more dimensions of protection.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:32:01.900
 But starting probably around 1920, people were trying to purify cholesterol

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:06.900
 to see what its biological effects would be.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:13.900
 They found that I think they used about ten different toxins,

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:27.900
 everything from pus from an infection to snake venom, heavy metals, chlorinated solvents,

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:33.900
 everything that occurred to them. They would give a lethal dose of the poison to an animal,

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:45.900
 and if they gave it a good dose of cholesterol, it would survive an otherwise lethal dose.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:55.900
 And that has been done repeatedly. There have been some more specific things.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:07.900
 For example, the testes are stimulated to more efficiently produce sperms in the presence of cholesterol,

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:17.900
 and the cholesterol has a direct activating effect on producing more of the defensive steroids

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:30.900
 and helping the cell do what it should do, as well as interfering with the toxic effects of chemical stresses

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:38.900
 and physical stresses. For example, hyperthermia that will cause your red cells to break down

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:46.900
 if you add enough cholesterol. The cells won't be hurt by an otherwise deadly temperature.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:53.900
 So it's just an incredibly broad spectrum of protective substance.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:34:01.900
 So the list is cholesterol rising under stress as a response, and people should understand that.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.900
 It's your body's natural response to stress to help fight stress.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:12.900
 Now, the issue is with most people, it goes up, keeps going up, keeps going up, and it's never coming down.

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:16.900
 What are your thoughts on that? Is it a conversion issue?

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:20.900
 What do you need to make that conversion from cholesterol to pregnenolone?

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:32.900
 I guess it was about 40 years ago that someone was looking at the effects of varying the amount of cholesterol

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:43.900
 going into either an ovary or an adrenal gland, and they found that if the thyroid hormone

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:49.900
 and the vitamin A nutrition were adequate, the amount of progesterone coming out

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:55.900
 exactly corresponded to the amount of cholesterol going in.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:05.900
 So a very big portion of the cholesterol is being turned into the also protective hormones,

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.900
 pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:17.900
 And that is a massive turnover of the cholesterol that's being produced,

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:23.900
 but it depends on thyroid and vitamin A very largely.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:29.900
 So the higher your thyroid function, the more cholesterol you're consuming.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:37.900
 And in the 1930s, someone noticed that when the thyroid gland had been removed,

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.900
 people's cholesterol immediately went up.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:46.900
 So they would measure the cholesterol and give them a thyroid supplement,

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:52.900
 and immediately as the metabolic rate increased, the cholesterol would decrease.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:36:00.900
 So blood cholesterol was a mirror image of their thyroid function.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:09.900
 But the thyroid also supports the ability to make the cholesterol in the first place,

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:18.900
 but the level that a healthy person maintains depends on everything else that's happening.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:29.900
 If you have, say, a 500 milligram cholesterol blood level, that's considered very high,

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:41.900
 and you can bring it down in a week to 200 or 180 just by giving frequent small doses of a quick-acting thyroid.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:54.900
 And that is protective because it's what's needed for them to produce progesterone and pregnenolone

00:36:54.900 --> 00:37:06.900
 so they don't have to rely on the pure effects of the cholesterol for their antistress activity.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:19.900
 If you lack something needed to turn energy into cholesterol, for example, sugar is needed.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:26.900
 If something is causing you to be overloaded with unsaturated fats,

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:39.900
 and too much starch and unsaturated fats probably are the main reason for not being able to produce enough cholesterol.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:47.900
 The thyroid will also help you overcome some of the blocks to producing cholesterol,

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:55.900
 but a supplement of sugar sometimes is needed to bring up your production of cholesterol

00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:04.900
 so that you don't want your cholesterol to get below something like 160 is the very minimum.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:15.900
 In some studies, after they were seeing that some diseases such as cancer

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:21.900
 were associated with very low cholesterol levels,

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:28.900
 and instead of being that the cholesterol was being consumed by the cancer,

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:38.900
 it turns out that low cholesterol makes you susceptible to developing cancer.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:51.900
 There was a Hungarian study about 45 years ago that found that when they chemically lowered the cholesterol,

00:38:51.900 --> 00:39:01.900
 the mortality increased from all causes, accidents, homicides, suicide, and cancer.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:09.900
 A huge increase in cancer mortality as they chemically lowered the blood cholesterol.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:23.900
 The hormones that aren't being produced from the cholesterol are probably the reason for those increases in mortality.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:28.900
 When it comes to making that conversion, I know a lot of people follow your philosophy,

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.900
 and one thing certain people say is when they start following your philosophy to lower their cholesterol,

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.900
 their cholesterol actually goes up.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.900
 Now is that because of utilizing the tropical fruits that they haven't been used to

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:45.900
 and they're producing more T3 so they're utilizing more and it will eventually come back down,

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.900
 or are they missing something?

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:55.900
 Yes, and no one is really sure what the optimal level of cholesterol is.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:03.900
 For example, looking at old people in rest homes, they followed their cholesterol levels

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:11.900
 and saw that the ones that lived the longest had pretty high cholesterol.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:21.900
 I think the 270 was the number that corresponded to the longest survival.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:34.900
 In the Framingham study, they saw that people over the age of 50 who didn't have at least a 200 cholesterol level

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.900
 were more likely to develop dementia.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:50.900
 In a big study of violence, they divided populations into those with at least 180 cholesterol

00:40:50.900 --> 00:41:08.900
 and those below 180, and the violent offenders were clearly connected with the below 180 cholesterol levels.

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.900
 So going back to the dementia, and I think you mentioned in one of your books,

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.900
 you talk about people with low cholesterol, whatever that number is,

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.900
 there's a higher incidence of depression.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.900
 You talk about cholesterol is precursor to pregnenolone.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:25.900
 Can you elaborate on pregnenolone's effects on our brain chemistry?

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.900
 I know you talk about ACTH on it.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.900
 Can you elaborate on that for the listeners?

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:38.900
 Yes, several signals can tell your brain that you're suffering stress.

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:46.900
 For example, low blood sugar is one of the basic things.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:42:02.900
 The various things that amount to stress act on the stability regulators of brain cells.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:20.900
 GABA is a sleep-inducing peptide fragment of the glutamic acid, amino acid.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.900
 Glutamic acid excites the brain.

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:33.900
 If you take off the acid, it becomes gamma-amino butyric acid, which sedates the brain.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:46.900
 And the stressed brain will activate enzymes to produce GABA and turn off the excitation.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:58.900
 There are specific peptide signals that act parallel with glutamic acid to excite the brain

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:05.900
 and to interfere with GABA, the stabilizer.

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:21.900
 And the valium-type sedative or tranquilizer acts on the GABA-stabilizing system of the brain.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:29.900
 If something is preventing the glutamic acid from being turned into sufficient amounts of GABA,

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:36.900
 valium will fill in and activate the GABA system.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:47.900
 Activating the GABA system turns off the stress signals and stops the pituitary from producing ACTH

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:52.900
 to activate the adrenal cortex.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:44:03.900
 Progesterone and pregnenolone and many other things act on the GABA receptor system.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:14.900
 And pregnenolone happens to be one that doesn't have many other hormone-like effects.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:22.900
 It's basically a stabilizer at all levels of cells in the brain.

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:33.900
 Its effect is on the GABA system to imitate valium to tell your pituitary that the stress is under control

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:37.900
 and to stop producing so much cortisol.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:45.900
 So in early experiments testing the toxicity of pregnenolone,

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:58.900
 someone gave a group of mice or rats 10 grams of powdered pregnenolone made into a slurry

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:01.900
 injected into their stomachs.

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:11.900
 They didn't have any appetite for a few hours because being so full of powdered pregnenolone.

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:21.900
 But the only hormonal effect that they saw was that some of the animals that had been stressed

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:31.900
 and had excessive cortisol or corticosterone before the dose of pregnenolone,

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:35.900
 when they were getting the huge dose, they were normalized.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:43.900
 So the animals were more normal after that big dose than they were before the dose.

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:53.900
 For a person that would be like eating a pound of progesterone all at once, or pregnenolone rather.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:59.900
 So pregnenolone alone, could nutrition philosophies do enough if you're making the conversion

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:04.900
 to raise pregnenolone to help with brain chemistry, skin tone, and overall stress reduction?

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:11.900
 Or do you recommend possibly using a powder of pregnenolone to actually help balance that and lower cholesterol?

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:19.900
 Yeah, it depends on how far the system has deteriorated.

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:29.900
 Many years ago, some Russians found just with isolated mitochondria that giving them pregnenolone

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:39.900
 would structurally restore damaged mitochondria and allow them to begin producing more pregnenolone.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:49.900
 And that's similar to what people saw with isolated progesterone on slices of adrenal gland.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:47:01.900
 When they would give the adrenal slice progesterone, it would increase its production of progesterone.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:09.900
 So in both cases, there's a positive feedback rather than the typical negative feedback.

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:21.900
 You give it some and it makes more, which means that the organism is designed as if it wants as much as it can get.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:31.900
 And ordinarily, you can make enough from converting sugar to cholesterol

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:39.900
 and with thyroid and vitamin A converting cholesterol to the other hormones.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:52.900
 But when you have been poisoned with not enough of the needed foods or too much of the unsaturated oils,

00:47:52.900 --> 00:48:04.900
 heavy metals causing free radical reactions and so on, then it helps to use all of the supports possible,

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:15.900
 thyroid supplements, pregnenolone supplements, possibly DHEA and progesterone, saturated fats, sugar,

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.900
 everything that works in the same direction.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.900
 Right, right. That makes sense.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.900
 Now I'm just going to email from a listener just to rewind it a little bit.

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:28.900
 He wanted to know if you could elaborate a little bit on why growth hormone,

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.900
 when you were talking about it being inflammatory, why is it inflammatory?

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:41.900
 Is it just in itself inflammatory or is it the excess of it actually being inflammatory to the system?

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:50.900
 Most of the research is designed to praise its beneficial effects,

00:48:50.900 --> 00:49:01.900
 but there are some very basic observations that people who have been chronically deficient in it

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:08.900
 have a remarkable absence of atherosclerosis.

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:19.900
 The mice that genetically are deficient in the pituitary hormones have no growth hormone.

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:25.900
 They aren't very big, but they live two or three times as long as normal mice.

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:35.900
 And one researcher removed the pituitaries from several species of animals

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:41.900
 and found that they lived much, much longer than animals with their pituitaries

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:49.900
 if they were given basically a thyroid supplement to keep their metabolism going.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:58.900
 So when you have hypoglycemia, you increase your growth hormone

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:06.900
 and it tends to come with the other pituitary stress responsive hormones.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:12.900
 And all of these tend to have their side effects.

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:18.900
 So they're all beneficial in the right amount at the right time,

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:26.900
 but they're all harmful when they go on too long or too high a level.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:35.900
 People with the giantism acromegaly, for example,

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:40.900
 a tumor or overactivity of the pituitary gland,

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:47.900
 they have an extremely high incidence of atherosclerosis.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:49.900
 So we're talking cholesterol.

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:53.900
 Can you explain just the--you can get as deep as you want, I know,

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:59.900
 but the basics for people and the differences between HDL and LDL?

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:11.900
 Both of them are able to participate in detoxification.

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:21.900
 The protein that helps to carry the cholesterol in the bloodstream itself

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:30.900
 has some very specific antistress, even antiviral activity.

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:34.900
 So they're part of our ability to respond to stress,

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:40.900
 the protein as well as the cholesterol associated with the protein.

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:47.900
 And they're both defensive and both important,

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:55.900
 but the LDL is mostly the one that carries cholesterol

00:51:55.900 --> 00:52:02.900
 into the places where it's needed, the brain, the ovaries,

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:09.900
 testicles, and adrenal glands, but anywhere you're making steroids,

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:11.900
 and that includes the skin.

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:16.900
 Skin is probably our biggest endocrine gland.

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:25.900
 Skin is the next, and then the ovaries, testicles, and adrenals.

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:35.900
 And the HDL has probably some more specific antitoxic effects

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:43.900
 where the LDL is more a delivery system of cholesterol itself.

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:53.900
 And toxins will tend to increase the HDL relative to the LDL.

00:52:53.900 --> 00:53:00.900
 Toxins of most types will increase, both of them defensively,

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:08.900
 but the chlorinated hydrocarbons, radiation, estrogen, and alcohol,

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:14.900
 for example, will increase the HDL relative to the LDL

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:20.900
 because it has some more specific antitoxic effects.

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:25.900
 Now, I know you've talked about before how DHEA can actually lower LDL cholesterol.

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:27.900
 I think I read that in one of your articles.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.900
 Can you elaborate on that a little bit?

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.900
 Can lower which, the LDL?

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:34.900
 Yes, I think it was the LDL.

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:45.900
 Well, anything that is activating the turnover, increasing your metabolism,

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:49.900
 progesterone redirects your metabolism,

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:56.900
 DHEA intensifies some of the cellular turnover processes,

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:01.900
 thyroid is the basic thing increasing the turnover,

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:11.900
 and the turnover of cholesterol, besides making more of the pregnenolone,

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:17.900
 progesterone, it's also important to keep it turning over

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:27.900
 so it doesn't sit around and get oxidized in the presence of the unsaturated fat breakdown product,

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:32.900
 which everyone has exposure to.

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:37.900
 So everything that increases your metabolic rate,

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:44.900
 such as thyroid, DHEA, coconut oil, and sugar and salt,

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:55.900
 all of these things can potentially lower your cholesterol just by increasing its use,

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:58.900
 but it depends on where you're starting.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:05.900
 They can potentially increase it if synthesis is the limiting factor.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.900
 So it's really just going back from cholesterol, the conversion,

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:14.900
 having those things, sugars, T3, vitamin A, to pregnenolone, to reduced DHEA, and so forth.

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:15.900
 Yes.

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:16.900
 Okay.

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:23.900
 Now, I know you've talked about light therapy a lot, and how lack, or just even light.

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:32.900
 Can you talk about how you mentioned how lack of light can actually cause an increase in cholesterol?

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:40.900
 Someone took blood samples every 15 minutes during the night

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:45.900
 and recorded whether the person was awake or not,

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:53.900
 and as soon as the lights went off, the cortisol began rising,

00:55:53.900 --> 00:56:00.900
 and it continued pretty steadily through the night,

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:06.900
 and sleeping decreased the rate of increase of cortisol,

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:17.900
 but it shows that the stress system recognizes very immediately in less than 15 minutes

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:22.900
 that darkness is stress in some way,

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:38.900
 and that seems to be that the intrinsic oxidation free radical production gets out of control

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:44.900
 in proportion to the exposure to darkness.

00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:54.900
 When you measure the cytochrome oxidase, which is what delivers food electrons to oxygen,

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:58.900
 it's the last step in the mitochondrial energy production.

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:04.900
 If you measure that during darkness, it degrades,

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:12.900
 and after several hours, like in the far north, where you have 15-hour nights,

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:19.900
 after about 12-15 hours, the mitochondria swell up,

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:24.900
 some of them explode and leak their contents.

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:34.900
 Just from the 15 hours of darkness is fatal to a large proportion of the mitochondria,

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:39.900
 and first they produce more and more cortisol,

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:45.900
 but finally they're overstressed and simply die.

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:53.900
 So that's part of the aging process, being exposed to the prolonged stress of darkness.

00:57:53.900 --> 00:58:01.900
 When they shined red light on the heads of experimental rats,

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:05.900
 the red light penetrates very easily,

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:12.900
 but it happens that the cytochrome oxidase enzyme contains copper

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:18.900
 in the blue state of copper oxidation,

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:23.900
 and the blue copper absorbs red light,

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:27.900
 and there isn't very much of it,

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:32.900
 so the red light passes very freely through the tissue

00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:35.900
 without being absorbed randomly,

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:41.900
 and so it's delivered to the copper in the oxidative enzyme,

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:47.900
 and it restores the copper to its proper functional role.

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:54.900
 And that's currently what's lost during exposure to darkness.

00:58:54.900 --> 00:59:01.900
 The use of the cytochrome oxidase enzyme, in effect,

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:07.900
 wears it out in the dark and it needs to be recharged by light.

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:18.900
 And you can see similar effects if you expose a bit of tissue to sunlight.

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:24.900
 The blue light and ultraviolet light will excite electrons

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:31.900
 the same way X-rays excite electrons in hard tissue especially.

00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:37.900
 The excited electrons can last for years or decades in the hard tissue,

00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:42.900
 such as the tooth or bone, but in the soft tissue,

00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:51.900
 these excited electrons can be detected in an electron spin resonance machine

00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:55.900
 for hours after being exposed to sunlight.

00:59:55.900 --> 01:00:03.900
 So you can tell the history of a seed or a bit of tissue

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.900
 by measuring the state of its electrons,

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:10.900
 whether it was exposed to blue or ultraviolet light.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:14.900
 But while you're measuring it in the machine

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:20.900
 and expecting it to be able to show excited electrons for hours,

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:28.900
 if you shine just a burst of red light at the tissue while it's in the machine,

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:36.900
 it quenches those excited electrons and they go back to their resting state.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:45.900
 That's apparently what's happening in the rat experiment,

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:50.900
 restoring the copper by absorbing red light

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:56.900
 puts the electrons back in the proper arrangement.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.900
 So you might have said this,

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:01.900
 I just want to kind of repeat and make sure I hear this correctly,

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:05.900
 that it's almost in a simplistic sense that light stimulates cellular respiration,

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:08.900
 progesterone, which is stimulatory to the thyroid,

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:13.900
 which helps with the conversion where darkness is more stimulatory

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:15.900
 towards estrogen, serotonin, those things,

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:19.900
 which are antagonistic to the conversion.

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:20.900
 Yeah.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.900
 Okay, cool.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:27.900
 Guys, don't forget we're taking calls 347-426-3546.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.900
 If you call in, hang tight.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.900
 I'm not going to interrupt Ray when he's talking.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.900
 So if you call in, just be ready to be on hold for a couple of minutes

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:37.900
 and I'll definitely chime you in.

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:40.900
 So don't forget to call 347-426-3546.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:45.900
 Can you talk a little bit about circulating cholesterol

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:52.900
 in correlation with vitamin D and calcium absorption?

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.900
 Is there a correlation?

01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:02.900
 Oh, well, no, not anything I can think of.

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:06.900
 A toxic level of vitamin D is one of the things

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:12.900
 that can injure the blood vessel wall,

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:22.900
 but at physiological levels possibly interacting through parasyroid hormone

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:28.900
 would be an indirect way that they would relate to that.

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:33.900
 I have a question from -- not a caller, someone emailed me the other day.

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.900
 I'm going to read you the question.

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:40.900
 I'm pretty sure it's from an audio/radio show that you were on.

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:43.900
 I don't have a date, but it says his statement,

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:46.900
 which I'm assuming it might be you, so you can correct me if I'm wrong.

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:50.900
 And it states that it is possible to live entirely without eating fats

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.900
 because your body can make all the saturated fat it needs.

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.900
 In the early part of the last century,

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:59.900
 animals that lived on a fat-free diet were completely free of spontaneous cancers

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:01.900
 and lived longer than normal.

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:04.900
 So the question is, the body can make all the saturated fat it needs,

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:09.900
 what's the importance, if any, of consuming saturated fats?

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:15.900
 One thing is that it makes the food a lot pleasanter to eat.

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:22.900
 It makes it digest more efficiently and steadily.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:26.900
 Experiments with a loop of intestine,

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:36.900
 they would put just proteins or just carbohydrates or just fats in at a time,

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:41.900
 and they found that the digestion was very poor

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:46.900
 until you had all three types of food present at the same time.

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:53.900
 And then it was as if the intestine needed a complex stimulus

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:59.900
 before it would really effectively start absorbing and digesting the food.

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:04.900
 So it's partly a stimulus to your intestine

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:10.900
 to handle the protein and carbohydrate effectively.

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:21.900
 And it's a signal of satisfaction that helps to lower stress,

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:28.900
 to have fat and sugar in your food.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:32.900
 So I guess what we should ask, in a homeostatic state,

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:35.900
 which is, I guess, hard to get to for a lot of people,

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:42.900
 can a person, or should they, live on a "fat-free diet"

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.900
 because the body is going to be working efficiently?

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.900
 Or no, I mean, you highly recommend, especially in this day and age,

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:51.900
 people definitely increasing their saturated fat content.

01:04:51.900 --> 01:05:00.900
 Yeah, largely because of the effect on the taste system and the intestine reflexes.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:07.900
 It helps to handle the other foods efficiently

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:14.900
 and to make the whole body recognize that it's being fed properly.

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:22.900
 So it's part of the reflex nervous system that guides eating

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:27.900
 and helps to satisfy the appetite.

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:33.900
 And so people feel more satisfied when they've had fats,

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:35.900
 especially saturated fats.

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:41.900
 And the experiments with the rats,

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:44.900
 they used a purified diet.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:50.900
 And when saturated fats were added,

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:54.900
 they had similar cancer-free results.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:59.900
 It's a very small amount of unsaturated fat

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:06.900
 that is responsible for the stress and cancer production,

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:13.900
 the equivalent of just about a teaspoonful of unsaturated fat per day

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:19.900
 is enough to show a threshold increase in the incidence of cancer.

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:23.900
 And when we eat natural foods,

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:28.900
 we're always getting some of the unsaturated fats.

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:37.900
 And it's hard even eating coconut oil and butter fat and beef fat and so on

01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:42.900
 that they only have about 2% unsaturated fats.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:49.900
 But on a normal diet, it's hard to get down to that threshold

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:53.900
 of about 4 grams of fat per day.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:07:02.900
 And so that's-- besides eating the most saturated type of fat,

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:08.900
 that's one of the arguments for using carbohydrates

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:12.900
 as a major part of your energy supply

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:18.900
 because if we have some extra carbohydrates,

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:22.900
 more than we need to burn at the moment,

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:26.900
 they will turn into saturated fats

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:32.900
 and extend the proportion so that, in effect,

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:36.900
 you can lower the unsaturated proportion

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:41.900
 below the threshold of carcinogenic fats.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:43.900
 Right. That makes sense.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:45.900
 I get some questions on coconut oil and stuff.

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:48.900
 We had a caller. Do you mind taking the caller?

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:51.900
 Okay.

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:55.900
 Caller from the 450. You are on the air.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:57.900
 Yes, hi, Jeff. This is JP.

01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:59.900
 Hey, JP. What's up, buddy?

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:01.900
 No, much you.

01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:02.900
 Hi, Dr. Peat.

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:03.900
 Hi.

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:05.900
 This is Jean-Philippe Roux from Montreal.

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:06.900
 Uh-huh.

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:07.900
 Hi.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:08.900
 Hi.

01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:10.900
 I have a big question for you. You know what?

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:14.900
 I have a best friend of mine.

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:17.900
 Now, I don't know if you can answer me,

01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:21.900
 but it's contracting HEV now,

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:24.900
 and I recommend him some of your recommendations

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.900
 about saturated fats and aspirin,

01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:35.900
 but his last blood test showed that the CD4 and CD8 dropped down.

01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:39.900
 Do you have something to help him?

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:43.900
 What about niacinamide?

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:51.900
 People with HIV often have a very high polyunsaturated fat circulating,

01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:58.900
 and niacinamide is something that will help lower the free fatty acids.

01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:06.900
 If you lower the free fatty acid, the CD4 and CD8 increase again?

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:07.900
 I think so.

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:09.900
 You think so?

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:14.900
 Because you know what? His doctor advised him to begin the tri-therapy,

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:17.900
 like ACT, I think,

01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:24.900
 and I don't know if you advise that or you have other recommendations.

01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:25.900
 I think aspirin--

01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:28.900
 Because I read a lot of it about coconut oil.

01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:35.900
 I tried to explain that coconut oil are very useful when you contract HEV,

01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.900
 and I gave him maybe five tablespoons per day,

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:45.900
 but if the CD4 decreases, I don't know what I explained to him.

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:53.900
 Sugar, niacinamide, and aspirin are all things that help to lower the stress

01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:56.900
 and keep the immune system up.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:02.900
 Okay, but when you said aspirin, it could be 15 aspirin today?

01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:03.900
 Around that.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.900
 Around that.

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:09.900
 Okay, that's very good. If something is going wrong with him, I'll let you an email.

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.900
 Thank you very much, Dr. Peat.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:12.900
 Thanks.

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:13.900
 Thanks, JP.

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:14.900
 Bye, Justin.

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:15.900
 Yes, bye.

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.900
 Bye.

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:19.900
 Great stuff. Great stuff. Thanks, JP.

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:24.900
 Let's talk about coconut oil because people out there, I mean, even our clients,

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.900
 everyone is just so--you say saturated fat, and it's just like, bam,

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:29.900
 people are so against it and they don't know why,

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:33.900
 but we know when we talk about saturated fat, of course, as others,

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:37.900
 you're a huge proponent of coconut oil.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:43.900
 Can you elaborate on why in regards to metabolism, hypothyroidism, the liver,

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.900
 just as much as you can put out there for people?

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:54.900
 Any of the saturated fats have an anti-inflammatory protective effect.

01:10:54.900 --> 01:11:02.900
 A group studying liver disease has found that the fish oils

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:12.900
 and the shorter seed oil unsaturated forms increase liver inflammation

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:19.900
 and a tendency to become fibrotic and cirrhosis,

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:24.900
 and that can be blocked by the saturated fats.

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:33.900
 I think it was an Indian that noticed that alcoholics in India who lived in areas

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:42.900
 where they had ghee or butter as their main fat didn't develop liver cirrhosis

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:47.900
 despite being alcoholic, and they began testing that

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:56.900
 and saw that alcohol activates the unsaturated fats to react with iron

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:01.900
 to break down and produce the liver damage.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:09.900
 And so all of these saturated fats are protective when you have an inflamed situation,

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:13.900
 and that goes all the way up to the waxes,

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:18.900
 such as extracted from beeswax and sugar cane and such,

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:23.900
 the super long chain saturated fats.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:32.900
 And coconut oil is in the medium chain length.

01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:37.900
 It includes some of the very short chain saturated fats,

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:42.900
 mostly it's 14 and 16 carbon chains.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:52.900
 And the shortness of the chain means that it's very mobile in your system,

01:12:52.900 --> 01:13:01.900
 and the shorter saturated fats can be handled in the mitochondria

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:11.900
 without relying on the transport systems for handling 18 chain carbons, for example.

01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:19.900
 The 10 carbon chains can be oxidized as easily as glucose,

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:26.900
 and so instead of interfering with glucose metabolism

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:32.900
 and switching the whole mitochondrial function,

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:39.900
 they can participate and even activate the glucose oxidation,

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:51.900
 and they interfere with the anti-metabolic effects of the unsaturated fats.

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:56.900
 By interfering with the anti-metabolites,

01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:00.900
 they let the mitochondria run at full speed,

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:06.900
 and that works as if you're giving a thyroid supplement.

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:12.900
 The polyunsaturated fats interfere with all of the effects of thyroid

01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:16.900
 all the way from the gland secreting the hormone

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:23.900
 and the proteins transporting thyroid hormone and the cells responding to it.

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.900
 So at all of those points,

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:32.900
 the coconut oil is probably getting in the way of the suppressive effects

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:36.900
 of the polyunsaturated fats, but especially in the mitochondria

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:44.900
 where the coconut oil itself is being very quickly burned and used as energy.

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:46.900
 So the interesting thing for the listeners,

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.900
 I'm going to summarize that if I can,

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:53.900
 is that saturated fats help to protect the body and detox from unsaturated fats.

01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:59.900
 The help with glucose oxidation and kind of reteaching the liver

01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:04.900
 to store glycogen and helping with blood sugar regulation.

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:08.900
 Saturated fats like coconut oil are pro-thyroid and anti-inflammatory.

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:09.900
 Yes.

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:10.900
 Okay.

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:14.900
 Yes, and speeding the metabolic rate,

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:18.900
 that's the most important thing the thyroid does,

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:22.900
 and sugar and coconut oil work right with it

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:28.900
 and maximize the good metabolic oxygen consumption.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.900
 And it's interesting because at least with our clients,

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.900
 there's other things we've done, but to lower people's cholesterol,

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:36.900
 we've actually increased their saturated fat.

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:41.900
 And most people just get completely blindsided by that,

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:43.900
 but it definitely works.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:48.900
 Can you talk about, you've quoted, I think it was Hsieh,

01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:53.900
 in a lot of your articles about coconut oil and its effect on the pancreas.

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:54.900
 Am I correct?

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:58.900
 Can you talk about that a little bit?

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:06.900
 Yes, he was experimenting at the time he was working.

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:14.900
 He was just discovering the multiple factors that regulate blood sugar,

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:22.900
 and he saw that the pituitary would activate the adrenals to increase cortisol

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:24.900
 and raise the blood sugar,

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:31.900
 while the pancreas was making insulin to lower the blood sugar.

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:46.900
 And the coconut oil and sugar worked very similarly to keep the system working

01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:54.900
 to allow insulin both to function and to be produced.

01:16:54.900 --> 01:17:07.900
 And he didn't know at that time there were a lot of things about the interactions of pituitary,

01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:14.900
 sugar, adrenal, and so on that hadn't been discovered yet,

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:23.900
 but working just with those few elements, he was on the right track.

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:25.900
 Good stuff on coconut oil.

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:29.900
 Let's talk about milk, and then I want to talk about eggs,

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:31.900
 because we're talking about saturated fats.

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:33.900
 And we know, or the people that are listening,

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:40.900
 how much of a huge proponent you are of, of course, the right type of milk for that person,

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:44.900
 because of its complete macronutrient and saturated fat.

01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:50.900
 Can you just give us some of your thoughts on why it's so important?

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:52.900
 Why should people be using it in their diet?

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.900
 Because most people out there, nutritionists, are actually not promoting it

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:58.900
 and saying it's actually quite inflammatory,

01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:02.900
 and you actually promote it as something that's anti-inflammatory.

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:12.900
 I think the calcium content, besides it contains such a broad spectrum of all of the nutrients,

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:22.900
 but the disproportion of calcium is, I think, what makes it anti-inflammatory.

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:26.900
 And there are lots of ways that the calcium is working.

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:39.900
 One is that it increases the oxygen-using ability of the mitochondria the same way thyroid does.

01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:48.900
 It specifically activates some enzymes, the uncoupling proteins in the mitochondria,

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:53.900
 that turn on a higher metabolic rate.

01:18:53.900 --> 01:19:02.900
 But systemically, it's suppressing the parathyroid hormone,

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:10.900
 and parathyroid hormone is another of the short-range protective adaptive hormones

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:16.900
 that when it continues too long becomes counterproductive

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:21.900
 and contributes to degenerative diseases.

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:31.900
 People on kidney dialysis tend to get very high parathyroid hormone

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:36.900
 because of an imbalance of phosphorus and calcium,

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:42.900
 and the parathyroid hormone is what eventually tends to kill them,

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:50.900
 causing all kinds of stress reactions, aging reactions to be intensified.

01:19:50.900 --> 01:20:01.900
 And having a chronically high calcium intake gives you a chronically low parathyroid level,

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:07.900
 so the parathyroid isn't taking calcium out of your bones

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:13.900
 and tending to put it into your arteries and kidneys and so on.

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:20.900
 Keeping the parathyroid hormone down protects your arteries and kidneys and bones

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:35.900
 and allows your insulin to do what it should to keep the pre-fatty acids under control.

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:49.900
 The whole system tends to function in a smoother way when you keep these stress hormones minimal.

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:54.900
 So the calcium down-regulates parathyroid hormone, which down-regulates inflammation.

01:20:54.900 --> 01:21:00.900
 So you talk about how the dairy in itself is actually prothyroid,

01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:05.900
 which can help with the conversion of cholesterol. Is that because of the progesterone in it?

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:09.900
 That's just one minor factor.

01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:18.900
 Human milk at least contains enough progesterone and thyroid to meet the baby's needs.

01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:24.900
 So the babies that are born without a thyroid gland, if they're being breastfed,

01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:31.900
 will not have any hypothyroid symptoms until they're weaned.

01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:39.900
 So human milk has a full supportive endocrine system in it for the baby.

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:45.900
 And cow's milk isn't as appropriate for human use,

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:57.900
 but it still has some of the metabolism-supporting hormones as well as the nutrients.

01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:02.900
 Guys, don't forget we're taking callers. 347-426-3546.

01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:08.900
 You're welcome to call in. Ray's taking callers today, so definitely feel free to call in.

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:10.900
 Let's talk about eggs and fat.

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:16.900
 Can you elaborate on why you feel eggs are an important staple of people's diets?

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:19.900
 I know Dr. Brewer talked about that as well.

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:22.900
 Is it the fat content? Is it the protein? Is it the combination of both?

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.900
 Or is there something else in the egg?

01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:31.900
 With the industrialization of the egg industry 40 years ago or so,

01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:40.900
 the cholesterol content of eggs went down quite a bit and the polyunsaturated content went up.

01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:49.900
 So if you can get non-industrial eggs from chickens that have pastures

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:56.900
 and can eat varied food, the eggs are going to be a lot better.

01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:05.900
 But the cholesterol in the egg seems to be one of its important nutritional values,

01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:16.900
 something like 600 milligrams of cholesterol in your diet from some of the experiments.

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:26.900
 It increases the oxidative stability of your lipid particles in your bloodstream,

01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:32.900
 makes them less atherogenic.

01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:36.900
 We've got a caller on the take, if you don't mind.

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:39.900
 Just popped in. He's been waiting for a little bit, actually.

01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:41.900
 Caller from the 949, you're on the air.

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:45.900
 Hi, this is Danny Roddy. Hi, Josh. Hi, Dr. Peat. Hi.

01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.900
 What up, Danny?

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:53.900
 Yo, I just wanted to ask Dr. Peat, I know he's talked about this a lot in his articles,

01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:58.900
 but basically a lot of people in the paleosphere are under the impression that

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.900
 free fatty acids in blood is a good thing.

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:05.900
 So I was curious if Dr. Peat could elaborate on that

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:13.900
 and perhaps explain how that can be harming to the liver and the thyroid.

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:16.900
 What was the material in the blood?

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:19.900
 Free fatty acids.

01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:24.900
 Free fatty acids? Yeah. Correct.

01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:32.900
 Can you explain why somebody would not want that to happen, i.e., like a low-carb diet?

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.900
 Would not want which to happen?

01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:40.900
 He's saying that a group of people that follow the paleo diet out there,

01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:44.900
 it's a high-protein, low-carb diet, and they're saying through their research

01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:49.900
 that having higher levels of free fatty acids in the blood is actually beneficial,

01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:54.900
 and you're saying it's not. So he was asking you to kind of elaborate on that.

01:24:54.900 --> 01:25:04.900
 Yeah, that's my main argument against eating a high-meat diet.

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.900
 That's one of the important functions of sugar, I think,

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:18.900
 because my next newsletter in four months, I think, will be talking about free fatty acids.

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:27.900
 But basically they're one of the means by which stress causes its damage.

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:33.900
 I've known people who were eating two or three pounds of meat a day

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:42.900
 and who were getting sicker and sicker as their free fatty acids and free amino acids increased.

01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:52.900
 And that started me reading more about the free state of fatty acids in the blood.

01:25:52.900 --> 01:26:02.900
 And just about everything that goes wrong involves free fatty acid increase.

01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:12.900
 If they're totally saturated fatty acids, such as from coconut oil and butter,

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:22.900
 those are less harmful, but they still tend to shift the mitochondrial cellular metabolism

01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:37.900
 away from using glucose and fructose and turning on various stress-related things

01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:46.900
 by lowering the carbon dioxide production, I think, is the main mechanism.

01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:52.900
 Amazing. Thank you so much, Dr. Peat, and thank you, Josh. I love the show. Thank you.

01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:54.900
 Cool, man. Thanks for calling in.

01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:56.900
 Take care, guys. Bye.

01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:57.900
 Bye.

01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:59.900
 Do you mind taking another caller?

01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:00.900
 No, fine.

01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:03.900
 Okay.

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:07.900
 Uh, let's see. Caller from the 314, you're on the air.

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:11.900
 Oh, maybe not. Hold on. Maybe they hung up.

01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:15.900
 Caller from the 314, you're on the air.

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:17.900
 Is it me?

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:20.900
 If you're 314, that would be you.

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:25.900
 Okay. Well, I knew that there may be more than one caller from my particular area.

01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:32.900
 I just called in because I had a spare minute and I was hoping to catch some information,

01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:37.900
 so I wasn't really trying to--I didn't intentionally, like, put a question out there.

01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:39.900
 I mean, I'm just--

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:41.900
 Oh, you just want to listen?

01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:43.900
 Yeah, yeah. I'm just now being introduced to most of the stuff,

01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:48.900
 so pretty much anything that's discussed I'll be thoroughly interested in,

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:52.900
 in particular with regard to mitochondrial function

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:59.900
 and how specific macronutrients and even different vitamins and minerals may play a role in how.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:00.900
 So that--

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:03.900
 All right. I'll ask him that.

01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:05.900
 Okay.

01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:08.900
 All right.

01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.900
 Whoa. That was a little too loud for me,

01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:16.900
 but I think his question was--I'll simplify it because I heard a dog, a baby, and a car.

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:21.900
 What does cholesterol have to do with mitochondrial respiration?

01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:29.900
 Oh, first of all, it stabilizes it, protects it against the pre-fatty acids

01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:34.900
 that are one of the disruptive influences.

01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:44.900
 And besides stabilizing it, it actually stimulates respiration, oxygen consumption,

01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:49.900
 which might be just because of that stabilizing effect.

01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:59.900
 But it functions as an antioxidant, partly by the way it interferes with the pre-fatty acids.

01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:13.900
 And cholesterol associates with proteins and nucleic acids as well as other lipid materials.

01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:24.900
 And I think the way it binds to proteins is responsible for its stabilizing effect in the mitochondrion.

01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:32.900
 The proteins that make up the mitochondrion have a very liquid property

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:40.900
 so that you can use an oily solvent, remove all of the oil-soluble materials,

01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:44.900
 and you still have a mitochondrion there.

01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:56.900
 But that shows that the apparent mitochondrial membrane is really a protein structure

01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:59.900
 rather than a fat membrane system.

01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:12.900
 And that protein structure is reinforced and stabilized by binding with cholesterol molecules.

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:19.900
 So in a sense, would you think it obviously just helps with the production of T3,

01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:22.900
 but just the production of carbon dioxide as well?

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:25.900
 Yes, it stimulates the whole respiratory process,

01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:33.900
 which includes conversion of some cholesterol to the hormones as well as producing carbon dioxide.

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:37.900
 Right. Awesome. There you go, Liam. That was for you.

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:44.900
 We've got another caller, I think, from the 415. Let's see if they've got a question for us.

01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:47.900
 It may take a second to get them on here.

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:48.900
 Hello?

01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:51.900
 Caller from the 415, you're on the air.

01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:53.900
 Can you hear me?

01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:54.900
 Yes.

01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:57.900
 Okay. Yes, I was just wondering, a lot of coconut oil,

01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:04.900
 sometimes they make people either feel sick to their stomach at first or really achy.

01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:08.900
 Is that because of the salicylates in it or something?

01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:15.900
 Is it better then to get the refined coconut oil if you're having problems with some of the components in it?

01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:20.900
 Yes, I recommend the completely deodorized kind.

01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:27.900
 The research was always done with the filtered kind that had no odor at all.

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:39.900
 It tastes really good to make ice cream or cookies or something out of the very aromatic kind for safety and general use

01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:47.900
 because some people are allergic to the aromatic, tasty things in the coconut.

01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:51.900
 Making it completely odorless, I think, is safest.

01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:56.900
 Right, but that's not to process, though, the bleach, refine, deodorize, RBD,

01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:57.900
 whatever they call it.

01:31:57.900 --> 01:31:59.900
 You can find ones that are not.

01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:04.900
 They just pass it through diatomaceous earth or full earth,

01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:10.900
 so it's just a filtering process, no chemical treatments.

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:16.900
 Okay, yes, because when we've had the regular virgin coconut oil,

01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:20.900
 I always ended up feeling kind of sick or achy or something like inflammation,

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:24.900
 sort of like with fermented food, so I just didn't know what was going on there.

01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:32.900
 It just takes a spoonful of the very odorous stuff to make me sick for about three days.

01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:42.900
 Okay, and how much a day would be for just an average-weight person to just have however much they want, a few tablespoons?

01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:52.900
 A tablespoon with a meal was enough to make me breathe harder, get pinker,

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:59.900
 have a higher pulse rate and lose about, I guess it was a pound or two a week.

01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:02.900
 Okay, all right, sounds good.

01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:03.900
 Thanks.

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:04.900
 Thank you.

01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:05.900
 I love it, Ray.

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:08.900
 Have a good one.

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:11.900
 Just know to launch along with your answers and just make it so simple.

01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:13.900
 It's great.

01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:17.900
 So could it be, too, because some people aren't used to eating saturated fat,

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:24.900
 and they might have an overburdened liver, biliary insufficiency, and so forth,

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:27.900
 so they increase saturated fat too fast.

01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:33.900
 Could it do with CCK, the release of CCK that causes the nausea, or do you think it's just the actual -- okay.

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:39.900
 Low thyroid people have very touchy gallbladders,

01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:46.900
 and it just takes a little grease to trigger a gallbladder reaction,

01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:51.900
 and you've got to get your gallbladder in good condition.

01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:57.900
 Getting the estrogen down is the basic thing, but low thyroid people,

01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:02.900
 a very high percentage of them have gallbladder disease.

01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:04.900
 Yes, yes.

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:07.900
 I remember reading that in Dr. Jominy's work a long time ago.

01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:13.900
 He found a huge correlation with gallbladder surgeries and estrogen dominance.

01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:18.900
 I got another e-mail from a listener, and he wanted to know --

01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:23.900
 he knows you advocate coconoyl and so forth for their antimicrobial properties,

01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:31.900
 but in addition he'd like to ask about your views on butyric and propionic --

01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:34.900
 I can't even pronounce it.

01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:35.900
 I can spell it for you.

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:36.900
 Propionic.

01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:37.900
 There you go.

01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:39.900
 Acid.

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:46.900
 Those are produced in the intestine by fermenting bacteria,

01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:54.900
 and they have such a protective effect against cancer

01:34:54.900 --> 01:35:03.900
 that people were actually selling butyric acid pills for cancer treatment about 20 years ago.

01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:13.900
 But the stuff smells so bad that some people preferred the cancer to the treatment.

01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:18.900
 They sold tongs to pick up the pills before you swallowed them

01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:22.900
 so you wouldn't have to touch such stinky material.

01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:29.900
 But it is one of the components of milk, butter, coconut oil.

01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:36.900
 The four carbon fatty acids metabolize into that

01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:41.900
 when they're released from the glycerol in the triglyceride.

01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:49.900
 So it's just a trace of it that gives you the buttery smell when you eat butter.

01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:57.900
 Butter gave butyric acid its name.

01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:03.900
 But since it's produced by bacteria

01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:11.900
 and since people with very good health have no bacteria in their small intestine,

01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:17.900
 and the farther up in your intestine that you have bacteria,

01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:24.900
 the likelier you are to have a lot of digestive and other health symptoms.

01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:29.900
 And low thyroid people have slow digestion,

01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:34.900
 and the bacteria tend to occupy most of their intestine.

01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:41.900
 So from the fact that the healthiest people don't have bacteria

01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:46.900
 and the butyric acid is produced by fermenting bacteria,

01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:51.900
 it should be limited to the colon

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:57.900
 and preferably the materials that feed the bacteria

01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:01.900
 should have been digested and absorbed in the small intestine.

01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:10.900
 So I think ideally we shouldn't be making any butyric acid in the intestine.

01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:18.900
 And both butyric acid and propionic acid have some pro-inflammatory effect

01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:21.900
 as well as their anti-cancer effect.

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:28.900
 So even though they are potential cancer therapies,

01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:36.900
 ultimately I'm for minimizing the intestinal production of them.

01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:37.900
 Okay.

01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:40.900
 And aren't they found mostly in the large intestine?

01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:42.900
 Well, no.

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:48.900
 When you have bacteria living up in your ileum, a lot of it's produced there.

01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:50.900
 Okay.

01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:52.900
 Good stuff.

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:55.900
 Now let's get to the question about--

01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:58.900
 we're talking about cholesterol, saturated fat.

01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:00.900
 We've gone through the mechanism of the food,

01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:02.900
 and I kind of want to do a summary at the end,

01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:04.900
 but you have all these people taking statins,

01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:07.900
 and most people don't even know the implications of taking a statin.

01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:09.900
 They don't know what they're putting in their mouth,

01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:11.900
 and they don't know what else to do.

01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:15.900
 First off, what's the risk of not only taking a statin,

01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:19.900
 but what's the risk of lowering your cholesterol?

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:28.900
 Well, the tendency to become violent or suicidally depressed

01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:38.900
 or increasing the tendency towards dementia,

01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:46.900
 making your red blood cells less stable, everything becomes less stable.

01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:56.900
 The cholesterol is an intrinsic part of the chromosome and DNA function

01:38:56.900 --> 01:39:00.900
 and the cell division regulation.

01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:10.900
 The first things people notice would be the emotional effects probably.

01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:18.900
 And the statins, they have some beneficial anti-inflammatory effects,

01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:23.900
 but at the same time, they do lower your cholesterol,

01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:29.900
 and they interfere with that whole chain of syntheses,

01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:39.900
 so they affect your coenzyme Q10 production and anything in that system.

01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:49.900
 And so that probably is a factor in why they cause bones to rot

01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:54.900
 and muscles to break down catastrophically.

01:39:54.900 --> 01:40:00.900
 Muscle pains, cramps and muscle pains, are very common in people

01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:04.900
 who lower their cholesterol very much with the statins,

01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:09.900
 and that can cause what they call a rhabdomyolysis,

01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:14.900
 where the muscle is basically dying.

01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:21.900
 I think it's a similar process that causes what they call fossey jaw.

01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:31.900
 The interference with our cholesterol, it affects everything.

01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:37.900
 Right. Of course, with most people you'd see fatigue, energy issues.

01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:43.900
 And would you see a decrease in libido and hormonal function?

01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:47.900
 Yeah, I think that's one of the early things.

01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:52.900
 Okay. And it's interesting that some of the most common drugs are FSRIs

01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:56.900
 and libido-enhancing drugs as well as cholesterol-lowing drugs,

01:40:56.900 --> 01:41:01.900
 so it's kind of like a little circle going on.

01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:08.900
 So to summarize, what are some foods or what are some things that people can do

01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:13.900
 to help regulate their cholesterol?

01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:16.900
 Up or down?

01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:21.900
 To lower it, because most people complain of high cholesterol.

01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:23.900
 I should say to normalize it.

01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:34.900
 A daily raw carrot will tend to lower your cortisol and estrogen,

01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:41.900
 and that by stopping the stress will let your thyroid work better

01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:44.900
 and increase progesterone,

01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:53.900
 and that should accelerate the conversion of cholesterol into more progesterone

01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:56.900
 and protective things.

01:41:56.900 --> 01:42:05.900
 And avoiding the polyunsaturated fats is essential for your thyroid to recover,

01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:12.900
 and everything that increases your metabolic rate,

01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:18.900
 such as calcium and sodium, are essential.

01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:23.900
 Of course, to get the vitamin A, you could use dairy, liver, eggs.

01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:26.900
 I think you mentioned before vitamin C.

01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:31.900
 What does vitamin C have to do with lowering cholesterol?

01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:41.900
 It's part of the adrenal and ovarian system.

01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:47.900
 I don't think it has a direct synthetic relationship,

01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:52.900
 but it's just part of the adrenal.

01:42:52.900 --> 01:43:00.900
 Probably having an antioxidant function in the cell is exciting.

01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:03.900
 It's like an adaptogen of some sort.

01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:10.900
 Yes, I think it's like a general adaptogen rather than a synthetic catalyst.

01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:12.900
 Okay.

01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:15.900
 Guys, we have about 15 minutes left or so,

01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:19.900
 so definitely feel free to call in if you want to ask one last question.

01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:23.900
 347-426-3546.

01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:26.900
 I don't know if there's anything in regards to cholesterol and saturated fats

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:29.900
 that we might have missed, Ray, that you want to talk about.

01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:30.900
 It's a big topic.

01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:32.900
 We're trying to cover as much as we can.

01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:39.900
 Are there any key points that we might have missed that you feel is important for the listeners?

01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:48.900
 I think the important thing is to not think of the unsaturated fats as anything essential.

01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:53.900
 That has never been proved.

01:43:53.900 --> 01:44:00.900
 What Berg himself proved was that the unsaturated fats lower metabolism

01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:07.900
 so that the so-called deficient animals had a 50% higher metabolic rate.

01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:12.900
 That means that all of your nutritional requirements will increase

01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:18.900
 when you shift to a prothyroid saturated fat diet.

01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:32.900
 And the increased metabolic rate will increase your need for copper and selenium, the B vitamins.

01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:39.900
 And I'm not sure what the effect on protein requirement is.

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:47.900
 The protein can contribute to that same intensifying metabolism effect.

01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:56.900
 So I don't know what the ratio should be between the saturated fats, proteins, and carbohydrates,

01:44:56.900 --> 01:45:02.900
 but it probably varies with the individual's stress level.

01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:11.900
 For example, when you're at rest, your muscles can burn pure fatty acids,

01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:20.900
 but as your level of activity increases, the proportion of glucose oxidation increases,

01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:24.900
 decreasing the use of fats.

01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:34.900
 So your activity level governs the amount of saturated fat or carbohydrate and protein that you need.

01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:35.900
 Right.

01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:39.900
 And for everyone who's listening, we did a show on polyunsaturated fatty acids.

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:42.900
 You can go back to our Blog Talk Radio show page.

01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:45.900
 It's blogtalkradio.com/eastwesthealing.

01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:49.900
 And you can download that show and listen to it.

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:56.900
 He's talking about a lot of above-ground vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, fatty fishes,

01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:59.900
 cod liver, oil, fish oil, all those things are the unsaturated fats,

01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:05.900
 which I know is opposite of what everyone's telling you, so definitely get educated.

01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:07.900
 It's important to know what you're putting in your body

01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:12.900
 and what could possibly be causing the issues that you're having.

01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:13.900
 And you have to make a change.

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:14.900
 Go for it, Ray.

01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:22.900
 You've probably been hearing about the woman doctor who treated her husband's Alzheimer's disease

01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:27.900
 with coconut oil and medium-chain triglycerides.

01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:37.900
 That fits right in with the established evidence that it's the breakdown of the highly polyunsaturated fats

01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:40.900
 that is contributing to the Alzheimer's disease.

01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:45.900
 You can see the chemicals like isoprostanes,

01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:56.900
 the spontaneous oxidation products of the polyunsaturated fats in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

01:46:56.900 --> 01:47:05.900
 So one of the direct effects of the saturated medium-chain triglycerides or coconut oil

01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:18.900
 is to provide the saturated fats to the brain as well as the ketones and the energy supply.

01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:19.900
 Great stuff, Ray.

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:21.900
 Great stuff.

01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:25.900
 I riddled through all my questions, 50-plus questions, checking them off,

01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:28.900
 making sure we got stuff in there.

01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:30.900
 Like I said, we've got about 12 minutes left.

01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:34.900
 If anyone has any questions, one last question they want to ask,

01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:39.900
 definitely feel free to call in, 347-426-3546.

01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:43.900
 Other than that, Ray, anything else you want to add to the show?

01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:45.900
 Nothing occurs to me.

01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:47.900
 Are you selling books again?

01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:48.900
 Yes.

01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:49.900
 Okay.

01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:52.900
 So people can just -- can you tell people how to do that?

01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:55.900
 Because a lot of people email me and ask how to order your books,

01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:58.900
 so I think now's a chance just to let people --

01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:05.900
 Yes, it's on the website, the address, post office box 5764 Eugene 97405.

01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:09.900
 So they just send you a check, let you know what they want with their address,

01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:11.900
 and you'll mail the books to them?

01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:17.900
 Yes, and the postage listed there is $3 for one book,

01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:24.900
 but for a group of more than one book, the postage per book is less.

01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:25.900
 Right.

01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:30.900
 It depends on the number of books and the particular combination.

01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:31.900
 Right.

01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:34.900
 And you're still taking more sign-ups to your newsletter?

01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:36.900
 Oh, sure.

01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:37.900
 Okay.

01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:39.900
 And how much is that for the listeners again?

01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:45.900
 In the U.S., $28; Canada and Mexico, $38; and elsewhere, $48.

01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:46.900
 Right.

01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:47.900
 Well worth it, guys.

01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:48.900
 Well worth it.

01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:49.900
 Unbelievable stuff.

01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:52.900
 Well, Ray, that was an awesome show.

01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:54.900
 I know I speak for the listeners.

01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:58.900
 Once again, not only appreciate you taking the time of your day to do this with us,

01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:03.900
 but appreciate all the research you've done, the open-mindedness that you've had,

01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:06.900
 and everything that you share with everyone all over the world.

01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:09.900
 So really appreciate it.

01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:11.900
 Okay.

01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:12.900
 Have a good one, Ray.

01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:13.900
 Yeah, you too.

01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:14.900
 Thank you.

01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:15.900
 Bye.

01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:16.900
 Bye.

01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:18.900
 So there you go, guys.

01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:20.900
 Another show with Dr. Ray Peat.

01:49:20.900 --> 01:49:23.900
 The guy absolutely amazes me and puts a smile on my face.

01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:29.900
 The stuff that he knows and just how simplistic -- well, to me, how simplistic it sounds.

01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:32.900
 Just remember, everyone's an individual.

01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:36.900
 You have to break that more of the same plus more of the same cycle to change.

01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:40.900
 His information is one way to do that with a huge blast.

01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:44.900
 And just realize that it's not just about eating carrots and taking niacinamide

01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:47.900
 and drinking milk and you're going to be cured.

01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:52.900
 It's all about understanding who you are, what your physiology is, the state that you're in,

01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:57.900
 how many meals you need to eat a day, what are your ratios of macronutrients,

01:49:57.900 --> 01:50:00.900
 what foods are going to work for you, even though they're recommended.

01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:07.900
 So there's so many factors that need to be worked on and fine-tuned and fine-tuned and fine-tuned.

01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:10.900
 So hopefully you enjoyed the show.

01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:16.900
 Like I said, we've got another show coming up October 27th with Dr. Andrew Cutler, biochemist, PhD,

01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:19.900
 on amalgam illness, so definitely get your questions ready.

01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:24.900
 And we'll be scheduling another show with Dr. Ray Peat for maybe October, November,

01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:26.900
 depending on when he's available.

01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:28.900
 Not sure of the topic, but definitely tune in.

01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:31.900
 Check out our Facebook page, Josh Rubin or Gene Rubin.

01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:34.900
 You can go to our website and see our blog.

01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:37.900
 You can find our YouTube page, Facebook, all that stuff.

01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:39.900
 You can follow where the next shows are.

01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:40.900
 Thanks for tuning in, guys.

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:41.900
 I'm out of here.

01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:44.900
 Need one more reason why your Safeway store is just better?

01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:48.900
 How about free Cuisinart Classic Cutlery or Elite Flatware?

01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:49.900
 That's right.

01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:53.900
 For every $10 you spend, earn a free stamp saver you can redeem for Cuisinart items.

01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:56.900
 Once you've collected between 30 and 60 stamps,

01:50:56.900 --> 01:51:01.900
 you can start shopping for a variety of Cuisinart cutlery or flatware, available at the in-store display.

01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:04.900
 Present your items and stamp saver at checkout.

01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:05.900
 It's simple.

01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:08.900
 Spend $10, get your free stamp saver, start collecting.

01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:10.900
 Safeway. It's just better.

01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:11.620
 Better.
