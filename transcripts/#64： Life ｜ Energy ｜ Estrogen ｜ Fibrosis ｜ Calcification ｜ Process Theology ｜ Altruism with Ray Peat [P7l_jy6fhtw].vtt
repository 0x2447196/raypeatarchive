00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 [silence]

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 [music]

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 [silence]

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 [music]

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 How about silently spraying epheromones on top of them and have the local bees chase them?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 One minute. Guys, welcome to the show. Guys, thank you so much for joining us today.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Ray Peat, Georgie Dinkov. Georgie, I interrupted you. Go ahead. What were you going to say?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 No, I was saying instead of a stick, just silently spray them with like, because there's this odorless spray that they sell.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 They're called bee pheromones. And you spray a few like a few sprays on their clothes.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 And basically they will have every domesticated and wild bee and potentially hornets chasing after them no matter where they go.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Just for some context, I was asking Ray what he would do if, you know, if the pressure keeps tightening for vaccination.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 I asked Ray what specifically he would do if somebody knocked at his door and what it would take for him to leave.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 But yeah, I don't know what I feel like we haven't talked, you know, for a little while.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 What you saw, the notion document that I sent you, is there any and we can go in any specific direction here.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 You know, it doesn't matter. Is there any specific topic do you think is critical?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 And, you know, we could fill the first, I don't know, 10, 15 minutes of the show with no nothing special.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 I've still been thinking about the topic for the July newsletter.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 I try to finish my thinking by around the end of the month for a newsletter.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 And it's going to be something related to iron and calcification of tissues, stress and aging.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 And these are themes that I got involved with more than 50 years ago.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 But I see that there are just little glimmers of change and interest in the culture.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 These are, again, timely topics. Age pigment and lipofuscin, for example.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 For sure. I mean, that is something that's become more popular in the last year or two, just in general Internet land.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 But even that's what you wrote about, you've been writing about for decades, you know, the inflammation, swelling, fibrosis, calcification.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 You know, that seems to be incredibly misunderstood, you know, and so I wasn't sure if that was something worth addressing as well.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 And that linked to the old newsletter, which I talked to you and said informed kind of this newest newsletter that you were thinking of.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Yeah, I see that. And I think it was 20 years ago that newsletter was concentrating on the connective tissue response to estrogen and stress.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 And it talked a lot about the collagen surroundings of cells, which is one of the basic harms that stresses and estrogen activate.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 And the people were really doing definitive research in the 30s, 40s and 50s.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 And then that pretty much disappeared because it impinged on industrial profit motives.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 The crude oil industry, the estrogen industry and various branches of the drug and medical industries.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 So what's the typical medical view of fibrosis and how does your view differ?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 I think the reason for all of the differences is that they're thinking in terms of the classical cell chemicals and enzymes enclosed in a barrier membrane and the signals as being reductionist signals.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 So 50 or 60 years ago, someone named Schwartau, I think it was C-H-B-A-P-A was his name,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 found that hypoxia and estrogen created the conditions to produce fibrosis by collagen synthesis.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 And following his perceptions, I've tended to think in terms of global stresses and the functions where the standard medical thing is to think in terms of a concrete signal like an irritant or a pathogen that is creating the irritation and fibrosis.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 And what really shaped my dissertation in 1970 to '72 was seeing that hypoxia, radiation, estrogen and excessive PUFA, all of these things created the same biochemical reactions.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 On the cellular level, it was analogous to Han Selye's general adaptation syndrome on the level of the organism.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Here's the local adaptation syndrome on the level of cells and tissues.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 On a more basic level, can we say that fibrosis is basically the connective tissue equivalent of the lipid pathway for getting rid of excess electrons, unpaired electrons?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 Except it doesn't get rid of them. It's a bad solution. It gets rid of them in the sense of killing off that part of the organism, walling it off, detoxifying it, but cutting it off from function.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 So it's like a dead storage for electrons, basically.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Yeah, separating the area of damage like a lizard throwing off its tail.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 So would fatty acid synthesis precede fibrosis, basically? Would it be like a less suboptimal way of getting rid of these excess electrons?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Oh, yeah, I guess that's a more physiological way. You just blow up with fat instead of calcifying and cut off a part.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Right. So it seems like people gaining weight during middle age, it's a very common process.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 And then fibrosis and deterioration and essentially losing muscle mass and getting saggy tissue and whatnot and skin looking like a cowhide.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 That's basically seems to be the process that happens later on if metabolically things are not recovered.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Yeah, it's doing on the systemic, organic, whole organism level what the local fibrosis does.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 It's preserving the organism at the expense of losing its functional tissue such as muscle, replacing it with fat.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 And exactly the same processes are involved. Intense calcification will cut off an area, turn it to stone.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 And the process of aging is very, very slow turning to stone.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 It involves calcification but in a diffuse way that increases inflammation as it lowers function.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 But the whole organism goes down more or less in a coordinated way rather than calcifying your ears or your pituitary or some particular tissue.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 And the calcium initially gets there with the intent to help because the cells need it as an anti-inflammatory.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 But if the cells are de-energized, then calcium starts to accumulate too much.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 And then I guess under the influence of parathyroid hormone starts to form this, it starts to become part of the fibrotic tissue. Is that correct?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 Yeah, the parathyroid hormone is working by amplifying the de-energized situation that starts it all.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 And something I noticed in the 60s, it turns up over and over in the old microscope literature,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 is that calcium deposits generally involve, when you're staining the tissue, if you use stains for iron,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 you'll see an association of iron with all of these little calcium deposits.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 And that's where it really gets interesting how the whole organism is organized to protect against calcification and excess iron, uncontrolled iron behavior.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 But you get a diffused iron activity along with diffused calcification in a gradual slow aging.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 Or in a local area, you get both of them very intensely involved in essentially killing off and protecting against that damaged tissue.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 What's the signal in the organism that decides between killing off and separating a particular tissue or organ, or turning into a tumor?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 Is there a threshold, or is it more or less a chance event?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Adolf Farberg talked about that.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 He pointed out that there's always a progression from inflammation to fibrosis to calcification.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 And then somewhere along that line, some cells manage to survive in a damaged condition.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 The tumor is a revolt of certain cells in the area that's being isolated and killed off.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Those cells decide to survive.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 And since the organism didn't have the resources to prevent the loss of that calcifying area,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 they are also likely to lack what it is that the escaping cells need.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 And so although they escaped, they don't have the support from the organism to continue functioning as part of the organism.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 So they were just an alternative deterioration, alternative to the calcified tissue.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 So if somebody were to look at a solid tumor localized to an organ and analyze the tissue around it,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 it should more look like concentric circles with the tumor in the center,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 and then a layer around it, maybe calcification, and a layer further out, fibrosis,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 and a layer further out, very inflamed, and a layer further out, be like basically glycolytic metabolism.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 Is that something that's commonly found in tumors?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 One of the common things is that a tumor itself will be turned off by calcification.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 The body will wall it off and not let it go farther.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 So calcification is basically a desperate attempt at walling off a metabolically deranged tissue.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Yeah, and it can do the same with invasive bacteria or parasites.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Is there a situation where this process is adaptive and should not be interfered with?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 In other words, if you're lowering parathyroid hormone, is there a situation where the body says,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 "No, I need that in order to wall that tumor off, and now you just lowered my parathyroid with calcium or like vitamin D,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 so now I cannot get rid of that tumor"?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 I think the better choice is to hope you can provide the energy and the vitamin D,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 and suppress the anti-metabolic parathyroid hormone.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 So this newsletter, obviously you implicate estrogen in the centrality of it all.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 You mentioned also parathyroid hormone.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 What other hormones are coordinating this low energy shift that's getting progressively worse as presumably the inflammation gets worse?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 Prolactin is one of the next involved.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 It involves serotonin and prolactin and aldosterone.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Eventually, growth hormone tends to be brought in as part of the failing tissue.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 So like we talked about last time, the pituitary being roused in proportion to how bad the situation is.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 Yeah, and serotonin generally activates too much pituitary activity.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 And then the pituitary hormones intensify the inflammation.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 First, they create intensified inflammation in the organ.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 They're tuned to like gonadotropins create inflammation and eventually cancer.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 The gonads, TSH, which activates the thyroid, eventually leads to all of these inflammatory hardening,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 fibrotic processes and cancer of the thyroid gland.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 So the pituitary hormones rouse the tissue, but without the resources to function, they lead to the same excitatory damage.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 The prostaglandins and leukotrienes are also intimately involved, right?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 If we consider them hormone-like lipids signaling?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Yeah, and since I don't believe in such a thing as essential fatty acids,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 I see the whole doctrine of the ideology that has built up around the prostaglandins and other prostein,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 the derivatives of arachidonic acid, I think shouldn't be there at all.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 An Australian guy found the series of prostaglandin-like substances that are made from the mead acid,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 omega-9 fatty acids, which we make if we aren't poisoned by external linoleic acid.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 That series of N-3 and N-6 fats, we make basically singly.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 The monounsaturated N-9 fatty acids produce that mead acid series of prostaglandin-like things.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 This Australian, I think his name was Cleland, found that they are without exception,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 that they're anti-inflammatory and constructive for all of the arachidonic acid derivatives end up being harmful.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 I don't want to interrupt you, Gordie. Go ahead.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 Let me see.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 [Laughter]

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 I haven't got it. Go ahead.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 I'm sure you've seen the studies, the older studies that essential fatty acid deficient rats heal their wounds without any scar.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 Wouldn't that implicate PUFA as the cause of the scar formation and the fibrosis and everything else,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 while the serotonin, prolactin, estrogen, etc., they're not innocent bystanders.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 They're certainly contributing, but they're not the primary players here.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 The derivatives of linoleic and arachidonic acid are amplifiers of the little bit of inflammation

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 that should trigger replication and repair.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 If you had only the mead acid derivatives, they would take care of limiting the inflammation response.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 As it is on our present environmental foods, instead the prostaglandins amplify the inflammation

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 and can't derange the healing process and make scar tissue or keloids or cancers.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 Ray, something you're so good at is distilling the hormones down to their basic functions with a naming convention.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 Estrogen, what did you call it, the hormone of new beginnings, or aldosterone, the brittleizing hormone.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 What would you call serotonin, the pseudo-hibernation hormone, and then what would you call prolactin?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 In fish, for example, it's a fluid regulating.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 When a salmon comes from the ocean and confronts the absence of salt in the river water,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 they have a kind of shock reaction, an estrogenic reaction, and put out a burst of prolactin,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 which like parathyroid hormone, dissolves their bones and gives them an immediate old person humpback,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 even though gravity doesn't bend their spine like it does in a human bending over with old age from osteoporosis.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 The fish get an equivalent humpback as their skeletal deterioration is the prolactin,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 which is handling this estrogenic excess of water, is at the same time pulling calcium out of their bones.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 That happens under, for example, estrogen increases our water retention and imitates the condition of a salmon hitting fresh water.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 The shock of that hypotonic condition turns on prolactin.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 In terms of the whole fibrosis calcification, and first being an inflammatory process,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 the prolactin is causing swelling under the direction of estrogen.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 There's that like Striskov paper you quoted in one of your articles that said

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 one of the primary functions was to suppress oxygen consumption and lower the thyroid function.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 It's maybe acting early on in the whole process from inflammation to fibrosis to calcification, or it's during the whole thing?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Yeah, like parathyroid hormone turns off oxidative energy production and shifts over to lactic acid production.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 You get a substitution of protective carbon dioxide, which hardens the bone tissue and keeps soft tissue soft.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Instead, you get lactate, which softens the bone tissue and tends to calcify your arteries and other tissues.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 Are estrogen and prolactin also involved in activating the stem cells in response to tissue injury?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 And then carbon dioxide is supposed to kick in and differentiate them into normal organs,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 but if that doesn't happen, then basically too many stem cells and you get cancer?

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 I think so.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Awesome. And then one thing we didn't touch on was the role of fibrin.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 That seems like it kind of kicks things off and leaks out of the cell and causes havoc to other cells. Is that right?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Is it produced by the liver mostly?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Fibrinogen is produced in the liver.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Normally, there's a constant balance, a whole system of enzymes that produce fibrin and tend to form clots.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 But this fibrin that is constantly being produced from the background of fibrinogen,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 a very thin layer of it is normally deposited on the inside of capillaries,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 giving them a little extra strength, like just a reinforcing film, and on the outside of red blood cells.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 And one of the factors that governs the balance between this constant formation of a small amount of fibrin

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 and the constant breakdown thinning of that layer so it doesn't get too thick,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 one of the main factors governing this balance is estrogen.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 So a high estrogen person gradually gets thicker capillaries, linings, and thicker coating on the red blood cells,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 making oxygen take longer to get out of the red cell and through the capillary into the tissue.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 And probably just about every hormone we have is contributing to that balance.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 Estrogen has been studied as a regulator.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 And just recently, people are starting to see the D-dimer breakdown fraction of fibrin

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 that indicates how much stress there is, or in the case of estrogen,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 it indicates how excessive your estrogen is because you have the enzymes,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 proteolytic enzymes breaking down the coating so it doesn't get too thick.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 And that is seen to be happening in a stress disease or a viral disease like COVID-19.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 And so just checking the blood for the D-dimer is a way of seeing how much stress your system is under.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 So basically it's a biomarker for clotting.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 I didn't hear that.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 It's a biomarker. It's a reliable systemic biomarker for clotting.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 Yeah, and the regulators, several of the regulators of iron, for example,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 high ferritin and high hepsidin, which is sort of a blocker of iron uptake.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 Both the ferritin and the hepsidin levels are increased in COVID,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 and that goes with the defect in the red blood cell iron physiology.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 Did you see the recent study that came out that said vitamin E, specifically alpha-tocopherol,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 drastically inhibits viral repression, specifically for COVID-19, for SARS-CoV-2.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 Just 10 micromole per liter concentration basically obliterated the virus.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 So it's a very interesting study.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 And I'm wondering, since vitamin E also has anti-clotting effect, anti-estrogenic effect,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 potentially even anti-serotonin effect, it may have additional benefits if COVID-19 is mostly a clotting disease.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 Yeah. Have you read the Schutt family's works?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 Evans Schutt was one of the sons, the father and two sons.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 He was working on blocking the anti-fertility effects of estrogen.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 And one of the effects of estrogen was exaggerated clotting of the blood,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 and vitamin E in protecting against all of the effects of estrogen.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 They followed up and showed that it would accelerate the removal of established blood clots

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 and various circulatory diseases and protect the heart from forming new clots.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 And it turns out that estrogen is a basic pro-inflammatory activator.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 Vitamin E as a very essential anti-estrogen factor is also a very fundamental anti-inflammatory agent.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 It works at several levels to prevent prostaglandin toxic effects.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 Does every viral infection involve inflammation in one shape or form?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 I think so.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 So that's why aspirin, vitamin E, progesterone, things like that, aside from any direct antiviral effects,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 they're simply stopping the inflammatory cascade, which is really what eventually kills people if the condition is really severe.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Yeah, basically, we wouldn't be bothered by viruses getting churned out and produced and eliminated.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 It's the inflammation that some of them produce.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 So is it fair to say that, I mean, since we already discussed that maybe the evolutionary purpose of viruses is horizontal gene transfer, more or less,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 then the only reason we get these viral diseases is simply our suboptimal health state, not that the viruses are necessarily trying to kill us.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 Yeah, it's the same with our exosomes, the particles that we make as part of our repair, maintenance and development processes,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 the communication of genetic material and proteins and hormones between cells for regulation and development.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 The viruses are almost identical to our own exosomes.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 They're made by the same machinery, are roughly the same size and structure and so on.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 So when you're in a weakened state where you are susceptible to viruses and get exaggeratedly sick from a cold virus like COVID,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 you're also likely to be having poor reactions to your own exosomes and a sick cell can put out sickness-communicating exosomes.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 So a tumor can produce tumors by sending bad exosomes around the body.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 I think that's a way of thinking of why viruses vary in their harmfulness.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 So as you mentioned before, during stress, cells start shedding their retroviruses into the bloodstream.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 Are these retroviruses just a simple, harmless signaling mechanism or can they actually cause issues?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 You know the main theory that HIV is causing AIDS. It's been disputed many times since it's a retrovirus, right?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 I mean, it's not supposed to be harmful for us.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 Do you think there's any situation where these exosomes, retroviruses released by the cell during stress can cause issues?

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 Yeah, in the case of cancer, for example.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 Cancer cell is a profoundly stressed cell and it sends out crazy alarm signals as exosomes.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 Speaking of coronavirus, I wanted to talk about David E. Martin, Ray, who you've mentioned a few times on your more recent interviews.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 But first, I wanted to talk about your newsletter.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 So the newsletter is available by email now. It's $28, which can be paid through PayPal at raypeetswithansnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 And so we were talking earlier about your new newsletter, which should come out somewhere around the end of August. Is that right?

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 Oh no, I'm hoping to get it written this coming week and quickly mailed, so hopefully before the 10th of August.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 Oh, amazing. Okay. And then same deal with raypeetsnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 And they can email that address to order from PMS to menopause, progesterone and orthomolecular medicine, generative energy, my favorite, mind and tissue or nutrition for women. Is that also correct?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 Right.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 Perfect. And then I wanted to talk about Progest-E from Keenogen.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 You can email Catherine to purchase Progest-E, keenogen@gmail.com.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 And so something, you know, Ray, we talked about, maybe it's 2016.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 I told you that I thought I was contributing to lots of my own problems by taking oral supplements.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 And so since then, I've been much more partial to using topical, like oily substances on my skin.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 So what do you think about using progesterone on your skin if somebody noticed that they had some kind of digestive irritation from it?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 First of all, any vitamin E is, if it's pure, it's very viscous and has an unappealing taste.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 And the viscosity going down your throat in a lot of people will trigger a retching reaction and can irritate just by its viscosity.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 And so one solution is to mix it with butter or put it in your baked potato or whatever that prevents that concentrated oil reaction.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 And that's a problem with lots of supplement people. People take their vitamins or minerals as tablets rather than as blended into their foods.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 So apart from any impurities that are causing allergic reactions, just the fact of a pure chemical hitting your stomach can injure it to some extent.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 But to lower the viscosity of the vitamin E so that it will go in your skin faster, you can add a little bit of olive oil on your skin first and then spread the viscous progesterone onto it.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 And you don't want to mix it in the bottle because the extra olive oil tends to destabilize the solution.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 But mixing it right on your skin, you'll get a much faster absorption.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Somewhere around 10% of it is likely to go into your body.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 So it takes a bigger dose even on top of the accelerating olive oil.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 One woman who had two rigid hands from arthritis, we experimented on her hands rubbing pure progesterone onto the back of one hand and adding some olive oil with progesterone to the other hand.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 And in less than an hour, she could flex and have normal function in the hand that had the olive oil added to the progesterone.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 It accelerates the absorption that fast.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 I have another cool report about Progest-T.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 One of your clients, female clients, who's been buying these bottles for her mom who has dementia, she's in her late 80s, and urinary incontinence.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 And she emails me once in a while asking about why taking progesterone orally irritates her mom's stomach.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 And we discussed several other methods.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 And I suggested that she try a drop in each nostril.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 And apparently that worked tremendously well.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 And her mom is now back and taking care of herself.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 And the urinary incontinence is gone.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 And apparently she can get by just by using a single drop in each nostril, which makes the bottle last for months.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Do you have any qualms or misgivings about nasal administration of Progest-E?

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 With any oil in your nose, you have to be careful with the quantity because if it gets high enough that it can rain down into your lungs, oil in your lungs is something you absolutely want to avoid.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 It's only one drop in each nostril.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 She said that's plenty.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 And it immediately puts her to sleep.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 She sleeps through the night without waking up, without being her pants.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 And apparently now both problems, dementia and incontinence, are gone just by one drop in each nostril.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Ray, can you critique my approach?

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 So for the last few years, I've been taking like an eighth of a teaspoon.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 So that's like, what, 50 milligrams of progesterone and then whatever, how much I've mixed in with DHEA.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 And I'm putting it from my knee to my ankle.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 And I'll put the olive oil on first.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 Do you think that's too much for an average-sized knee to ankle leg?

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 No, but that's about what I use.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 And would you ever use more than one-eighth on one leg?

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Oh, if I have a sore elbow or something, yeah, I'll put maybe a quarter of a teaspoon on it with some olive oil and cover it from shoulder to hand.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 Get as much in as possible, as quickly as possible to get rid of the inflammation.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 In order to improve the absorption, do you think it helps to like thoroughly clean the skin with rubbing alcohol before that?

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 After a bath, it really is good if you can soak your skin so that the top layer of skin comes off.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 And then I know I've asked you before, it might have been on that 2016 Safe Supplements episode,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 but with progesterone, like obviously if you were putting whatever the amount was, whatever teaspoon, half teaspoon or whatever,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 that would be very sticky, right? But that doesn't mean you're wasting it.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 If it's sticky, you would just be using more of it. Is that right?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 Well, if it's noticeably sticky, it's going to go under your clothes and bedding, and it doesn't do any good on your clothes and bedding.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 It ruins them.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 If you rub it thoroughly, you won't see any stickiness or shininess left.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 And that means a good proportion of it is far enough into your skin that it's getting into the blood.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 Okay, interesting. I just do this every day. That's why I'm asking you so many questions about it.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 But you don't need that much olive oil because you couldn't, if you use a lot of olive oil and the progesterone,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 it'd be just like a shiny, slick type of skin, right?

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Yeah, just two or three drops of olive oil for a leg is enough.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 Okay, that's extremely good to know. Do you have any other questions, Roger, or we can move on?

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 Okay, so we have questions. We have some good questions that I thought would be interesting to bounce off of you.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 Did you want to talk about David E. Martin? I thought, you know, what is there to say about all this stuff that's going on that hasn't been said?

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 And watching his videos, I thought were extremely interesting.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 You know, his evidence, his hardcore evidence-based approach with the patents.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Is there anything that needs to be said about his work and what he's found?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 Yeah, some people worry about his credentials and background and the fact that he wears several big rings.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 And he seems to have studied oratory from Bob Hope and Jack Benny.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 When you watch his delivery of profoundly disturbing information, he does a Bob Hope or Jack Benny pause.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 He's extremely effective, but you just have to accept that he isn't a medical professor.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 Well, it seems like he was like a double threat because he understood the law.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 And then, I mean, everything I heard him, I only watched one or two videos of him, but everything he said, he seemed like he understood the science as well.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 Yeah, obviously, it's extremely bright.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 Yeah. And then in one of the, I don't know how to say the guy's name, the Reiner Fulmike,

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 but he, when they were talking in German and then he said he understood what they were saying, I was like, "Oh, this guy's pretty smart."

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 But yeah, and then in one of those videos, he was talking about a quote that Georgie and I talked about last week from Peter Daszak, you know, that, I mean, I know there are a lot of smoking guns in this, but do you know what quote I'm talking about?

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 He says, "We need to increase the public." I mean, that seems really like a smoking gun almost.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 Yeah, if we get the media to hype the pandemic, the investor money will follow.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 Those people, Ralph Berrick, the germ warfare virus designer, has commented on how much money they're going to get from this work.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 So public money is the basic motivator as well as whatever evil germ warfare is involved.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 And then towards the end of that quote, he says, "We need to use the hype to our advantage to get to the real issues."

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 And so, like, the real issues being what Eric Schmidt is talking about and what we talked about a little before we went live, the destruction of the legacy, so-called legacy systems and people's livelihoods and not wanting to compete and playing the empire game.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 Yeah, what Eric Schmidt outlined in detail in 2019 was happening to a considerable extent already in 2020 with many billions of dollars lost by common people, working people and small businesses collapsing all across the country.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 And all of that wealth being concentrated in Amazon and the drug companies, a few billionaires getting huge multiplications of their wealth while the traditional economics of people working and having their businesses was collapsing.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 Exactly what Schmidt said had to be engineered for the US to get ahead of China by developing artificial intelligence to do the work rather than an ordinary human-based economy.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 I have a question about China. I mean, yes, it does some good things for its people, but it seems like their system is not much different at its core. It's still the same thing. It's using people as assets without much care and worry about the individual person or allowing them the freedom to expand and live their lives meaningfully.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 Yeah, they are just better capitalists than their opposition. They're using capital in a fairly arrogant way, but they're helping to eliminate poverty in China, and that will increase the productivity of their population.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 So it's going to be profitable to the people invested in their industry. So it's not at all anti-capitalist. But the good thing about them is that they don't have hundreds of military bases around the world.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 So they can pour these resources, at least for now, into their people until they decide otherwise maybe one day.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 Yeah, but they have a history of several thousand years of not going abroad to enslave people.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 And Ray, I apologize. I know we talked about this before we went live, but it might be worth mentioning just for everyone. So there's a quote. I think it came from an interaction with you with somebody from November 2020.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 And you guys had a few back and forths, and one of them was, "Since RNA vaccines haven't been used before, there's no way of telling in detail, but there's no doubt that general immunity will be seriously damaged.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 Looking at the dismal results of vaccination campaigns so far, I think it could reduce world population by 80 or 90 percent."

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 And so I posted that, and I thought it sounded like some people were saying it might have even been fake. And so is there anything to clarify with that?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 It could reduce the population. It could annihilate every last human being. It could kill off elephants and wombats as well. But we just don't know how deadly it's going to be. It's already killed 18,000 people in Europe, something like 10,000 in the U.S.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 They keep changing the numbers from 6,000 to 12,000 and back to 6,000 at the CDC. Anyway, it's verified that it is killing thousands, but the biology of it indicates that it could keep killing not just the acute first days and weeks and months, but that damaged the immune system.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 It's fairly likely to accelerate all of the inflammatory aging processes, and there are even the mechanisms. For example, the vaccine is known to concentrate in the ovaries, and if it transmits that ability to produce spike protein to the next generation,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 then the weakening of the biology of the offspring could mean that the longevity of that generation is drastically reduced. And so over a period of a few generations, what they're doing now, you can't foresee that it isn't going to kill off the majority of the species.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 Did you see the study about the women who took the vaccine in the first or second trimester had 88, more than 88 percent of spontaneous abortions?

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 No, I didn't see that, but the World Health Organization for years has been advocating giving flu vaccine to pregnant women, and the vaccine has adjuvants intended to create systemic inflammation, and it's firmly established in animals and humans that inflammation during pregnancy causes damage to the fetus,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 all degrees of damage, brain damage and shape of the organs and so on. So what they've been doing in pregnancy is a large scale crime. Now for them to do this experimental treatment on pregnant women is just hard to believe.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 As far as the vaccines, I know the mRNA vaccine can get incorporated into our DNA, and there's even a study that came out demonstrating that it's possible. What about the DNA vector vaccines like AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson? Is the damage, is the risk to them mostly related to the inflammatory state that they cause for a few months while that foreign DNA is in the body?

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 Yeah, what form is their DNA? Is it in a different virus or a constructed virus?

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 I think they're basically taking, I mean, the mRNA vaccine has a synthetic portion of the spike protein, right? Synthetically created. And the DNA vaccines, the vector vaccines, I think they have, again, a synthetic version of a spike protein different from the RNA vaccine, but it's encapsulated into a chimpanzee adenovirus, and that's what they're using it to get it inside of the cell.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 So I know there's horizontal gene transfer, so there's still the potential for this getting to be incorporated in our tissues, but probably less so than the mRNA, right?

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 Well, if the RNA gets into the cell, the same thing can happen to it.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 Okay, so it doesn't matter that it's a vector vaccine, it's still that foreign protein that it carries, that piece of spike protein, it can still get incorporated?

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 Last thing before we move on to questions here, and I feel like you can't state your hypothesis enough, you know, because so many people are getting into your work. But anyways, I posted something from your 1994 Generative Energy book, and it was "More life and more energy can solve many of the basic problems of life."

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 And then I put Albert St. George's quote, it's like an abridged quote, but "The more life does, the more life it is." Dot dot dot. "Life supports life. Function builds structure, and structure produces function." Dot dot dot.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 And I, again, you know, it's the core to a lot of things you're talking about. Is there anything more to say about that that hasn't been said?

00:42:50.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 Yeah, in one of his simple experiments on rabbits, he showed that progesterone allows the heart muscle, and by implication, other smooth muscles, allows the heart muscle to build structure.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 So the function, the more the heart functions, the better the structure is, permitting a more adequate pumping action.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 Seeing a concrete version of what you just quoted from him, that progesterone facilitates that energy and function, builds structure, and structure enables better function.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 I love it. Thanks for that. And then, Georgie, unless you have another question, we'll just move on to these questions that I pulled.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 It's more of a, I mean, it's an article that I saw that came out this week. It's related to Einstein and, I guess, another house of cards collapsing.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 As Ray, you know, Einstein said, he replaced the ether with the space-time continuum, and he said, "We don't need the ether. This space-time continuum can do everything that the ether could do."

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 And basically, it has no properties. And now they just came out with a proof that electromagnetism is a basic property of space-time, which means that, I guess, Einstein was not proven wrong, but that the idea of this abstract, empty space that somehow is devoid of properties,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 and I think that kind of gave the impetus to the development of a lot of abstract reductionist theories in the 20th century, that seems to be now on its way out.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 Yeah, and you know, the Michelson-Morley experiment didn't show a null effect. It showed something like a 20% drag effect of the ether.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 And then, I think it was Morley and Mitchell, I think, did the follow-up work for many years, over and over, doing the original experiment, but in more and more refined ways, in basements and on higher mountains and so on, showing that the earth does drag an ether with it, affecting the velocity of light according to the direction the earth is moving.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 And I think there's one that NASA commissioned in the '80s, which for some reason is not getting much publication. Well, maybe because it confirmed the ether again. It's by a physicist, I think his name is Silverlight. I don't know if you've heard of him.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 But he was a staff NASA physicist, and apparently the guy that they went to when they wanted to debunk really controversial claims, and he confirmed the ether again, and NASA got really angry and said that the reason for his results was abnormal temperature in the room where he was conducting the experiments.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 Yeah, and those follow-ups to the Michelson-Morley experiment, carefully controlled for temperature, because that had been brought out as a defense of the space-time thing. And they absolutely showed that the temperature wasn't involved.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 Ray, have you ever heard that NASA stands for not a space agency? I heard somebody said they say that in the CIA, but whatever. Okay, so here are some questions. Some of these are pretty heavy, and so feel free to talk about as much or as little about any of these as you want.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 Georgie, were you going to say something? No. Okay, I thought you were going to point with your hand. Okay, this one's from Green, and they say, "He has many nutritional, physiological tools to improve metabolism. What kind of personality changes can be made? What is a healthy way to look at the world, or what is an unhealthy way to look at the world?"

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 I think it's important to get pleasure from looking at the world. Intrinsically, the process of being involved and learning from the world gives pleasure. Insight is pleasurable. And the attitude towards the world, that it's a place to be dutiful and do your work, that is a less healthy approach to reality.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 Everything should be more or less spontaneous and fun and intrinsically motivating to continue in that direction.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 I have a question about this. If attitude is largely the result of what the world and the environment allows our health to be, shouldn't we be not forcing a particular attitude? If the environment is crappy and oppressing us, isn't it normal to feel down? Isn't it abnormal to try to force ourselves into positive thinking in such situations?

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 Well, not force, but to find the route to get to the different state where you aren't being oppressed by the world.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 Okay. The reason I'm bringing this up is because I'm sure you've seen when they get these terminally ill patients, they're trying to improve their suffering by doing humor as a therapy. And I always thought, "What a bizarre situation. Here are these people dying from cancer, some of them children, and then there's this clown, literally a clown, in addition to the other clowns in white coats, trying to make them crack a smile."

00:47:46.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 And you can see that they're suffering, they're struggling to smile, and they don't want to be entertained. It's not entertaining, they're in pain. So in situations like that, it's more natural. I don't know. I guess you can find other ways to improve their lives instead of forcing them to be happy. That would be pathological, right?

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 Great stuff. I had another follow-up question that I don't remember what it was.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 Anyways, okay. So this one's from MGAthlete. They say, "Ray has mentioned process theology before. Can you ask to expand on how he has arrived at that and his experience with religion/church in his life?"

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:48.000
 Well, my experience of the world right from the beginning was that it was a process that I was involved in, the nature of my being and the nature of other beings. Everything was obviously an ongoing process in which all of the entities were actually processes, rather than having any fixed points of reference.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 Other than as part of a general picture that you're putting together. And then reading William Blake when I was 18, I saw that his orientation was essentially similar.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 And then Alfred North Whitehead, right around the same time, went into details and he gave that name "process and reality," which that orientation is now called either "process philosophy" or "process theology."

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 And it's in place of all of the theological apparatus. It sees universe as processes at every point.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:57.000
 And that view, is it heretical in a biblical sense? Or is there things that point towards that? How did Griffin arrive at that? How do you still be religious and believe the Bible with that? I'm not saying you do that, but it seems disconnected from the Bible that I'm aware of.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 Yeah, Griffin, he was in a Bible school a couple blocks from the University of Oregon when I was in graduate school there. And he studied his way out of fundamentalism and found his way to that same viewpoint by studying Whitehead.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 And just to be completely clear, when somebody asked you this, you said, "My view is closest to process theology." It wasn't process theology per se, correct?

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 No, I could call it Blakeian consciousness easily.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 Isn't that similar in outlook to phenomenology? Basically that life is a consciousness with interaction with the world around it?

00:50:38.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 Yeah, and it depends on your definition of phenomenology. Husserl himself sketched it out as something that sounded just right to be aware of your awareness and essentially to feel yourself as a process within processes.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 But then Husserl, for some reason, tried to reduce it to platonic reductionism. Very weird.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 He became idealistic. Have you noticed that when your metabolism is at its best, you basically tend to, I don't know if it happens to you, but it happens to be, you tend to suspend judgment in regards to the events that you experience?

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 Yeah, because your thoughts are best when they extend and incorporate a large span of time. Only by suspending judgment can you fill up your consciousness with what it takes to support that perception and understand it.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:48.000
 Love that. Okay, this next question is from Phil Greaves. He says, "What does Ray think of Marx's scientific method and social revolution?"

00:51:48.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 Several Christians and capitalists have said Marx's science was very useful. For example, Nelson Rockefeller said he understood Marx as well as the leftist reporters he was talking to, but he used Marx's ideas to increase his power and wealth.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 That's the nature of a science. Anyone can use it to do what they want to for good or bad purposes.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 But where Marx got his ethical orientation was right out of Christianity. Christian communism and Christian socialism had been going on almost 2,000 years when Marx created a scientific understanding of why society is built the way it is.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 But the way you use that scientific understanding, Rockefeller knew it could be good for him to understand society that way.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 The thing I feel like we will get comments down below. I feel like people are going to say all this stuff is because of Marx. So what would you say to that?

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 All this stuff is what?

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 All this COVID stuff, like making people…

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 The BLM, Black Lives Matter, the riots, everything is driven by Marxist ideology.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 Everything is Marxism and they're imposing it on us. What would your response be to that?

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:37.000
 I don't see any connection at all. You could say it's the Rockefeller world controlling class, the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and World Economic Forum.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 They might understand Marx and use Marx, but Marx had the ethics that you should not kill off billions of people.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 Great stuff. And then have you ever heard that the Club of Rome, like the World Economic Forum is like an extension of Club of Rome? Have you ever heard that before?

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 Extension of what?

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 A Club of Rome, those people that…

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 Oh, Club of Rome. I think the same people were involved, definitely the same class purposes.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 Yeah, nice. I thought that made the old elite history and the new stuff make a little bit more sense when somebody suggested that.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000
 Thanks for that, Ray. Okay, so, and I won't keep you longer. We'll go another 25 minutes or so.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 And I sincerely appreciate it, Ray, coming on here. It's always really special when you do that.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000
 And Georgi Dinkov, my partner in crime, thank you so much. And thank you everybody for listening.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 These are always so fun to do and we have such an amazing audience and you guys all make that possible.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 So sincere appreciation on my part.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:43.000
 Okay, so this next question is from Michael and he says, "How much," he has a bunch of questions, but I picked the, "How much does intuitive thinking coincide with intellectual processing and why does intuition at times seemingly lead us to poor choices?"

00:54:43.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 Well, analysis and reasoning can lead to horrible outcomes. Intuition, the way it's different from simple reasoning, is that instead of starting with postulates and leading to logical conclusions, you're always open.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 When you change your postulates, you have a flexible, open view of the world. That's an extreme, that's the process view of the world where you don't, you aren't committed to a formal, defined set of logical statements.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 And you're constantly refining your hypothesis about the world. So it's open to change or the rational approach to the world.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 You have to get someone to write new algorithms for you and the organism is absolutely not a bunch of algorithms. It's a process that is constantly revising itself.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:08.000
 Do you think one of the reasons for intuition leading sometimes to bad outcomes is because some people live in a world that's been deliberately engineered to disfavor such approach to life?

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 Yeah, it's trying to implant its doctrines and ways of reasoning.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 And Ray, you maintain that, I don't know how to say this, but a pure type of intuition, an animal intuition, is altruistic in nature?

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 Yeah, that's one of the properties of either liberation theology or process theology or Marx's approach to understanding Marxism.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 It's that you have to recognize that there is a reality to good and justice and evil and injustice. The nature of the world is that we are able to appreciate those differences.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 Where the artificial intelligence type of rationalism makes no difference between good and bad, better and worse.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 And not to beat a dead horse here, but that natural altruism or good nature, can that be overridden by lack of basic needs, do you think?

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
 Yeah, by injuring the person or the animal.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 Yeah, you've seen that study with the locust and the grasshopper, right? Where basically they simply injecting a grasshopper with a little bit of serotonin turns them, you know, they're usually they're gregarious, they're playful, they're curious, they're altruistic.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 You inject a little bit of serotonin and then turn into cannibalistic homicidal beasts that devour everything on their path, including each other.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 Thanks for that, you two. Appreciate it. Okay, I skipped over this one accidentally. This Macaroni Delta says, "Is the desire for revenge always serotonergic or can it have a place in a healthy person's psychology?"

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:17.000
 Yeah, I think if you've been slightly injured, you have to process the damage that has been done. And at least mentally, you can think of getting revenge as restoring your wholeness.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:42.000
 It's a mental process of understanding why a person would injure you and incorporating that. You can have thoughts of revenge as part of the process of how to interpret that and go on without actually having to do destructive retaliatory things.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:59:07.000
 There was a study with prisoners of war in Vietnam and they found out that the ones who psychiatrically/psychologically did the best were the ones who fantasized about either escape or getting back at their captors but without acting upon it because the ones that did act upon it either got killed or for some reason, even when they were liberated or managed to escape, they did not do well health-wise.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:17.000
 They ended up with a post-traumatic stress disorder or something else, but the ones that didn't revenge but had vivid imagery of how they're going to pay back to their captors or escape, they seemed to do okay.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:44.000
 Yeah, that kind of mental imagery is part of a healing process, I think, activating your creative ability in a bad situation. It can involve some bad images, but when you do it, you can reconstruct yourself as a constructive, ongoing person with responsibility for improving things.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:57.000
 And it tends to happen when the person is isolated, right? Because normally they will talk to other people and process their trauma through others. But if you're in a prisoner camp, you don't have much opportunity to do that, so you're essentially replacing that with these vivid mental images.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:09.000
 This actually ties in with the process theology, right? Because in your Blake newsletter, you say the desire for vengeance comes with a delusive commitment to the world of memory. Virginity is constantly renewed in the world of the imaginative life.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:16.000
 While Blake said that you can't forgive someone until they stop hurting you, the desire to be forgiven indicates that there's an opportunity to resolve the problem.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:29.000
 Also, I think I detected what you said, if you understand the pathological nature of the person that's hurting you, does that alleviate the frustration of "why are they doing this?"

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:58.000
 Yeah. Once, a cop was extremely unjust, and I thought intensely about that, and what a miserable person he was. But then, in the process of mulling it over for a few hours, I was able to put him in the context and see him as a victim who suffered.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:05.000
 Suffered from various pressures that caused him to become such a miserable thing.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:17.000
 Didn't Mark say that even if you take a serial killer and then you start digging through their life, especially as a child, you'll quickly go from very mad to very sad in regards to their persona?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
 So instead of hating them, you'll be like, "Wow, it makes total sense that a person would act that way."

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:36.000
 Yeah, there are cases where a very bad cop or criminal has got out of that situation and sought forgiveness and realized what he had been doing and changed.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:44.000
 So that's a very Christian ethic, right? As long as you're willing to ask for forgiveness and willing to work to improve your life, then God will grant you forgiveness.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.000
 Yeah, and it's basically a good biological reflex. Healthy biology.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000
 Would you agree with Alice Miller when she says, "Contempt is the weapon of the weak, and defense against one's own despised and unwanted feelings?"

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
 Sounds right.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:08.000
 Yeah? And I think you replied to somebody about the development of these types of authoritarian automatons, and you suggested reading Alice Miller and Wilhelm Reich on how those people develop.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
 Great stuff. Go ahead.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
 No.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:18.000
 I have a related question. The theme of love is a very central theme in Christianity and many religions, if not all of them.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:28.000
 And many people intuitively feel that being in a relationship, in an intensely loving relationship on both sides, is extremely therapeutic and gives tremendous meaning to life.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
 What is the physiological underpinning to that, do you think?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:40.000
 Well, it was already incorporated at the time of Christianity. A few chapters in the Bible talk about that.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:03:02.000
 Reich, in his book "The Murder of Christ," quotes a lot from the Bible and creates a very different orientation from what you hear in a lot of sermons, a very biological, very Christian and ethical approach toward the world.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:15.000
 Right, but when somebody is in love or feels loved and accepted, do you think that the underlying mechanism is basically you're completely stress-free because the world, through this other human being, accepts you for who you are?

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
 You don't need to pretend and do crazy things in order to be accepted.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:33.000
 Yeah, the primitive Christianity was historically, for a couple hundred years, that seemed to be the central theme. Love thy neighbor in a practical way.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
 Great stuff. You know, we won't go too much longer here. I'll let you go very soon, Reich. I sincerely appreciate it.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:47.000
 This one's from Mac, and they say, "Hi, Danny. I would love to hear more about how the mind affects biological processes, processes, however you say that, along the lines of mind and tissue.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:55.000
 I know you have spoken before about how a stimulating life encourages positive biological processes/processes, however you say that."

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:06.000
 You know what I think they're talking about is when you said in "Mind and Tissue," when you go outside to an interesting place and the brain starts consuming tons of glucose and it's very stimulating? That's what reminded me of when I read this.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:19.000
 The way we think about the body and its organs, we've been indoctrinated to think in terms of substance and energy as different things.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:29.000
 Energy is what pushes matter around in space, but it isn't a factual description of matter and energy.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:43.000
 The body we experience is a unitary process, so the organs and tissues and cells and conscious experience are really all one substantial phenomenon.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
 Great stuff.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:05:00.000
 One substance in which energy is moving you as a whole. You don't have to think about the way your life is specifically working on cells and organs.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
 Great stuff.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
 I have a question about routine versus interest in life.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:16.000
 If you're doing something repetitive, wouldn't that give a signal to the cells in the brain that they don't need to produce as much energy through oxidative phosphorylation because it's the same thing every single time?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.000
 Eventually, they're kind of like traveling down their oxidative phosphorylation and may get rid of it altogether if all you're doing is the same thing over and over again.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
 Yeah.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
 You can't really do anything twice.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
 Like Heraclitus said, you're always changing.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:44.000
 If you're trapped in that kind of repetitive behavior, you either have to escape or go to sleep.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:52.000
 People tend to put themselves to sleep rather than escaping from pointless work.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:05.000
 Are you saying that the tendency to doze off and fall asleep when you're doing something boring, that's a normal physiological reaction to escape the energetic stress that this activity is causing?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
 I think so.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
 Okay. That's very interesting.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
 Would it be therapeutic if somebody's stuck at a job?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
 I know the best thing is to leave, right?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:21.000
 But if somebody's stuck at a job that they consider repetitive or routine or generally unfulfilling, would it be therapeutic to remind ourselves of what Heraclitus said?

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
 You may think you're doing the exact same thing, but it's really not.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
 Every moment of your life is different from one second to the other.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
 Yeah. That's the process that should be happening.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
 I have to say, when I worked at Apple Retail, every moment seemed exactly the same, unfortunately, Georgie.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
 I don't know about that.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
 Okay. Awesome.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
 Two more here, and then we'll let you—I think Georgie has a question as well, and then we'll let you go here.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
 Okay, this one's about a tortured dog.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:53.000
 They say, "My dog was brutally tortured before I adopted him." S-R-A, I think it's satanic ritualistic abuse, I believe.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:00.000
 "How can I help him reset this trauma and live a normal life? After two years, he is still unable to relax or play."

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:15.000
 I think lots of personal interaction, perceiving what he's experiencing, and giving him rubdowns and body pleasure, good massages,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:29.000
 rubbing his head and neck and ears a lot while paying close attention, trying to draw out little bits of pleasure that are there.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
 Amazing. Okay, we'll end with this last one. I don't know if you even understand this one.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:40.000
 He says, "What are Ray's thoughts on planes of existence beyond our physical world, such as the etheric and astral planes?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:50.000
 And if possible, how would your definition of energy coincide with this cosmological view?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:58.000
 If pure energy is the primordial essence of creation, is it confined solely to the physical world, or does it emerge elsewhere?"

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:09.000
 I don't think there is any elsewhere. And part of those categories derive from thinking about matter as inert substance.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:19.000
 If you have a very metaphysical idea about what matter is, then you have to have an idea of what animates matter,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:33.000
 and so you get involved in separate energy and planes and so on. But there are all different levels of subtle interactions.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:42.000
 It isn't just the powerful energy that runs through us metabolically to maintain our structure,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:52.000
 but given that complex structure, our sensitivities increase in proportion to how well-structured we are.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:03.000
 And insects and probably dogs, for example, can detect at a distance a single vibrating molecule.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:18.000
 For example, a pheromone molecule can be at a distance and very spread out, but the infrared oscillations emitted by the molecule just sitting there

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:30.000
 are strong enough to be sensed by insects. So the environment is constantly offering us information about itself,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:37.000
 and those levels of subtle energy interactions depend on our sensitivity to them.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:54.000
 And by tuning in, you can find out that our world is full of lots of information and messages that are ignored if you believe in inert matter and separate energy and so on.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:01.000
 Doesn't the idea of having a reality beyond this one ultimately lead to either one of these two paradoxes?

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:08.000
 Either what the Church calls "creatio ex nihilo," which is something was created out of nothing, which to me is absurd,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
 or an infinite regression, which they call "reductio ad absurdum."

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:20.000
 So as soon as you start talking about a world beyond this world, ultimately you'll end up in one of those two, with one of those two explanations.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
 And both of them are, to me, sound absurd, sound senseless.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:33.000
 Yeah, I think that line of reasoning is because we have been taught a certain doctrine about reasoning,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:43.000
 of Rene Descartes' idea of inert matter and consciousness, activating it and so on,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:50.000
 putting dualism or worse into the very definitions that you're working with.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:58.000
 You have to start looking at language as something that you can work with.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.000
 You don't have to accept what people tell you. It is built into reality of language.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:11.000
 So if we had higher rates of metabolism and we paid attention more, we could talk to Aphrodite the cat like you did?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000
 I think everyone is open to that sort of communication.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:29.000
 It's just that the animals are always willing, but people live in their dream world of word consciousness.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:36.000
 Why do you think the second signal system evolved, Ray? I mean, it seems to be a largely pathological development in evolution.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:43.000
 I think it has practicality to make remote things something you can talk about,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:52.000
 rather than having to stay with the surrounding immediate reality that animals and people can talk about.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
 And maybe potentially pass down through the generations, like abstract information?

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
 Yeah, remote in time or space.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000
 Okay. But invariably, if it gets pushed to the extreme, it becomes quickly pathological, right?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
 Too much analytical thought, too much deductionism.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000
 Very easily pathological.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:18.000
 Inferring people from about the age of five or six on participates in flowing mental perceptions.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
 Is there an easy or at least quick way to gauge in a particular society or country,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
 like how much of each system is at play on average in their population?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000
 I mean, some countries have the stereotype of being extremely logical and analytical,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.000
 and others being primitive brutes, which to me is a euphemism for they're probably first signal people.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.000
 Yeah, I tried to do that when I was studying linguistics 60 years ago.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:49.000
 I tried to identify those traits of national identity and language differences.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.000
 So is it something that can be gleaned through from the language that a specific country or group of people uses?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:03.000
 I think so. I think the countries that have lost their grammar to some extent

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:14.000
 have opened up their ability to receive messages in a more realistic and biological way.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.000
 So you're saying cultures with fewer grammatical rules in their language tend to be more open-minded?

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:26.000
 I think so. That was what I was starting my linguistics thesis on.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:34.000
 In the economics world, they're saying that you can measure a country's freedom by the sheer number of laws it has on the books.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:40.000
 Do you think that's a good surrogate too? Basically, the more laws, the less free a country is?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000
 Yeah, that's a reflection of how many laws are built into your language.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:56.000
 You don't have to have a written language, but that helps to turn it into a distracting country.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:07.000
 If you have a language that is more fluid, flexible, that lets you have better perceptions.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
 I'm going to close the show, Georgie. Do you have one more question?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
 No, I'm fine.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:21.000
 Ray Peet's newsletter at gmail.com is available by email now. It's $28 US, which can be paid through PayPal at raypeets@gmail.com.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.000
 You can email the same newsletter to buy all of Ray's books in digital copy.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
 Can they get those in print as well?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
 Some of them are still in print.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.000
 Amazing. Progeste from Keenogen emailed Catherine. She just shipped me 12 bottles. She packages it extremely nicely.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
 Ray, is that film over the progesterone to protect it during the shipping process?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
 Yeah, to keep out maybe even x-rays to some extent.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
 That's what I figured. That's amazing that she does that.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
 Each bottle of Progeste contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.000
 Ray, thank you so much. Stay on the line. We'll chat. We'll let you go. Thank you again.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000
 We have an amazing listenership. Sincerely appreciate these things. These things are so fun to do.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
 Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much for being my partner in crime.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
 And again, thank you, Ray, for all your work and everything you do. Sincerely appreciate it.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
 Have a safe weekend.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
 We'll talk to you guys soon.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:09.000
 OK, peace out, bye.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.260
 Okay. Peace out. Bye.
