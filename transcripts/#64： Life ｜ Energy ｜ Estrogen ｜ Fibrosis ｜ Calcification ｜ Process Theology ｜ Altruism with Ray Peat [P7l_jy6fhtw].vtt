00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.320
 - And, the calcium initially gets there

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.760
 with the intent to help,

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.740
 because the cells need it as an anti-inflammatory,

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.940
 but if the cells are de-energized,

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.080
 then calcium starts to accumulate too much,

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.820
 and then I guess under the influence of parathyroid hormone

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.600
 starts to form this,

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.320
 starts to become part of the fibrotic tissue,

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.640
 is that correct?

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.600
 - Yeah, the parathyroid hormone is working

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:33.220
 by amplifying the de-energized situation,

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.180
 it starts at all.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.480
 Something I noticed in the '60s,

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:43.480
 turns up over and over in the old microscope literature,

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:49.240
 is that calcium deposits generally involve,

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.880
 when you're staining the tissue,

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.640
 if you use stains for iron,

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.740
 you'll see an association of iron

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.760
 with all of these little calcium deposits,

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:06.760
 and that's where it really gets interesting,

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:13.040
 how the whole organism is organized

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:19.040
 to protect against calcification and excess iron,

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:23.120
 uncontrolled iron behavior,

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:28.120
 but you get a diffused iron activity

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.660
 along with diffused calcification,

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:37.180
 in a gradual, slow aging,

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.260
 or in a local area,

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.860
 you get both of them very intensely involved

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.500
 in essentially killing off

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.500
 and protecting against that damaged tissue.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.500
 - What's the signal in the organism

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.980
 that decides between killing off

00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:00.300
 and separating a particular tissue or organ,

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.220
 or turning into a tumor?

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.900
 Is there like a threshold,

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.140
 or is it more or less of a chance event?

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:13.220
 - Adolf Barberg talked about that,

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:18.220
 and he pointed out that there's always a progression

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:23.860
 from inflammation to fibrosis to calcification,

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.980
 and then somewhere along that line,

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:33.980
 some cells manage to survive in a damaged condition,

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:41.900
 that the tumor is a revolt of certain cells

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:49.100
 in the area that's being isolated and killed off.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.580
 Those cells decide to survive,

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:56.580
 and since the organism didn't have the resources

00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:01.820
 to prevent the loss of that calcifying area,

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:06.900
 they are also likely to lack

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.540
 what it is that the escaping cells need,

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.300
 and so although they escaped,

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:18.100
 they don't have the support from the organism

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.740
 to continue functioning as part of the organism.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.620
 So they were just an alternative,

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:31.980
 deterioration alternative to the calcified tissue.

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.420
 - So if somebody were to look at a solid tumor

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:39.060
 localized to an organ and analyzes the tissue around it,

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.620
 it should more like look like concentric circles

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.260
 with the tumor in the center,

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.700
 and then a layer around it,

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:49.620
 maybe a calcification and a layer further out of fibrosis,

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.380
 and a layer further out, very inflamed,

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.900
 and a layer further out,

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.260
 be like basically glycolytic metabolism.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.300
 Is that something that's commonly found in tumors?

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:05.260
 - One of the common things is that a tumor itself

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.540
 will be turned off by calcification.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:14.980
 The body will wall it off and not let it go farther.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:19.420
 - So calcification is basically a desperate attempt

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.580
 at walling off a metabolically deranged tissue.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:27.180
 - Yeah, and it can do the same with invasive bacteria.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.980
 - Okay. - Or parasites.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:33.660
 - Is there a situation where this process is adaptive

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.180
 and should not be interfered with?

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.000
 In other words, if you're lowering parathyroid hormone,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.340
 is there a situation where the body says,

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:42.140
 "No, I need that in order to wall that tumor off,

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.940
 "and now you just lower my parathyroid

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.700
 "with calcium or like vitamin D,

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.700
 "so now I cannot get rid of that tumor."

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:54.700
 - I think the better choice is to hope you can provide

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.940
 the energy and the vitamin D,

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:03.940
 and suppress the anti-metabolic parathyroid hormone.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:10.060
 - So this newsletter, obviously you implicate estrogen

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.900
 in the centrality of it all.

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.900
 What, you mentioned also parathyroid hormone.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:19.900
 What other hormones are coordinating this low energy shift

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.020
 that's getting progressively worse

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.460
 as presumably the inflammation gets worse?

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:29.620
 - Prolactin is one of the next,

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:33.460
 involves serotonin and prolactin,

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.660
 and aldosterone,

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.700
 eventually growth hormone tends to be brought in

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:53.420
 as part of the failing tissue.

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.140
 - So like we talked about last time,

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.060
 the pituitary being roused in proportion

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.460
 to how bad the situation is?

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:06.700
 - Yeah, and serotonin generally activates

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.580
 too much pituitary activity,

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.940
 and then the pituitary hormones

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:20.140
 intensify the inflammation.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:25.140
 First, they create intensified inflammation in the organ.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:31.260
 They're tuned to, like gonadotropins,

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:35.420
 create inflammation and eventually cancer.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:40.420
 The gonads, TSH, which activates the thyroid,

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:47.380
 eventually leads to all of these inflammatory,

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:54.540
 hardening, fibrotic processes,

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.420
 and cancer of the thyroid gland.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:02.380
 So the pituitary hormones rouse the tissue

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.820
 but without the resources to function,

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:10.820
 they lead to the same excitatory damage.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:14.700
 - The prostaglandins and leukotrienes

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.140
 are also intimately involved, right?

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.740
 If we consider them hormone-like lipids signaling?

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.540
 - Yeah, and since I don't believe in such a thing

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.540
 as essential fatty acids,

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:30.460
 I see the whole doctrine of the ideology

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:34.700
 that does build up around the prostaglandins

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.620
 and other prostane,

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:43.780
 the derivatives of arachidonic acid,

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.880
 I think shouldn't be there at all.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:53.300
 An Australian guy found the series of prostaglandin-like

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:01.500
 substances that are made from the mead acid,

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.820
 omega minus nine fatty acids,

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.860
 which we make if we aren't poisoned

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.740
 by external linoleic acid

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:18.740
 and that series of N minus three and N minus six fats.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:25.820
 We make basically the,

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.240
 (stammering)

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.380
 singly,

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:41.180
 the monounsaturated N minus nine fatty acids

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:51.780
 produce that mead acid series of prostaglandin-like things.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.940
 And this Australian, I think his name was Cleland,

00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:00.540
 found that they are, without exception,

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.900
 that they're anti-inflammatory and constructive

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:08.220
 for all of the arachidonic acid derivatives

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.700
 are end up being harmful.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:15.860
 - I don't wanna interrupt you, George, go ahead.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:20.100
 (laughing)

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.980
 - I have a, oh yes, I'm sure you've seen the studies,

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:27.300
 the older studies that essential fatty acid deficient rats

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.220
 heal their wounds without any scar.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.180
 Wouldn't that implicate PUFA as the cause

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.820
 of the scar formation and the fibrosis and everything else

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:38.460
 while the serotonin, prolactin, estrogen, et cetera,

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:39.780
 they're not innocent bystanders,

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.220
 they're certainly contributing,

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:44.300
 but they're not the primary players here.

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:49.300
 - Yeah, the derivatives of linoleic and arachidonic acid

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.820
 are amplifiers of the little bit of inflammation

00:38:55.820 --> 00:39:01.500
 that should trigger replication and repair.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:07.860
 If you had only the mead acid derivatives,

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:12.860
 they would take care of limiting the inflammation response

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:20.700
 and as it is on our present environment,

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:24.980
 environmental foods, instead the prostaglandins

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:29.980
 amplify the inflammation and can derange

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:38.500
 the healing process and make scar tissue

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.100
 or keloids or cancers.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:45.860
 - Ray, something you're so good at is kind of distilling

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.460
 the hormones down to their basic functions

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.740
 with like a naming convention.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.500
 So like estrogen, what did you call it?

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.140
 Like the hormone of new beginnings or aldosterone,

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:59.500
 the brittleizing hormone, what would you call maybe serotonin

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.740
 the pseudo hibernation hormone

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.860
 and then what would you call prolactin?

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:11.340
 - Oh, it's in fish, for example, it's a fluid regulating

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:20.140
 when a salmon comes from the ocean and confronts

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:25.260
 the absence of salt in the river water,

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:31.100
 they have a kind of shock reaction, an estrogenic reaction

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.680
 and put out a burst of prolactin,

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:38.900
 which like parathyroid hormone dissolves their bones,

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:43.900
 gives them an immediate old person,

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:49.100
 humpback, even though gravity doesn't bend their spine

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:52.860
 like it does in a human bending over with old age

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:57.860
 and osteoporosis, the fish get an equivalent humpback

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:03.380
 as their skeletal deterioration is the prolactin,

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:12.820
 which is handling this estrogenic excess of water

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:18.820
 is at the same time pulling calcium out of their bones

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:25.180
 and that happens under, for example,

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:30.860
 estrogen increases our water retention

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:35.860
 and imitates the condition of a salmon hitting freshwater,

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:43.500
 the shock of that hypotonic condition turns on prolactin.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:52.660
 - So in terms of the whole fibrosis calcification

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.460
 and first being inflammatory process,

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.420
 the prolactin is causing swelling

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.420
 under the direction of estrogen

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.580
 and then also there's that like Striskov paper,

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.260
 you quoted in one of your articles that said,

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.700
 one of the primary functions was to like suppress

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.980
 oxygen consumption and lower the thyroid function.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:17.740
 And so it's maybe acting early on in the whole process

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.540
 of from inflammation to fibrosis to calcification

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:23.860
 or it's during the whole thing.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:27.620
 - Yeah, like parathyroid hormone

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:32.620
 turns off oxidative energy production

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.460
 and shifts over to lactic acid production.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:41.460
 So you get a substitution of protective carbon dioxide

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:49.140
 which hardens the bone tissue and keeps soft tissue soft

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:56.180
 and instead you get lactate which softens the bone tissue

00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:00.420
 and tends to calcify your arteries and other tissues.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.860
 - Are estrogen and prolactin also involved

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:07.140
 in activating the stem cells in response to tissue injury

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.340
 and then carbon dioxide is supposed to kick in

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:12.540
 and differentiate them into normal organs.

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:14.540
 But if that doesn't happen, then basically

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.740
 too many stem cells and you get cancer?

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:17.580
 - I think so.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:22.780
 - Awesome, and then one thing we didn't touch on

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.260
 was the role of fibrin.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.300
 That seems like it kind of kicks things off

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.580
 and leaks out of the cell and causes havoc to other cells.

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:30.420
 Is that right?

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.860
 - Yeah.

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.100
 - Is it produced by the liver mostly?

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:40.020
 - Fibrinogen is produced in the liver

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:45.020
 and normally there's a constant balance,

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:51.780
 a whole system of enzymes that produce fibrin

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:56.940
 and tend to form clots.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:03.060
 But this fibrin that is constantly being produced

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.940
 from the background of fibrinogen,

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:12.460
 a very thin layer of it is normally deposited

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:16.180
 on the inside of capillaries,

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:19.740
 giving them a little extra strength,

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:24.740
 like just a reinforcing film

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:28.580
 and on the outside of red blood cells.

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:33.580
 And one of the factors that governs the balance

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:38.700
 between this constant formation of a small amount of fibrin

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:43.260
 and the constant breakdown thinning of that layer

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.820
 so it doesn't get too thick,

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:51.500
 one of the main factors governing this balance is estrogen.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:56.340
 So a high estrogen person gradually gets

00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:00.100
 thicker capillaries, linings,

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:03.160
 and thicker coating on the red blood cells,

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:08.180
 making oxygen take longer to get out of the red cell

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:10.780
 and through the capillary into the tissue.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:15.260
 And probably just about every hormone we have

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:17.700
 is contributing to that balance,

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:22.700
 but estrogen has been studied as a regulator.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:27.900
 And just recently people are starting to see

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:32.900
 the D-dimer breakdown fraction of fibrin

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:40.700
 that indicates how much stress there is,

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:44.780
 or in the case of estrogen,

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:48.820
 it indicates how excessive your estrogen is

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.660
 because you have the enzymes,

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:56.780
 proteolytic enzymes breaking down the coating

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.860
 so it doesn't get too thick.

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:03.860
 And that does seem to be happening in a stress disease

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:08.740
 or a viral disease like COVID-19.

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:14.700
 And so just checking the blood for the D-dimer

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:18.840
 is a way of seeing how much stress your system is under.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.140
 - So basically it's a biomarker for clotting.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:24.700
 - I didn't hear that.

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:25.660
 - It's a biomarker,

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.500
 it's a reliable systemic biomarker for clotting.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.740
 - Yeah, and the regulators,

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.500
 several of the regulators,

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:42.740
 iron for example, high ferritin and high hepsedin,

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:48.220
 which is sort of a blocker of iron uptake.

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:54.940
 Both the ferritin and the hepsedin levels

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:57.900
 are increased in COVID,

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:02.900
 and that goes with the defect in the red blood cell

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:07.060
 iron physiology.

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.340
 - Did you see the recent study that came out

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:13.820
 that said vitamin E, specifically alpha-tocopherol,

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.940
 drastically inhibits viral,

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.940
 specifically for COVID-19, for SARS-CoV-2,

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.380
 just 10 micromole per liter concentration

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:22.840
 basically obliterated the virus.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:23.980
 But now I'm thinking,

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:27.300
 since vitamin E also has anti-clotting effect,

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.700
 anti-estrogenic effect,

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.020
 potentially even anti-serotonin effect,

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.380
 it may have additional benefits

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.440
 if COVID-19 is mostly a clotting disease.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:42.440
 - Yeah, have you read the Schutt family's works?

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:49.920
 Evan Schutt was one of the sons,

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.440
 the father and two sons.

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:55.960
 They started out showing that vitamin E

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.680
 promotes fertility by blocking

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.960
 the anti-fertility effects of estrogen.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.840
 And one of the effects of estrogen

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:09.680
 was exaggerated clotting of the blood,

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:13.240
 and vitamin E in protecting

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.420
 against all of the effects of estrogen.

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:22.520
 They followed up and showed that it would accelerate

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.480
 the removal of established blood clots

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:29.720
 in various circulatory diseases

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.700
 and protect the heart from forming new clots.

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:38.160
 And it turns out that estrogen

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.960
 is a basic pro-inflammatory activator.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:47.880
 Vitamin E as a very essential anti-estrogen factor

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:53.280
 is also a very fundamental anti-inflammatory agent.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.400
 It works at several levels

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:59.560
 to prevent prostaglandin toxic effects.

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.840
 - Does every viral infection involve inflammation

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.920
 in one shape or form?

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.800
 - I think so.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.760
 - So that's why aspirin, vitamin E, progesterone,

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.820
 things like that, aside from any direct antiviral effects,

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:15.580
 they're simply stopping the inflammatory cascade,

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:18.240
 which is really what eventually kills people

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.400
 if the condition is really severe.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:25.280
 - Yeah, basically, we wouldn't be bothered

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:30.280
 by viruses getting churned out

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:35.320
 and produced and eliminated.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:39.840
 It's the inflammation that some of them produce.

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.440
 - So is it fair to say that, I mean,

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.520
 since we already discussed

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.000
 that maybe the evolutionary purpose of viruses

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.600
 is horizontal gene transfer, more or less,

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:50.520
 then the only reason we get these viral diseases

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.240
 is simply our suboptimal health state,

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.040
 not that the viruses are necessarily trying to kill us?

00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.840
 - Yeah, it's the same with our exosomes,

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:06.440
 the particles that we make as part of our repair,

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.680
 maintenance, and development processes,

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:13.920
 communication of genetic material and proteins

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:18.540
 and hormones between cells for regulation and development.

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:25.720
 The viruses are almost identical to our own exosomes.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:29.440
 They're made by the same machinery,

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.160
 are roughly the same size and structure and so on.

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:40.560
 So when you're in a weakened state

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:46.120
 where you are susceptible to viruses

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:50.260
 and get exaggeratedly sick from a cold virus

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:55.260
 like COVID, you're also likely to be having poor reactions

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.560
 to your own exosomes.

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:04.600
 And a sick cell can put out sickness

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:09.200
 communicating exosomes.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.600
 So a tumor can produce tumors

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:17.600
 by sending bad exosomes around the body.

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.540
 I think that's a way of thinking

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:25.540
 of why viruses vary in their harmfulness.

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:29.220
 - So as you mentioned before,

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:32.420
 during stress cells start shedding their retroviruses

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:33.680
 into the bloodstream.

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.020
 Are these retroviruses just a simple,

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:37.700
 harmless signaling mechanism,

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.980
 or can they actually cause issues?

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:43.940
 You know, you know the main theory that HIV is causing AIDS,

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:45.720
 it's been disputed many times

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.100
 since it's a retrovirus, right?

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.460
 I mean, it's not supposed to be harmful for us.

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:52.180
 Do you think there's any situation

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:56.260
 where these exosomes retroviruses released by the cell

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.880
 during stress can cause issues?

00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:02.620
 - Yeah, in the case of cancer, for example.

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:03.700
 - Okay.

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:07.980
 - Cancer cell is a profoundly stressed cell

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:14.140
 and it sends out crazy alarm signals as exosomes.

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.540
 - Speaking of coronavirus,

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.160
 I wanted to talk about David E. Martin, Ray,

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.500
 who you've mentioned a few times

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.380
 on your more recent interviews.

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.020
 But first I wanted to talk about your newsletter.

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:29.340
 So the newsletter is available by email now.

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:32.580
 It's $28, which can be paid through PayPal

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:35.900
 at rayPeats with an S, newsletter@gmail.com.

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:39.300
 And so we were talking earlier about your new newsletter,

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:42.340
 which should come out somewhere around the end of August.

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:43.180
 Is that right?

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:48.340
 - Oh, no, I'm hoping to get it written this coming week

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:49.940
 and quickly mailed.

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:53.420
 So hopefully before the 10th of August.

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.740
 - Oh, amazing, okay.

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:58.220
 And then same deal with rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com

00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:01.020
 and they can email that address to order

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.700
 from PMS to menopause, progesterone

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.980
 and orthomolecular medicine, generative energy,

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:07.780
 my favorite, mind and tissue or nutrition for women.

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:08.820
 Is that also correct?

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:10.980
 - Right.

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:11.800
 - Perfect.

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:16.140
 And then I wanted to talk about Progest-E from Keenogen.

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:21.140
 You can email Catherine to purchasedprogestekeenogen@gmail.com

00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:25.580
 and so something, you know, Ray, we talked about,

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.700
 maybe it's 2016.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.580
 I told you that I thought I was contributing

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.900
 to lots of my own problems by taking oral supplements.

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.960
 And so since then I've been much more partial

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:39.960
 to using topical, like oily substances on my skin.

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.180
 And so what do you think about using progesterone

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.760
 on your skin if somebody noticed

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:50.120
 that they had some kind of digestive irritation from it?

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:56.400
 - First of all, any vitamin E is,

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.980
 if it's pure, it's very viscous

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:05.260
 and has an unappealing taste

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.240
 and the viscosity going down your throat.

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:14.420
 And a lot of people will trigger a retching reaction

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:20.260
 and can irritate just by its viscosity.

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:25.060
 And so one solution is to mix it with butter

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:29.200
 or put it in your baked potato or whatever

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:34.200
 that prevents that concentrated oil reaction.

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:39.300
 And that's a problem with lots of supplement.

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:44.300
 People take their vitamins or minerals as tablets

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:48.460
 rather than as blended into their foods.

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:52.820
 So apart from any impurities

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:55.340
 that are causing allergic reactions,

00:54:55.340 --> 00:55:00.340
 just the fact of a pure chemical hitting your stomach

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:03.900
 can injure it to some extent.

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:08.900
 But to lower the viscosity of the vitamin E

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:12.900
 so that it will go in your skin faster,

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.820
 you can add a little bit of olive oil

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:17.820
 onto your skin first

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:22.820
 and then spread the viscous progesterone onto it.

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:29.140
 You don't wanna mix it in the bottle

00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:32.940
 because the extra olive oil

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:35.380
 tends to destabilize the solution.

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:37.820
 But mixing it right on your skin,

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:40.440
 you'll get a much faster absorption.

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:47.300
 Somewhere around 10% of it is likely to go into your body.

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:49.500
 So it takes a bigger dose

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:54.500
 even on top of the accelerating olive oil.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:56:02.340
 One woman who had two rigid hands from arthritis,

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:05.900
 we experimented on her hands

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:10.900
 rubbing pure progesterone onto the back of one hand

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:15.540
 and adding some olive oil with progesterone

00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.100
 to the other hand.

00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:21.100
 And in less than an hour,

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:26.100
 she could flex and have normal function in the hand

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:31.140
 that had the olive oil added to the progesterone.

00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:33.700
 It accelerates the absorption that fast.

00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:38.740
 - I have another cool report about Progest-T.

00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:40.980
 One of your female clients

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:43.040
 who has been buying these bottles for her mom

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.940
 who has dementia, she's in her late 80s,

00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:47.660
 and urinary incontinence.

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:49.860
 And she emails me once in a while

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:53.500
 asking about why taking progesterone orally

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:54.900
 irritates her mom's stomach.

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:57.060
 And we discussed several other methods.

00:56:57.060 --> 00:57:00.740
 And I suggested that she try a drop in each nostril.

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:03.100
 And apparently that worked tremendously well

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:06.420
 and her mom is now back and taking care of herself

00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.860
 and the urinary incontinence is gone.

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.940
 And apparently she can get by just by using a single drop

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:15.020
 in each nostril which makes the bottle last for months.

00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:20.220
 Do you have any qualms or like misgivings

00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:24.020
 about nasal administration of Progest-E?

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.140
 - With any oil in your nose,

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:29.060
 you have to be careful with the quantity

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:32.940
 because if it gets high enough

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:35.380
 that it can rain down into your lungs,

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:38.620
 oil in your lungs is something

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:42.100
 you absolutely want to avoid.

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:43.580
 - It's only one drop in each nostril.

00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:47.220
 She said that's plenty and it immediately puts her to sleep.

00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:49.180
 She sleeps through the night without waking up,

00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:52.580
 without peeing her pants.

00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:54.500
 And apparently now both problems,

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.500
 the dementia and the incontinence are gone

00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.040
 just by one drop in each nostril.

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.580
 Very good.

00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.060
 - Ray, can you critique my approach?

00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:03.420
 So for the last few years,

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.660
 I've been taking like an eighth of a teaspoon.

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:08.900
 So that's like what, 50 milligrams of progesterone

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:11.700
 and then whatever, how much I've mixed in with DHEA

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:15.180
 and I'm putting it from my like knee to my ankle

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.540
 and I'll put the olive oil on first.

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:18.780
 Do you think that's too much

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:23.660
 for a average sized knee to ankle leg?

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:27.820
 - No, that's about what I use.

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:32.360
 - And would you ever use more than one eighth on one leg?

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:36.960
 - Oh, if I have a sore elbow or something,

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:41.680
 yeah, I'll put maybe a quarter of a teaspoon on it

00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:45.800
 with some olive oil and cover from shoulder to hand.

00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:49.760
 Get as much in as possible to,

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:54.680
 as quickly as possible to get rid of the inflammation.

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:56.180
 - Interesting, okay.

00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:58.040
 In order to improve the absorption,

00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:00.700
 do you think it helps to like thoroughly clean the skin

00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:02.360
 with rubbing alcohol before that?

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:06.160
 - After a bath, it really is good

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.400
 if you can soak your skin

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:11.700
 so that the top layer of skin comes off.

00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:15.320
 - Okay, and then I know I've asked you before

00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:19.220
 and it might've been on that 2016 safe supplements episode,

00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:22.640
 but with progest, like obviously if you were putting

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.020
 whatever the amount was, whatever teaspoon,

00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.100
 half teaspoon or whatever,

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:27.920
 that that would be very sticky, right?

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.760
 But that doesn't mean you're wasting it.

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:33.720
 If it's sticky, you would just be using more of it.

00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:34.560
 Is that right?

00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:37.780
 - Well, if it's noticeably sticky,

00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:40.620
 it's gonna get under your clothes and bedding

00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:44.400
 and it doesn't do any good on your clothes and bedding.

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.080
 - It ruins them.

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:48.080
 (laughing)

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:51.880
 - If you rub it thoroughly,

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:56.240
 you won't see any stickiness or shininess left.

00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:01.000
 And that means it has a good proportion of it

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.560
 is far enough into your skin

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.640
 that it's getting into the blood.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.480
 - Okay, interesting.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.300
 And I just do this every day.

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.080
 That's why I'm asking you so many questions about it.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.680
 But you don't need that much olive oil

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.920
 because you couldn't,

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.920
 if you use a lot of olive oil and the progest,

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:18.920
 it'd be just like a shiny slick type of skin, right?

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.200
 - Yeah, just two or three drops of olive oil

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.480
 for a leg is enough.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.640
 - Okay, that's extremely good to know.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.480
 Do you have any other questions, Roger,

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.440
 and we can move on?

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.280
 - No.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.100
 - Okay.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:31.680
 Okay, so we have questions.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.760
 We have some good questions

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:36.160
 that I thought would be interesting to bounce off of you.

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.840
 Did you wanna talk about David E. Martin?

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.520
 I thought, you know,

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.760
 what is there to say about all this stuff that's going on

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.160
 that hasn't been said?

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.960
 And watching his videos,

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.320
 I thought were extremely interesting.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.780
 You know, his evidence,

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:51.960
 his hardcore evidence-based approach with the patents.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:55.400
 Is there anything that needs to be said about his work

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.600
 and what he's found?

01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:03.760
 - Yeah, some people worry about his credentials

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.920
 and background and the fact that he wears several big rings.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:15.880
 And he seems to have studied oratory from Bob Hope

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:22.680
 and Jack Benny, when you watch his delivery

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.320
 of profoundly disturbing information,

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:32.320
 and he does a Bob Hope or a Jack Benny pause.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:38.000
 He's extremely effective,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.680
 but you just have to accept

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.340
 that he isn't a medical professor.

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:47.440
 - Well, it seems like he was like a double threat

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.840
 'cause he understood the law.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.180
 And then, I mean, everything I heard him,

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:52.760
 I only watched one or two videos of him,

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.240
 but everything he said, he seemed like

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.220
 he understood the science as well.

01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:01.080
 - Yeah, obviously, it's extremely bright.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.480
 - Yeah, and then in one of the,

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.160
 I don't know how to say the guy's name,

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.160
 the Reiner Vollmik,

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.400
 but when they were talking in German

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.760
 and then he said he understood what they were saying,

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.120
 I was like, "Oh, yeah, this guy's pretty smart."

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.360
 (laughs)

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.760
 But yeah, and then in one of those videos,

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:20.720
 he was talking about a quote

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.400
 that Georgie and I talked about last week

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.840
 from Peter Daszak, you know, that, I mean,

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.360
 I know there are a lot of smoking guns in this,

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:31.840
 but do you know what quote I'm talking about?

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.880
 He says, "We need to increase the public."

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.740
 I mean, that seems really like a smoking gun almost.

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:42.960
 - Yeah, if we get the media to hype the pandemic,

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:48.460
 the investor money will fall.

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:53.460
 So those people,

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:59.340
 Ralph Berrick, the germ warfare virus designer,

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:02.460
 has commented on how much money

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:07.300
 they're going to get from this work.

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:12.140
 Money is the basic motivator

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:17.140
 as well as whatever evil germ warfare is involved.

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:20.260
 - And then towards the end of that quote,

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:22.300
 he says, "We need to use the hype to our advantage

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:23.860
 "to get to the real issues."

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.860
 And so the real issues being

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:28.620
 what Eric Schmidt is talking about

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.660
 and what we talked about a little before we went live,

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.700
 the destruction of the legacy,

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:37.400
 so-called legacy systems and people's livelihoods

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.240
 and not wanting to compete and playing the empire game.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:47.860
 - Yeah, what Eric Schmidt outlined in detail in 2019

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:56.220
 was happening to a considerable extent already in 2020

01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:02.540
 with many billions of dollars lost by common people,

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:09.540
 working people and small businesses collapsing

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.100
 all across the country.

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:15.180
 And all of that wealth being concentrated

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:20.180
 in Amazon and the drug companies,

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:25.180
 a few billionaires getting huge multiplications

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:31.340
 of their wealth while the traditional economics

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:35.380
 of people working and having their businesses

01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:37.020
 was collapsing.

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:41.780
 Exactly what Schmidt said had to be engineered

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.420
 for the US to get ahead of China

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:50.260
 by developing artificial intelligence

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:55.260
 to do the work rather than an ordinary human-based economy.

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:58.500
 - I have a question about China.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.240
 I mean, yes, it does some good things for its people,

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.580
 but it seems like their system is not much different

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.420
 at its core.

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:06.360
 It's still the same thing.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.580
 It's using people as assets without much care

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.420
 and worry about the individual person

01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:14.180
 or allowing them the freedom to expand

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.020
 and live their lives meaningfully.

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:20.500
 - Yeah, they are just better capitalists

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.500
 than their opposition.

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:30.420
 They're using capital in a fairly arrogant way,

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:38.220
 but they're helping to eliminate poverty in China

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:43.240
 and that will increase the productivity

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.560
 of their population.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:50.400
 So it's going to be profitable to the people

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.880
 invested in their industry.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:56.620
 So it's not at all anti-capitalist.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:01.620
 But the good thing about them is that they don't have

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.960
 hundreds of military bases around the world.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.100
 - So they can pour these resources,

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:10.900
 at least for now, into their people

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.240
 until they decide otherwise, maybe one day.

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:18.180
 - Yeah, but they have a history of several thousand years

01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:23.180
 of not going abroad to enslave people.

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:26.560
 - And Ray, I apologize.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.380
 I know we talked about this before we went live,

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:31.620
 but it might be worth mentioning just for everyone.

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:34.800
 So there was a quote, I think it came from an interaction

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.080
 with you with somebody from November, 2020.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.980
 And it was, you guys had a few back and forths

01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:41.820
 and one of them was,

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:43.740
 "Since RNA vaccines haven't been used before,

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:45.260
 "there's no way of telling in detail,

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:47.260
 "but there's no doubt that general immunity

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.360
 "will be seriously damaged.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.940
 "Looking at the dismal results

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:51.760
 "of vaccination campaigns so far,

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.060
 "I think it could reduce world population by 80 or 90%."

01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:58.780
 And so I posted that and I thought it sounded like

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:01.500
 you put some people were saying it might have even been fake

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:04.200
 and so is there anything to clarify with that?

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.900
 - Could reduce the population, could annihilate

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:12.180
 every last human being,

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:16.520
 could kill off elephants and wombats as well.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:21.300
 But we just don't know how deadly it's going to be.

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:26.300
 It's already killed 18,000 people in Europe,

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:30.740
 something like 10,000 in the US.

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:34.420
 They keep changing the numbers from six to 12,000

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:37.560
 and back to six at the CDC.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:42.560
 But anyway, it's verified that it is killing thousands,

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:48.060
 but the biology of it indicates that it could keep killing

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:56.300
 not just the acute first days and weeks and months,

01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:00.440
 but that damaged the immune system.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:05.900
 It's fairly likely to accelerate

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:10.140
 all of the inflammatory aging processes.

01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:12.900
 And there are even the mechanisms,

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:17.380
 for example, the vaccine is known to concentrate

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:22.380
 in the ovaries and if it transmits that ability

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:26.540
 to produce spike protein to the next generation,

01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:32.620
 then the weakening of the biology of the offspring

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:39.020
 could mean that the longevity of that generation

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:41.820
 is drastically reduced.

01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:46.400
 And so over a period of a few generations,

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.820
 what they're doing now, you can't foresee

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:55.820
 that it isn't gonna kill off the majority of the species.

01:08:55.820 --> 01:09:00.020
 - Did you see the study about the women

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:03.380
 who took the vaccine in the first or second trimester

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:06.960
 had more than 88% of spontaneous abortions?

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.620
 - No, I didn't see that,

01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:14.620
 but the World Health Organization for years

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:20.060
 has been advocating giving flu vaccine to pregnant women.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:24.820
 And the vaccine has adjuvants intended

01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:28.180
 to create systemic inflammation.

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:33.180
 And it's firmly established in animals and humans

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:39.300
 that inflammation during pregnancy

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:44.140
 causes damage to the fetus, all degrees of damage,

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:49.140
 brain damage and shape of the organs and so on.

01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:53.740
 So what they've been doing in pregnancy

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:57.980
 is a large scale crime.

01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:05.460
 Now for them to do this experimental treatment

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:08.700
 on pregnant women is just hard to believe.

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:10.980
 - As far as the vaccines,

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:14.660
 I know the mRNA vaccine can get incorporated into our DNA.

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.100
 There's even a study that came out

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.800
 demonstrating that it's possible.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.500
 What about the DNA vector vaccines

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.540
 like AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson?

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:22.960
 Is the damage, is the risk to them

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.500
 mostly related to the inflammatory state

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:26.860
 that they cause for a few months

01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:29.720
 while the dead foreign DNA is in the body?

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:39.220
 - Yeah, what form is their DNA?

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:44.460
 Is it in a different virus or a constructed virus?

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:47.340
 - Well, I think they're basically taking,

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:51.180
 I mean the mRNA vaccine has a synthetic portion

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.440
 of the spike protein, right?

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.320
 Synthetically created.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.660
 And the DNA vaccines, the vector vaccines,

01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.180
 I think they have, again,

01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.100
 a synthetic version of a spike protein

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:02.260
 different from the RNA vaccine,

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:06.380
 but it's encapsulated into a chimpanzee adenovirus

01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:07.820
 and that's what they're using it to get it

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:08.720
 inside of the cell.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.220
 So I know there is horizontal gene transfer,

01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:13.100
 so there's still the potential for this

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:15.640
 getting to be incorporated in our tissues,

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.220
 but probably less so than the mRNA, right?

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:23.260
 - Well, if the RNA gets into the cell,

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.540
 the same thing can happen to it.

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:28.340
 - Okay, so it doesn't matter that it's a vector vaccine,

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.940
 it's still that foreign protein that it carries,

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:33.300
 that piece of spike protein,

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.300
 it can still get incorporated.

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:36.140
 - Yeah.

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:38.780
 - Last thing before we move on to questions here,

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:41.980
 and I feel like you can't state your hypothesis enough,

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:45.140
 you know, 'cause so many people are getting into your work,

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:46.760
 but anyways, I posted something

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:49.220
 from your 1994 "Generative Energy" book,

01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:51.500
 and it was, "More life and more energy can solve

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.560
 many of the basic problems of life."

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.980
 And then I put Albert St. Georgie's quote,

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.280
 it's like an abridged quote,

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.420
 but, "The more life does, the more life it is."

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:01.380
 Dot, dot, dot.

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.440
 "Life supports life.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.260
 Function builds structure,

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.860
 and structure produces function."

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:06.700
 Dot, dot, dot.

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:09.280
 And I, again, you know, it's the core

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.500
 to a lot of things you're talking about.

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.840
 Is there anything more to say about that

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.160
 that hasn't been said?

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:20.160
 - Yeah, in one of his simple experiments on rabbits,

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:25.240
 he showed that progesterone allows the heart muscle,

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:29.960
 and by implication, other smooth muscles,

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:34.000
 allows the heart muscle to build structure,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.720
 so that function, the more the heart functions,

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.920
 the better the structure is,

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:44.920
 permitting a more adequate pumping action.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:52.080
 Seeing a concrete version of what you just quoted from him,

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:57.660
 that progesterone facilitates that energy and function,

01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:04.640
 builds structure, and structure enables better function.

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.260
 - I love it.

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.080
 Thanks for that.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:08.920
 And then, Georgie,

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:09.760
 if you have another question,

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.660
 we'll just move on to these questions that I've pulled.

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:15.160
 - It's more of a, I mean,

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:18.200
 it's an article that I saw that came out this week.

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.600
 It's related to Einstein,

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.900
 and I guess another house of cards collapsing.

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:25.160
 As Ray, you know, Einstein said,

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:28.360
 he replaced the ether with the space-time continuum,

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.760
 and he said, "We don't need the ether.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.840
 This space-time continuum can do everything

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.240
 that the ether could do."

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.120
 And basically, it has no properties.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.680
 And now they just came out with a proof

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.720
 that electromagnetism is a basic property of space-time,

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.040
 which means that, I guess, Einstein was,

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:45.920
 not that proven wrong,

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.400
 but that the idea of this abstract, empty space

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:52.080
 that somehow is devoid of properties,

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:55.400
 and I think that kind of gave the impetus

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.440
 to the development of a lot of abstract reductionist theories

01:13:58.440 --> 01:13:59.600
 in the 20th century,

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.400
 that seems to be now on its way out.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.900
 - Yeah, and you know,

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:08.900
 the Michelson-Morley experiment didn't show a null effect.

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:14.300
 It showed something like a 20% drag effect of the ether.

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:19.660
 And then, I think it was Morley and Mitchell,

01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:27.200
 I think, did the follow-up work for many years,

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.420
 over and over,

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:33.980
 showing the original experiment,

01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:36.340
 but in more and more refined ways,

01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:40.420
 in basements and on higher mountains and so on,

01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:45.420
 showing that the Earth does drag an ether with it,

01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:49.020
 affecting the velocity of light

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:51.860
 according to the direction the Earth is moving.

01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:53.740
 - Yep, and I think there's one

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.620
 that NASA commissioned in the '80s,

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:56.460
 which, for some reason,

01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:58.180
 it's not getting much publication.

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:00.300
 Well, maybe because it confirmed the ether again.

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:02.980
 It's by a physicist, I think his name is Silverlight.

01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:04.460
 I don't know if you've heard of him,

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:07.260
 but he was a staff NASA physicist,

01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:09.620
 and apparently the guy that they went to

01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:12.680
 when they wanted to debunk really controversial claims,

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.460
 and he confirmed the ether again,

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:16.060
 and NASA got really angry and said

01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.180
 that the reason for his results

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.540
 was abnormal temperature in the room

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:22.540
 where he was conducting the experiments.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:29.500
 - Yeah, and those follow-ups to the Michelson-Morley experiment

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:33.700
 carefully controlled for temperature

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:36.740
 because that had been brought out

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:40.520
 as a defense of the space-time thing,

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.020
 and they absolutely showed

01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:46.760
 that the temperature wasn't involved.

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:49.740
 - Ray, have you ever heard that NASA stands

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:51.360
 for not a space agency?

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.700
 (laughing)

01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:55.900
 - I heard they, somebody said they say that in the CIA,

01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:59.820
 but whatever, okay, so here are some questions.

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:00.880
 Some of these are pretty heavy,

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.380
 and so feel free to talk about as much or as little

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:04.820
 about any of these as you want.

01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:06.300
 Georgie, were you gonna say something?

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:07.140
 - No. - Oh, okay.

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:08.540
 I thought you were pointing with your hand.

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:11.820
 Okay, this one's from Green, and they say,

01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:13.980
 "He has many nutritional physiological tools

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:15.360
 "to improve metabolism.

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.680
 "What kind of personality changes can be made?

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:19.940
 "What is a healthy way to look at the world,

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:22.780
 "or what is an unhealthy way to look at the world?"

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:25.040
 (clicking)

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.760
 - I think it's important to get pleasure

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:34.660
 from looking at the world.

01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:40.820
 Intrinsically, the process of being involved

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:44.640
 and learning from the world gives pleasure.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:48.580
 Insight is pleasurable,

01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:52.900
 and the attitude towards the world,

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:57.900
 that it's a place to be dutiful and do your work,

01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:03.460
 that is a less healthy approach to reality.

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:07.660
 Everything should be more or less spontaneous and fun

01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:12.220
 and intrinsically motivating to continue in that direction.

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:15.300
 - I have a question about this.

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:17.640
 If attitude is largely the result

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.860
 of what the world and the environment

01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:21.820
 allows our health to be,

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:22.860
 isn't it a bit of a,

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:25.740
 I mean, shouldn't we be not forcing a particular attitude?

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.120
 I mean, if the world is,

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:29.660
 if the environment is crappy and oppressing us,

01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:31.340
 isn't it normal to feel down?

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:34.300
 And isn't it abnormal to try to force ourselves

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.640
 into positive thinking in such situations?

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:42.460
 - Well, not force, but to find the route

01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:45.700
 to get to the different state

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:48.120
 where you aren't being oppressed by the world.

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.800
 - Okay, the real reason I'm bringing this up

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.600
 is because I'm sure you've seen

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.540
 when they get these terminally ill patients,

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:56.480
 they're trying to improve their suffering

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.680
 by doing humor as a therapy.

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:01.160
 And I always thought, what a bizarre situation.

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:03.140
 Here are these people dying from cancer,

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:04.040
 some of them children,

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.800
 and then there's this clown, literally a clown,

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.360
 in addition to the other clowns in white coats,

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.680
 trying to make them crack a smile,

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:13.240
 and the children are,

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.600
 you can see that they're suffering,

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:15.680
 they're struggling to smile,

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:17.720
 and they don't wanna be entertained.

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.740
 It's not entertaining, they're in pain.

01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:22.480
 So in situations like that, it's more natural.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.320
 I don't know, I mean,

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.580
 I guess you can find other ways to improve their lives

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.220
 instead of forcing them to be happy.

01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:29.240
 That would be pathological, right?

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.080
 - Right.

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.600
 - Great stuff.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:33.840
 I had another follow-up question

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.000
 that I don't remember what it was.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.920
 Anyways, okay, so this one's from MG Athlete.

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.680
 They say, "Ray has mentioned process theology before.

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:47.320
 "Can you ask to expand on how he has arrived at that

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.660
 "and his experience with religion/church in his life?"

01:18:50.660 --> 01:19:00.320
 - Well, my experience of the world

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:05.000
 right from the beginning was a process

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.280
 that I was involved in,

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:11.200
 the nature of my being and the nature of other beings,

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:17.100
 everything was obviously an ongoing process

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:24.360
 in which all of the entities were actually processes

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:31.200
 rather than having any fixed points of reference

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:36.800
 other than as part of a general picture

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.240
 that you're putting together.

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:44.520
 And then reading William Blake when I was 18,

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:51.820
 I saw that his orientation was essentially similar

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:54.780
 and then Alfred North Whitehead

01:19:54.780 --> 01:20:00.900
 right around the same time went into details

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:05.580
 and he gave that name of process and reality

01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:10.380
 which that orientation is now called

01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:14.880
 either process philosophy or process theology.

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:19.880
 And it's in place of all of the theological apparatus

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:28.340
 it sees universe as processes at every point.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:38.680
 - And that view is, is it heretical in a biblical sense

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:42.960
 because it's, or is there things that point towards that?

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:46.280
 Like how did Griffin arrive at that?

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.360
 Like how do you still be religious

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.460
 and believe the Bible with that?

01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:50.520
 I'm not saying you do that,

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:53.800
 but it seems disconnected from like the Bible

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:54.780
 that I'm aware of.

01:20:54.780 --> 01:21:01.320
 - Yeah, Griffin, he was in a Bible school

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:04.960
 a couple of blocks from the University of Oregon

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.040
 when I was in graduate school there.

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:13.840
 He studied his way out of fundamentalism

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:19.080
 and found his way to that same viewpoint

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.760
 by studying Whitehead.

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:24.120
 - And just to be completely clear,

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:24.960
 when somebody asked you this,

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:28.120
 you said my view is closest to process theology.

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:30.420
 It wasn't process theology per se, correct?

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:37.200
 - No, I could call it Blakeian consciousness as easily.

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:43.400
 - Isn't that similar in outlook to phenomenology?

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.520
 Basically that life is a consciousness

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:47.760
 with interaction with the world around it?

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:54.040
 - Yeah, and it depends on your definition of phenomenology.

01:21:54.040 --> 01:22:00.640
 Husserl himself sketched it out

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:04.600
 as something that sounded just right

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:08.080
 to be aware of your awareness

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:12.920
 and essentially to feel yourself as a process

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:16.720
 within processes.

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:20.280
 But then Husserl, for some reason,

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:23.740
 tried to reduce it to Platonic reductionism.

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:26.360
 Very weird.

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.680
 - He became idealistic.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:32.680
 Have you noticed that when your metabolism is at its best,

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:33.880
 you basically tend to,

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:34.720
 I don't know if it happens to you,

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:35.560
 but it happens to be,

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.160
 you tend to suspend judgment

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.580
 in regards to the events that you experience?

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:44.200
 - Yeah, because your thoughts are best

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:49.200
 when they extend and incorporate a large span of time.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:55.080
 Only by suspending judgment

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.840
 can you fill up your consciousness

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.760
 with what it takes to support that perception

01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.160
 and understand it.

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:06.200
 - Love that.

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.240
 Okay, this next question is from Phil Graves.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:12.240
 He says, "What does Ray think of Marx's scientific method

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.720
 "and social revolution?"

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:22.680
 - Several Christians and capitalists

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:28.320
 have said Marx's science was very useful.

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:33.360
 For example, Nelson Rockefeller said

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:37.840
 he understood Marx's,

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:42.840
 as well as the leftist reporters he was talking to,

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:47.800
 but he used Marx's ideas

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:51.180
 to increase his power and wealth.

01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:55.700
 That's the nature of a science.

01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:59.180
 Anyone can use it to do what they want to

01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:01.580
 for good or bad purposes.

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:06.580
 But where Marx got his ethical orientation

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:10.960
 was right out of Christianity.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:15.500
 Christian communism and Christian socialism

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:19.260
 had been going on almost 2,000 years

01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:24.260
 when Marx created a scientific understanding

01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:31.220
 of why society is built the way it is.

01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:36.900
 But the way you use that scientific understanding,

01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:42.620
 Rockefeller knew it could be good for him

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:45.080
 to understand society that way.

01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:50.780
 - I just, the thing I feel like

01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:54.060
 we will get comments down below.

01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:55.580
 I feel like people are gonna say,

01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:58.100
 "All this stuff is because of Marx."

01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:59.760
 So what would you say to that?

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.180
 - All this stuff is what?

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:05.460
 - All this COVID stuff, like the making people-

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:07.860
 - The BLM, Black Lives Matter, the riots,

01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:10.020
 everything is driven by Marxist ideology.

01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:12.220
 - Yeah, everything's Marxism

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:13.420
 and they're imposing it on us.

01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:15.520
 Like, what would your response be to that?

01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:18.900
 - I don't see any connection at all.

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:21.160
 (laughing)

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:27.020
 You could say it's the Rockefeller world-controlling class,

01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:34.360
 the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and World Economic Forum.

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:39.980
 They might understand Marx and use Marx,

01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:44.020
 but Marx had the ethics that you should not

01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:47.940
 kill off billions of people.

01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:51.380
 - Great stuff, and then have you ever heard

01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:53.780
 that the Club of Rome, like the World Economic Forum

01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:55.420
 is like an extension of Club of Rome?

01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:57.540
 Have you ever heard that before?

01:25:57.540 --> 01:25:58.580
 - Extension of what?

01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:01.180
 - A Club of Rome, those people that-

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:04.300
 - Oh, Club of Rome, yeah, I think the same people

01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:09.420
 were involved, definitely the same class purposes.

01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:13.860
 - Yeah, nice, I thought that made the old elite history

01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:15.940
 and the new stuff make a little bit more sense

01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:18.260
 when somebody suggested that.

01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:19.100
 Thanks for that, Ray.

01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:22.660
 Okay, so, and I won't keep you longer.

01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:24.380
 We'll go another 25 minutes or so,

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:25.980
 and I sincerely appreciate it, Ray,

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:27.900
 coming on here, it's always really special when you do that.

01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:29.980
 And Georgi Dinkov, my partner in crime, thank you so much.

01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:31.800
 And thank you everybody for listening.

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.120
 These are always so fun to do,

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.820
 and we have such an amazing audience

01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:36.620
 and you guys all make that possible.

01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:39.980
 So sincere appreciation on my part.

01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:41.780
 Okay, so this next question is from Michael,

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:43.780
 and he says, how much, he has a bunch of questions,

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:46.860
 but I picked the, how much does intuitive thinking

01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:49.460
 coincide with intellectual processing?

01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:51.060
 And why does intuition at times

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:53.000
 seemingly lead us to poor choices?

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.660
 - Well, analysis and reasoning

01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:04.360
 can lead to horrible outcomes.

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:10.980
 Intuition, and the way it's different from simple reasoning

01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:18.140
 is that instead of starting with postulates

01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:22.540
 and leading to logical conclusions,

01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:27.540
 you're always open to change your postulates.

01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:32.580
 You have a flexible, open view of the world.

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:38.660
 That's an extreme, that's the process view of the world

01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:42.820
 where you don't, you aren't committed

01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:47.820
 to a formal defined set of logical statements,

01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:55.820
 and you're constantly refining

01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:57.880
 your hypothesis about the world.

01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:01.980
 So it's open to change,

01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:06.980
 or the rational approach to the world.

01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:12.740
 You have to get someone to write new algorithms for you,

01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:21.540
 and the organism is absolutely not a bunch of algorithms.

01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:26.820
 It's a process that is constantly revising itself.

01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:29.500
 - Do you think one of the reasons

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:32.660
 for intuition leading sometimes to bad outcomes

01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:34.700
 is because simple, we live in a world

01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:36.540
 that's been deliberately engineered

01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:38.780
 to disfavor such approach to life?

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:45.700
 - Yeah, it's trying to implant its doctrines

01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:48.940
 and ways of reasoning.

01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:54.080
 - And Ray, you maintain that, I don't know how to say this,

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:56.020
 but a pure type of intuition,

01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:59.260
 an animal intuition is altruistic in nature?

01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:04.800
 - Yeah, that's one of the properties of the,

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:10.500
 either liberation theology or process theology,

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:15.500
 or Marx's approach to understanding Marxism.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:26.340
 You have to recognize that there is a reality

01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:32.580
 to good and justice, and evil and injustice,

01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:37.580
 but the nature of the world is that

01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:43.440
 we are able to appreciate those differences,

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:49.380
 where the artificial intelligence type of rationalism

01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:55.620
 makes no difference between good and bad,

01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:58.360
 better and worse.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:01.540
 - And not to beat a dead horse here,

01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:05.900
 but that natural altruism or good nature,

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:10.900
 can that be overridden by lack of basic needs, do you think?

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:15.200
 - Yeah, by injuring the person or the animal.

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.180
 - Yeah, you've seen that study

01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:19.060
 with the locust and the grasshopper, right?

01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:22.180
 Where basically they simply injecting a grasshopper

01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:23.660
 with a little bit of serotonin,

01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:27.220
 turns them, usually they're gregarious,

01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:30.340
 they're playful, they're curious, they're altruistic.

01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:31.820
 You inject a little bit of serotonin

01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:34.980
 and then turn into cannibalistic homicidal beasts

01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:37.900
 that devour everything on their path, including each other.

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:41.360
 - Yeah, that's a good metaphor.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:45.260
 - Thanks for that, you two, appreciate it.

01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:47.260
 Okay, I skipped over this one accidentally.

01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:49.500
 This Macaroni Delta says,

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:54.260
 "Is the desire for revenge always serotonergic,

01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:58.060
 or can it have a place in a healthy person's psychology?"

01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:03.060
 - Yeah, I think if you've been slightly injured,

01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:14.700
 you have to process the damage that has been done.

01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:19.820
 And at least mentally, you can think of getting revenge

01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:27.420
 as restoring your wholeness.

01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:33.420
 It's a mental process of understanding

01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:37.300
 why a person would injure you,

01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:40.980
 and incorporating that.

01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:43.340
 You can have thoughts of revenge

01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:48.340
 as part of the process of how to interpret that

01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:53.660
 and go on without actually having to

01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:57.940
 do destructive, retaliatory things.

01:31:57.940 --> 01:32:05.420
 - There was a study with prisoners of war in Vietnam,

01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:08.460
 and they found out that the ones who psychiatrically/

01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:11.820
 psychologically did the best were the ones who fantasized

01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:15.000
 about either escape or getting back at their captors,

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.420
 but without acting upon it,

01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:19.420
 because the ones that did act upon it either got killed,

01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:22.660
 or for some reason, even when they were liberated

01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:25.860
 or managed to escape, they did not do well health-wise.

01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:28.520
 They ended up with a post-traumatic stress disorder

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.780
 or something else, but the ones that didn't revenge,

01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:33.420
 but had vivid imagery of how they're going to pay back

01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:37.140
 to their captors or escape, they seemed to do okay.

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:39.660
 - Yeah, that kind of mental imagery

01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:43.900
 is part of a healing process, I think,

01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:48.900
 activating your creative ability in a bad situation.

01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:55.900
 It can involve some bad images, but when you do it,

01:32:55.900 --> 01:33:00.900
 you can reconstruct yourself as a constructive,

01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:08.980
 ongoing person with responsibility for improving things.

01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:12.940
 - And it tends to happen when the person is isolated,

01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:15.180
 right, because normally they will talk to other people

01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:17.500
 and process their trauma through others,

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:18.980
 but if you're in a prisoner camp,

01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:21.100
 you don't have much opportunity to do that,

01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:22.700
 so you're essentially replacing that

01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:24.460
 with these vivid mental images.

01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:28.380
 - This actually ties in with the process theology, right?

01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:30.060
 Because in your Blake newsletter,

01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:31.740
 you say the desire for vengeance comes

01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:34.940
 with a delusive commitment to the world of memory.

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:37.600
 Virginity is constantly renewed in the world

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:38.920
 of the imaginative life.

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.580
 While Blake said that you can't forgive someone

01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:44.240
 until they stop hurting you, the desire to be forgiven

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:47.980
 indicates that there's an opportunity to resolve the problem.

01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:48.820
 - Yeah.

01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:49.900
 (Robert laughs)

01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:52.940
 - Also, and I think I detected what you said,

01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:55.660
 is like, if you understand kind of the,

01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:58.100
 maybe the pathological nature of the person

01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:00.380
 that's hurting you, does that alleviate

01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:02.580
 like the frustration maybe of, like,

01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:04.500
 why are they doing this, you know?

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:07.060
 - Yeah.

01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:12.060
 Once, a cop was extremely unjust,

01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:18.900
 and I thought intensely about that,

01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:23.900
 and what a miserable person he was,

01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:28.900
 but then in the process of mulling it over for a few hours,

01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:37.220
 I was able to put him in the context

01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:42.220
 and see him as a victim who suffered

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:48.500
 from various pressures that caused him

01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:51.260
 to become such a miserable thing.

01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:55.740
 - Didn't Mark say that even if you take a serial killer

01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:57.460
 and then you start digging through their life,

01:34:57.460 --> 01:35:00.220
 especially as a child, you'll quickly go

01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:04.420
 from very mad to very sad in regards to like,

01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:05.740
 to their persona?

01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:08.420
 So instead of hating them, you'll be like, wow,

01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:09.940
 you know, it makes total sense

01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:11.820
 that a person would act that way.

01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:16.260
 - Yeah, there are cases where a very bad cop

01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:21.260
 or criminal has got out of that situation

01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:27.380
 and sought forgiveness and realized

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:30.420
 what he had been doing and changed.

01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:32.980
 - So that's a very Christian ethic, right?

01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:35.180
 As long as you're willing to ask for forgiveness

01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:37.940
 and willing to work to improve your life,

01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:40.300
 then God will grant you forgiveness.

01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:45.660
 - Yeah, and it's basically a good biological reflex,

01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:47.180
 healthy biology.

01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:49.340
 - Would you agree with Alice Miller

01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:51.300
 when she says contempt is the weapon of the weak

01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:54.940
 and defense against one's own despised and unwanted feeling?

01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:57.260
 - Sounds right.

01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:58.740
 - Yeah. (laughs)

01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:00.140
 And I think you replied to somebody

01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:01.940
 about the development of these types

01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:04.220
 of authoritarian automatons,

01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:06.500
 and you suggested reading Alice Miller

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:09.740
 and Wilhelm Reich on how those people develop.

01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:11.900
 Great stuff.

01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:12.740
 Go ahead.

01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:14.660
 - I don't know.

01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:15.700
 - Oh, I thought I interrupted.

01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:17.140
 - I have a related question.

01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:21.980
 The theme of love is a very central theme in Christianity

01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:24.180
 and many religions, if not all of them.

01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:26.500
 And many people intuitively feel

01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:28.260
 that being in a relationship,

01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:31.580
 in an intensely loving relationship on both sides

01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:32.820
 is extremely therapeutic

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:34.860
 and gives tremendous meaning to life.

01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:36.740
 What is the physiological underpinning to that,

01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:37.580
 do you think?

01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:43.900
 - Well, it was already incorporated

01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:46.100
 at the time of Christianity.

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:51.100
 There's a few chapters in the Bible talk about that.

01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:55.580
 Reich, in his book, "The Murder of Christ,"

01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:58.860
 quotes a lot from the Bible,

01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:03.860
 and creates a very different orientation

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:08.180
 from what you hear in a lot of sermons.

01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:14.180
 A very biological, very Christian

01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:19.180
 and ethical approach towards the world.

01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:22.540
 - Right, but when somebody is in love

01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:25.420
 or feels loved and accepted,

01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:27.900
 do you think that the underlying mechanism

01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:30.260
 is basically you're completely stress-free

01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:32.980
 because the world, through this other human being,

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:34.420
 accepts you for who you are?

01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:36.580
 You don't need to pretend and do crazy things

01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:39.180
 in order to be accepted?

01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:43.460
 - Yeah, the primitive Christianity

01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:50.340
 was historically, for a couple hundred years,

01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:53.180
 that seemed to be the central theme.

01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:57.900
 Love thy neighbor in a practical way.

01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:00.940
 - Great stuff.

01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.020
 You know, we won't go too much longer here.

01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:03.660
 I'll let you go very soon, Reich.

01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:05.460
 I sincerely appreciate it.

01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:07.780
 This one's from Mac, and they say,

01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:09.380
 "Hi, Danny, I would love to hear more

01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:12.380
 about how the mind affects biological processes,

01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:13.500
 processes, however you say that,

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.660
 along the lines of mind and tissue.

01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:16.860
 I know you have spoken before

01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:20.420
 about how a stimulating life

01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:24.180
 encourages positive biological processes/processes,"

01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:25.180
 however you say that.

01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:28.700
 You know what I think they're talking about

01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:31.100
 is when you said in "Mind and Tissue,"

01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.620
 when you go outside to an interesting place

01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:36.260
 and the brain starts consuming tons of glucose

01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:37.740
 and it's very stimulating.

01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:39.940
 That's what reminded me of when I read this.

01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:42.020
 - Mm-hmm.

01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:48.180
 The way we think about the body and its organs,

01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:54.420
 we've been indoctrinated to think in terms of substance

01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:58.900
 and energy as different things.

01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:03.900
 Energy is what pushes matter around in space,

01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:10.380
 but it isn't a factual description of matter and energy.

01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:16.980
 The body we experience is a unitary process,

01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:23.540
 so the organs and tissues and cells

01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:28.540
 and conscious experience are really all one thing.

01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:31.100
 Substantial phenomenon.

01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:35.100
 - Great, sir.

01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:41.220
 - One substance in which energy is moving you as a whole,

01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:50.380
 you don't have to think about the way your life

01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:53.900
 is specifically working on cells and organs.

01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:56.700
 - Great, sir.

01:39:56.700 --> 01:40:00.140
 I have a question about routine versus interesting life.

01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:02.260
 So if you're doing something repetitive,

01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:04.700
 wouldn't that give a signal to the cells in the brain

01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:07.100
 that they don't need to produce as much energy

01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:08.820
 through oxidative phosphorylation

01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:12.180
 because it's the same thing every single time,

01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:14.020
 so eventually they're kind of like

01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:15.780
 traveling down their oxidative phosphorylation

01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:17.580
 and may get rid of it altogether

01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:20.480
 if all you're doing is the same thing over and over again?

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:26.580
 - Yeah, and you can't really do anything

01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:30.500
 twice, like Heraclitus said.

01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:35.060
 You're always changing, and if you're trapped

01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:41.100
 in that kind of a repetitive behavior,

01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:47.220
 you either have to escape or go to sleep,

01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:53.420
 and people tend to put themselves to sleep

01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:58.840
 rather than escaping from pointless work.

01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:04.380
 - So are you saying that the tendency to doze off

01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:06.460
 and fall asleep when you're doing something boring,

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:09.200
 that's basically a normal physiological reaction

01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:12.900
 to escape the energetic stress that this activity's causing?

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:13.880
 - I think so.

01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:16.700
 - Okay, that's very interesting.

01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:19.300
 Would it be therapeutic if somebody's stuck at a job?

01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:21.340
 I know the best thing is to leave, right?

01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:22.520
 But if somebody's stuck at a job

01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.980
 that they consider repetitive or routine

01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:27.740
 or generally unfulfilling, would it be therapeutic

01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:31.060
 to think, to remind ourselves of what Heraclitus said,

01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:32.740
 you may think that you're doing the exact same thing,

01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:33.620
 but it's really not.

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:36.380
 Every moment of your life is different

01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:38.780
 from one second to the other.

01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:43.780
 - Yeah, that's the process that should be happening.

01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:46.580
 - I have to say, when I worked at Apple Retail,

01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:49.300
 every moment seemed exactly the same, unfortunately,

01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:51.380
 Georgi, so I don't know about that.

01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:53.820
 Okay, awesome.

01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:55.140
 Two more here, and then we'll let you,

01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:56.700
 and I think Georgi has a question as well,

01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:58.620
 and then we'll let you go here, right?

01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:00.700
 Okay, this one's about a tortured dog.

01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:02.780
 They say, "My dog was brutally tortured

01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:04.980
 "before I adopted him, SRA,"

01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:08.620
 I think it's satanic ritualistic abuse, I believe.

01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:10.940
 "How can I help him reset this trauma

01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:12.980
 "and live a normal life?

01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:15.940
 "After two years, he is still unable to relax or play."

01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:23.380
 - I think lots of personal interaction

01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:28.820
 perceiving what he's experiencing

01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:35.460
 and giving him rubdowns and body pleasure,

01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:42.180
 good massages, rubbing his head and neck and ears a lot

01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:49.300
 while paying close attention,

01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:56.220
 and trying to draw out little bits of pleasure

01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:57.980
 that are there.

01:42:57.980 --> 01:43:02.100
 - Amazing, okay, we'll end with this last one.

01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:04.820
 I don't know if you even understand this one.

01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:07.580
 He says, "What are Ray's thoughts on planes of existence

01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:09.140
 "beyond our physical world,

01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:11.920
 "such as the etheric and astral planes,

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:16.520
 "and if possible, how would your definition of energy

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:18.500
 "coincide with the," this one,

01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:21.660
 "and if possible, how would your definition of energy

01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:24.340
 "coincide with this cosmological view?

01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:28.300
 "If pure energy is the primordial essence of creation,

01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:33.040
 "is it confined solely to the physical world

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.740
 "or does it emerge elsewhere?"

01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:39.020
 - I don't think there is any elsewhere,

01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:45.300
 and part of those categories derive

01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:50.300
 from thinking about matter as an inert substance.

01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:57.160
 If you have a very metaphysical idea

01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:00.620
 about what matter is, then you have to have

01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:05.140
 an idea of what animates matter,

01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:09.660
 and so you get involved in separate energy

01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:12.900
 and planes and so on,

01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:17.900
 but there are all different levels of subtle interactions.

01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:26.420
 It isn't just the powerful energy

01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:28.280
 that runs through us metabolically

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:31.660
 to maintain our structure,

01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:35.460
 but given that complex structure,

01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:41.700
 our sensitivities increase in proportion

01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:45.900
 to how well-structured we are,

01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:50.900
 and insects and probably dogs, for example,

01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:56.740
 can detect at a distance a single vibrating molecule.

01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:02.980
 For example, a pheromone molecule

01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:09.100
 can be at a distance and very spread out,

01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:14.100
 but the infrared oscillations emitted

01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:19.020
 by the molecule just sitting there

01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:24.020
 are strong enough to be sensed by insects,

01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:29.620
 so the environment is constantly

01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:33.100
 offering us information about itself,

01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:38.100
 and those levels of subtle energy interactions

01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:42.580
 depend on our sensitivity to them,

01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:47.140
 and by tuning in, you can find out

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:51.780
 that our world is full of lots of information

01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:55.540
 and messages that are ignored,

01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:58.540
 if you believe in inert matter

01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:02.580
 and separate energy and so on.

01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:07.120
 - Doesn't the idea of having a reality

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:09.380
 beyond this one ultimately lead

01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:11.140
 to either one of these two paradoxes,

01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:14.620
 either what the church calls creatio ex nihilo,

01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:17.020
 which is something was created out of nothing,

01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:19.140
 which to me is absurd,

01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:20.820
 or an infinite regression,

01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:24.300
 which they call reductio ad absurdum?

01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:26.140
 So as soon as you start talking

01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:28.060
 about a world beyond this world,

01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:32.580
 ultimately you'll end up with one of those two explanations,

01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:36.860
 and both of them to me sound absurd, sound senseless.

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:42.840
 - Yeah, I think that line of reasoning

01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:44.560
 is because we have been taught

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:49.100
 that a certain doctrine about reasoning,

01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:53.800
 of Rene Descartes,

01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:58.600
 idea of inert matter and consciousness,

01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:00.240
 activating it and so on,

01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:05.800
 putting dualism or worse

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:09.080
 into the very definitions that you're working with.

01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:15.000
 You have to start looking at language

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:20.200
 as something that you can work with.

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:23.400
 You don't have to accept what people tell you.

01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:27.440
 It is built into reality of language.

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:30.880
 - So if we had higher rates of metabolism

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.200
 and we paid attention more,

01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:35.460
 we could talk to Aphrodite the cat like you did?

01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:37.920
 - I think so.

01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:38.760
 (laughing)

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:43.760
 I think everyone is open to that sort of communication.

01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:50.080
 It's just that the animals are always willing

01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:58.040
 that people live in their dream world of word consciousness.

01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:01.560
 - Why do you think the second signal system evolved, Ray?

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:05.120
 I mean, it seems to be a largely pathological development

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:05.960
 in evolution.

01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:12.360
 - I think it has practicality to make remote things

01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:18.640
 something you can talk about

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:21.560
 rather than having to stay

01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:24.280
 with the surrounding immediate reality

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:29.280
 that animals and people can talk about.

01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:32.720
 - And maybe potentially pass down through the generations

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:35.200
 like abstract information.

01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:39.440
 - Yeah, remote in time or space.

01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:42.840
 - Okay, but invariably, if it gets pushed to the extreme,

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:44.800
 it becomes quickly pathological, right?

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:48.120
 Too much analytical thought, too much deductionism.

01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:51.320
 - Very easily pathological,

01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:55.360
 inferring people from about the age of five or six

01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:03.640
 participates in flowing mental perceptions.

01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:06.240
 - Is there an easy or at least quick way to gauge

01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:08.440
 in a particular society or country

01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:11.560
 like how much of each system is at play on average

01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:12.880
 in their population?

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:15.320
 I mean, some countries have the stereotype

01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:17.520
 of being extremely logical and analytical

01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:19.620
 and others being primitive brutes,

01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:21.420
 which to me is a euphemism for

01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:23.280
 they're probably first signal people.

01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:29.440
 - Yeah, I tried to do that when I was studying linguistics

01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:30.620
 60 years ago.

01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:36.560
 Tried to identify those traits of national identity

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:41.880
 and language differences.

01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:45.040
 - So is it something that can be gleaned through

01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:48.200
 from the language that a specific country

01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:49.840
 or group of people uses?

01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:51.280
 - I think so.

01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:58.600
 I think the countries that have lost their grammar

01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:04.640
 to some extent have opened up their ability

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.560
 to receive messages

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:14.440
 in a more realistic and biological way.

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:18.760
 - So you're saying cultures with fewer grammatical rules

01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:21.060
 in their language tend to be more open-minded?

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.460
 - I think so.

01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:28.460
 That was what I was starting my linguistics thesis on.

01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:34.680
 - There is a, in the economics world,

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:37.040
 they're saying that you can measure a country's freedom

01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:39.800
 by the amount, by the sheer number of laws

01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:40.920
 it has on the books.

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:44.160
 Do you think that's a good surrogate too?

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:47.000
 Basically the more laws, the less free a country is?

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:53.040
 - Yeah, that's a reflection of how many laws

01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:55.640
 are built into your language.

01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:58.840
 You don't have to have a written language,

01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:03.840
 but if you're, that helps to turn it into

01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:07.840
 a distracting concreteness.

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:12.840
 But if you have a language that is more fluid,

01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:21.600
 flexible, that lets you have better perceptions.

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:25.960
 - I'm gonna close the show, Georgie.

01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:27.740
 Do you have one more question?

01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:29.200
 - No, I'm fine.

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:32.400
 - Okay, rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:34.000

 You can email the same newsletter to buy all of Ray's books

01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:46.080
 in digital copy, and Ray also in,

01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:47.880
 can they get those in print as well?

01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:51.280
 - Some of them are still in print.

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:55.400
 - Amazing, and then Progest-E from Keenogen emailed Catherine

01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:57.440
 she just shipped me 12 bottles.

01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:58.920
 She packages it extremely,

01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:01.000
 now would you raise that film over the progesterone

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.060
 to protect it during the shipping process?

01:52:03.060 --> 01:52:09.240
 - Yeah, to keep out maybe even x-rays to some extent.

01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:11.740
 - That's what I figured, that's amazing that she does that.

01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:14.320
 Each bottle Progest-E contains 3,400 milligrams

01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:15.320
 of progesterone.

01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:18.360
 Ray, thank you so much, stay on the line.

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:19.900
 You know, we'll chat, we'll let you go,

01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:21.240
 but just thank you again.

01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:23.040
 We have an amazing listenership,

01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:26.800
 sincerely appreciate these things are so fun to do.

01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:28.320
 Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:29.800
 for being my partner in crime.

01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:31.580
 And again, thank you, Ray, for all your work

01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:33.720
 and everything you do, sincerely appreciate it.

01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:34.880
 Okay, everybody have a safe weekend.

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:35.720
 We'll talk to you guys soon.

01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:36.840
 Okay, peace out, bye.
