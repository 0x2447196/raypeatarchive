00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.280
 From 7 till 8 p.m. this evening and every third Friday of the month,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:19.080
 I produce the Ask Your Herb Doctor show and we are very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us every time it seems and thankfully so.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.680
 For those people who live in the area, there's a 707 number and for those people outside of the area,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:34.280
 there is an 800 number because it is a call-in show that we open the lines up from 7.30 until 8 o'clock

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.080
 with people invited to call in with questions either about the topic of this month's show

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:51.280
 or other topics that are related to some of Ray Peat's research or are just health-related questions in general.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:59.680
 So the number if you live in the area, if you're in the 707 area code, that's 707-923-3911.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.280
 If you're outside of the area, we do get people calling in from all time zones across the states

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.480
 and people in New York and Finland and other South American places even.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:19.680
 And the 800 number is 1-800-568-3723 for those people listening on the web,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.680
 especially the callers who are actually at 4 o'clock in the morning now.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.280
 Actually, I think that 800 number might not work from outside of California actually,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.880
 but almost certainly not internationally.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.080
 How do people call in from Finland?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.280
 I think he's just calling the 923 number like international calling.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.280
 Okay.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.080
 It's expensive, so I hope he's paying for it.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.880
 He's awake at the time, so I know we've got a pretty good hardcore.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.480
 An incredible wide range.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.280
 Yeah, of people listening to what Ray Peat has to say.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 Anyway, so this month we weren't here in February, but in January we did a show

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.880
 on the continuing misconceptions surrounding progesterone

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.680
 and the seemingly inexorable and continual promotion of estrogen by the drug industry

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.880
 and unfortunately by less informed medical care professionals

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.280
 who are bombarded with "research" into estrogen's benefits

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.080
 when actually the evidence fairly clearly shows that progesterone is in fact the protective hormone

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.480
 for which any woman either of menstruating age, if they are estrogen dominant

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.480
 or especially at menopausal times in their life from the late 30s for some women,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.080
 but mid 40s to 50s, progesterone is actually a very important hormone

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.080
 to maintain the anti-inflammatory arm,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.680
 whereas estrogen is the most inflammatory hormone

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.480
 that is continually secreted throughout a woman's life.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.480
 So in January's show then we discussed the PROTECT and SYNAPSE,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.080
 these are acronyms, PROTECT and SYNAPSE trials of progesterone's anti-inflammatory effects

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.480
 used in the treatment of traumatic brain injury

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.280
 and the paper was published in the Journal of Neurotrauma June 1st, 2017

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.080
 outlined several reasons the design was flawed and unsuccessful.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.080
 These were primarily due to suboptimal dosing and treatment durations in the Phase 2 studies,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.080
 secondly the strategic decision not to perform Phase 2B studies before initiating Phase 3

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.480
 and thirdly the lack of incorporation of preclinical and Chinese Phase 2 results

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.480
 as well as allometric scaling principles into the Phase 3 design.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:55.080
 It's also been inferred the 6% soybean oil forming the lipid emulsion

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.880
 into which progesterone was dissolved in its own right causes neurodegeneration.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.480
 Now Donald Stein, a 30-year PhD brain injury expert at Emory University

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.880
 was part of the team which published the paper in the Journal of Neurotrauma.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:23.480
 So pregnanolone and allopregnanolone are synthesized de novo by astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from cholesterol.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.880
 Now astrocytes are found within the central nervous system and perform a variety of functions

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:37.280
 and oligodendrocytes which form the support and insulation to axons are also in the CNS forming the myelin sheath.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:46.080
 Now pregnanolone and allopregnanolone are what they term positive allosteric modulators of the GABA-A receptor

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:55.080
 and demonstrate anxiolytic, sedative and anti-convulsant activities similar to the benzodiazepines like Valium.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.680
 Now this same GABA receptor is also acted on by valerian producing the same effects

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.280
 used for low mood disorders, anxiety and sleep disorders.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.680
 Now when progesterone levels decrease, GABA-A receptor activity also declines

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.080
 and contributes to the excitotoxic effects accompanying insomnia and agitation

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.880
 with energy being wasted and reserves depleted.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.080
 So once again we are very thankful to receive Ray Peat into the show.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.080
 Are you with us Dr. Peat?

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.880
 Yes.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.480
 Hi, thanks for joining us.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.080
 As always I'd like you to outline your academic and professional background

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.680
 just for people who perhaps have maybe never heard you before.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.480
 I'm PhD University of Oregon 1972.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:55.680
 I started studying biology there in 1968 and specialized in reproductive endocrine physiology.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.480
 I studied a few other things previously.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.280
 Okay, so notably I think I just want to mention for people I know you did a lot of research

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.080
 into aging and the negative effects of aging and what was understood with aging then

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:20.280
 because I think in terms of progesterone especially as an anti-quote-unquote anti-aging product,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.280
 this research was also at the time kind of a touchy subject

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.480
 because I think the estrogen industry even then was pretty dominant, wasn't it?

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:39.480
 Yes, interestingly Donald Stein was studying psychology there right around the same time I was there.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.280
 Okay, alright.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.880
 So my first question to you and this is something that I was just thinking about

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.680
 in terms of progesterone's protective effects

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:58.480
 because you've mentioned in the past how estrogen typically is associated with water logging of the cells

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.880
 and an excitotoxic state of the cell where energy is being wasted

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.480
 and I know you've mentioned a lot concerning substances like thyroid hormone and aspirin,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.880
 pregnenolone, progesterone that protect against that.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.880
 Do you think progesterone would be a useful substance in a heart attack if given soon enough?

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.680
 I know that hawthorn extract has been shown to reduce ischemia following heart attack

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.480
 if given within the first few hours of the event.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.680
 So do you think progesterone would be useful for a heart attack instance?

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:39.880
 Yes, in all sorts of crisis situations it lowers the damage

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.480
 that's done by the interruption of the oxidative processes.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:51.880
 It lowers inflammation and helps to restore energy production.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:08:01.880
 It's very parallel to the effects of T3, the active thyroid hormone

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:12.080
 and it helps to produce that and the T3 helps to increase the ratio of progesterone to estrogen

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.480
 and T3 is equally acutely protective to the heart.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.280
 Several years ago when they were doing heart transplants,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:30.680
 they found that if they gave the donor, the heart donor T3 before removing their heart,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.680
 that heart was much more successfully implanted.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:42.680
 So I can't help but thinking from an energy supportive functionality

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:49.080
 that maybe that's how thyroid is working in terms of stabilizing cells, energizing them

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.080
 and making them ready for work as it were as opposed to the depolarized,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:00.880
 you know, having spent its energy states that most substances like estrogen for example would promote.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:07.680
 Yeah, in the oligodendrocytes that you mentioned where progesterone is produced,

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:15.080
 T3 is the active thing that promotes its production there.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:21.480
 Interesting. Okay. So I wanted also to ask you that,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:29.480
 and again we've covered this in several radio shows in the past about the hoax of global warming

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:39.080
 and rising CO2 levels and all of the fanfare by Al Gore and others to levy a carbon tax

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:45.280
 on every single head on the earth to pay for the damage of our own success if you like,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:54.880
 or our own creativity. But we recognize that the early earth, if you look back at fossil records,

00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.280
 the early earth records showed that the earth had a massive lush vegetation

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:06.080
 and that CO2 levels were significantly higher than promoting this vegetation.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:13.880
 Would you, because I know you've mentioned in the past the similarities between carbon dioxide and progesterone.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:21.880
 So just to help people encompass that thought of how beneficial carbon dioxide really is

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.880
 and equate that to progesterone's protective effects.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:37.080
 One more comment on the relation between T3 and progesterone is that both of those increase the production

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:48.080
 and retention of carbon dioxide. And another point on giving progesterone to a recent heart attack,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:55.080
 the effect of estrogen on the energy production, which makes the heart able to beat.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:02.080
 Estrogen delays the restoration of the energy needed to make the heart beat.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:10.880
 And that shows up as prolonged QT interval. And progesterone shortens that interval,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:21.280
 makes the heart less likely to have a rhythm problem because it accelerates the ability to return to the resting,

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:28.080
 energized state where it can beat rather than having an arrhythmia event.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:35.280
 And carbon dioxide has that same muscle stabilizing effect.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:43.280
 At high altitude, for many years they've talked about the lactate paradox.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:58.280
 A person can work full force at high altitude without producing the excess lactic acid that they normally would produce at sea level.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:08.280
 And that's because the body at lower oxygen pressure is able to retain a higher balance of CO2 in the tissues.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:19.280
 And that stabilizing effect in the working muscle is very similar to what progesterone is doing in the heart and brain.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:28.280
 Okay, so this again probably lends some more credence to the data showing that people living at high altitudes have longer lifespans.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:45.280
 Yeah, and if you look at how sleep is affected under stress, when someone is having altitude sickness, they develop insomnia.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:54.280
 And it's primarily the low thyroid people who develop altitude sickness because they hyperventilate.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:59.280
 Rather, they were hyperventilating chemically even at sea level.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:09.280
 And when they go to high altitude, that hyperventilation or a low retention of CO2 shows up as an acute problem.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:20.280
 But at sea level or at high altitude, if your thyroid function is good and you're well saturated with carbon dioxide,

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:33.280
 your restful, slow-wave sleep, the deep part of sleep, is longer in proportion to the amount of CO2 in your tissues.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:45.280
 And they've experimented with having people sleep in atmospheres from one-half percent to one-and-a-half percent or even higher.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:54.280
 At those moderate but greatly increased CO2 levels, there's a dramatic improvement.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:06.280
 The slow-wave deep sleep is extended greatly in the around one percent CO2 where normally it's only about 400 parts per million.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.280
 And that's the regenerative part of sleep, isn't it?

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.280
 Yeah.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.280
 Okay, let me just hold you right there.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:19.280
 One little question for me first is, does that imply that when athletes are taking oxygen on the sidelines of the football game,

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:28.280
 they should have some carbon dioxide mixed in with that or just doping yourself with carbon dioxide in general would be a good athletic performance?

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:34.280
 Yeah, it should be five or six percent CO2 and fewer oxygen.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:47.280
 And on some of the Mount Everest experiments, it was traditional to have a plastic or rubber bag to zip the person up inside the bag with oxygen

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:53.280
 at the high altitude to help them recover if they were becoming mountain sick.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:01.280
 And someone found that what happened in that plastic bag was they concentrated their breath, CO2 increased,

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:16.280
 and they found that giving the high altitude sickness patient pure CO2, like a five percent additive, would cure them as well as the oxygen supplement.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.280
 Okay, let me hold you there for a moment, Dr. Peat, because the lights did flash about five minutes ago,

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.280
 and I was kind of holding off just to get a little bit further down the road here.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.280
 But let's take this first call and see where this call is going.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.280
 Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.280
 Hello, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.280
 Yes. Hello?

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.280
 Hi. Where are you from? What's your question?

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:44.280
 Yes. Hi. I'm from Southern California. I have a question for Dr. Peat.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.280
 Go ahead. Yes, go ahead.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:53.280
 Hi, Dr. Peat. Thank you so much. Thank you for all your contributions to humanity. Thank you.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:16:05.280
 I would like a question about, I have a sibling who has a history of infertility and has had very high prolactin levels,

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:13.280
 and she cannot bring it down with Westroid, thyroid, two grains a day, or progestin.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:23.280
 And she follows your diet very carefully. What else can she do for her prolactin to bring it down?

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:30.280
 Has she taken her temperature and pulse rate to see how she's responding to the thyroid?

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.280
 Yes, she does that very well. She does all of that.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.280
 So you think it's a thyroid medication that's not working for her, the two grains of Westroid?

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:46.280
 Yes. It's really important to look at your various indicators.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.280
 For example, the Achilles relaxation reflex.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:59.280
 If you kneel, let your toes hang down, have someone thump your Achilles tendon so that your toe jumps out,

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:06.280
 it should relax just like a piece of floppy rubber if your thyroid is good.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:12.280
 About two-thirds of the population, it comes back like it has a door closer on it,

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:19.280
 meaning that if it was in your heart, it would be a prolonged QT interval.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:27.280
 It shows up as a delayed repolarization or relaxation of the muscle when your thyroid is low.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:34.280
 I found it pretty commonly that what you think is going to be a sufficient dose for someone,

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:40.280
 they start using it and actually have to increase it quite a bit more than they were using just to get the effect.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.280
 Some people are just very stubborn. No one is alike.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:50.280
 I know you've mentioned a lot with temperature and pulses as a diagnostic indicator of someone's metabolism, Dr. Peat.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:57.280
 You've also mentioned just a minute ago the Achilles tendon reflex and what you call the repolarization,

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:07.280
 that very quick flick out but the slow return to normal, that's indicative of the cell's stressed state where it's not repolarizing quick enough.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.280
 That is a sure sign of hypothyroidism.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:19.280
 For the lady who is just listening to that, if you basically kneel on a chair and have your feet extended behind you

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:27.280
 and then someone can tap your Achilles tendon and see the reflex response there.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.280
 Was there anything else that you think might be responsible for the hyperlactin

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:38.280
 or do you think it's pretty much something that could be corrected with thyroid hormone given enough?

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:44.280
 Isn't it a tumor growth or anything like that that could be causing it?

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:54.280
 If there's really a tumor that's secreting it, bromocriptine is almost always successful at shrinking it.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:19:07.280
 But if the tumor isn't very large, you can, I think, just as reliably do it by keeping your thyroid function a little above normal

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:18.280
 for two or three weeks and watch the prolactin as you first should see the TSH go down close to zero

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:27.280
 because the same serotonin which rises in hypothyroidism activates the production of prolactin.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:37.280
 So the TSH descent will be followed by a slower lowering of the prolactin.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.280
 Okay.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.280
 I have two more questions.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:52.280
 She wanted to know how you cook and safely cook and eat your mushrooms and also your marmalade.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.280
 It's just having difficulty making those two.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.280
 What was the first thing?

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.280
 Mushrooms.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.280
 I guess for the anti-aromatase activity.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:11.280
 Oh, yeah, I think it's safe to eat about a cup of well-cooked white button mushrooms every day.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.280
 And then I think the lady was asking how to prepare them, but you would just...

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.280
 Just boil them.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.280
 Yeah, okay, you boil them.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.280
 Okay, how about frying them in butter?

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.280
 That tastes good too.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.280
 They should stay at the boiling temperature for at least an hour.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:32.280
 I know when my wife does it, she does cook them for at least 40 minutes, but you think about an hour, don't I?

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.280
 I think so.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.280
 Okay.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.280
 They're probably safe after even 15 or 20 minutes, but just to be sure.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.280
 She was just talking about it tonight.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:45.280
 She was just saying how you'd mentioned that raw mushrooms have cancer-promoting substances in them,

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:52.280
 but that the paradox was that well-cooked mushrooms had that anti-aromatase blocking activity.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:59.280
 Yeah, and with marmalade, it's important to get good organic oranges.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:05.280
 You don't want any insecticide or fungicide in your marmalade.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.280
 You either use the seed or you don't, the orange.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.280
 You just said you need to make sure you've got a certified product because any residues will be in the skin,

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.280
 and that's where you're going to be making your marmalade.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.280
 But not the pith of the orange, correct?

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.280
 No.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.280
 No pith. Okay. Just making sure.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.280
 Thank you so much. I really appreciate everything.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.280
 You're welcome. We do have two more callers.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:33.280
 I know some people do use a pith, but we never did, and you're making it with good navel oranges that are ripe and ready.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.280
 Right now, folks, if you want to make your marmalade, they're all there.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.280
 They won't be around for long, a very short harvest for navels.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.280
 Anyway, we've got two more callers, so let's take this first call away from them.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.280
 Where are you from and what's your question?

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.280
 Hi. I'm calling from Finland.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.280
 Okay. I was just talking to them.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:56.280
 How did you call in? Do you call a regular 707-923-3911 number or?

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.280
 That's correct.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.280
 Okay. There you go. All right. Well, good for you.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.280
 It works fine.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.280
 Go ahead.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:12.280
 Yeah. I was wondering about the potential positive but perhaps also negative effects of donating blood for the donor.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:21.280
 I was wondering if, for example, this might help get rid of perhaps metals,

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:38.280
 and I was also wondering about could the longer lifespan of a female be linked to the fact that they are basically getting rid of blood for the life every month.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.280
 Yeah. Well, from an iron perspective, definitely good to donate blood to lower your iron.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:46.280
 But Dr. Peat, what would you have to say about donating blood?

00:22:46.280 --> 00:23:00.280
 Yeah. As far as heart disease goes, the incidence of heart damage of different types increases at menopause

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:06.280
 so that women become similar to men for the high rate of heart damage,

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:16.280
 and that's probably because they have been throwing away some excess iron while they were menstruating.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:30.280
 Besides the red cell iron that you lose, I think you can get a great benefit if you aren't eating too much iron.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:38.280
 If you keep your red cells but donate the plasma, it might not be good for the recipient,

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:46.280
 but it's very good to get rid of some of your stress-induced microspheres.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:52.280
 There you go. That's another way. Did you get that?

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.280
 Absolutely. Thank you very much.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:59.280
 And again, you're doing a lot of good to a lot of people. Thank you for that.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.280
 What time is it quickly in Finland again?

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:10.280
 It's between 4 and 5 a.m. and the temperatures are, I believe, around 7 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.280
 7 Fahrenheit. It's pretty cold.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.280
 Negative Celsius.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.280
 Okay. Well, hopefully you're keeping your vitamin D levels up.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.280
 Could we use you as a Finnish correspondent sometime?

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.280
 Absolutely.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.280
 Okay. Hang on for a second. We've got another caller for the show right now.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.280
 We have at least two more.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:30.280
 So let's take this next caller. And then, caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.280
 New Jersey. My name is Joe.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.280
 Hey, Joe. Thanks for calling. What's your question?

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.280
 First one in the context of CO2.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:46.280
 I guess progesterone, sugar, and other things will help, plus thyroid hormone will increase CO2 just by diet.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:52.280
 But you've also mentioned in the past about CO2 sort of cartridge,

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.280
 taking that CO2 gas and putting it in a bag and putting it in your body.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.280
 Is that sort of a distressed application?

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:09.280
 Or if your body is -- your cells are smart, if you use that bag of CO2 on a regular basis,

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:15.280
 would your body acclimate to it and actually get better at retaining CO2

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.280
 because it would essentially -- the cells would be memorizing it.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.280
 And I'm sorry, I'm not a philosopher for simplicity's sake.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:28.280
 Obviously, I'm butchering it. But is that -- or is that more a one-off situation?

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.280
 No, I think that's exactly what happens.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:40.280
 You're training your cells to take advantage of the lactate paradox effect.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:50.280
 The longer you stay under the influence of higher CO2, your bones are charging up on it.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:55.280
 If you're in a submarine, for example, for two months,

00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:01.280
 you are still assimilating CO2 into your bone structure.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:07.280
 And so it lasts a long time after you're at high altitude or in a submarine.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.280
 Okay, so you're saying that what I'm saying, it makes sense.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.280
 So if you actually did that, you are teaching your body,

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:19.280
 and that would be a pretty powerful way to supplement the normal --

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.280
 I mean, if you're taking a little bit of progesterone as a man, I guess that's okay --

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.280
 but normal thyroid, you know, salt and sugar,

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:32.280
 and things that actually increase your thermogenesis and your CO2 retention.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.280
 Is that accurate?

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:40.280
 Yeah, you're training some parts of your brain not to be hypersensitive to CO2.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:45.280
 Estrogen makes your nerves overreactive to CO2.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:54.280
 So under the influence of too much estrogen, everyone hyperventilates and blows out too much CO2.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:27:00.280
 And the CO2 temporarily sort of anesthetizes that process

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.280
 and gradually trains you to stop hyperventilating.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.280
 Okay, great.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.280
 I'm glad -- I've been reading a lot of your stuff,

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.280
 and as I read it, these thoughts come to me, and that's never been discussed.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.280
 That's a really good thing to know.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.280
 How long would you have to do it?

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.280
 I mean, if you did it for -- it's like you --

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:24.280
 I think another person, maybe one of the moderators,

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:31.280
 said that she went to one of the mountains in Mexico,

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:36.280
 and you said the health benefit lasts for -- if you're there for two -- a week,

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.280
 it lasts for a long time afterwards.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:46.280
 That's essentially another way of saying what you're saying, the body gets used to the CO2.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:52.280
 Some of the Russian studies where they took animals up for six months,

00:27:52.280 --> 00:28:00.280
 they were still showing the greater mitochondrial efficiency at the end of their lives two years later.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.280
 Wow.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.280
 Okay, the second question -- thank you for that -- the second question relates to the most --

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:09.280
 this whole notion that Amanda's brought up on toxic metals.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.280
 So there's hair tests that you can get,

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.280
 and this has actually never come up on any of these shows or even in your writings,

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:19.280
 where you can actually measure the amount of metal, toxic metals,

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:28.280
 and preferred minerals in your hair because, unlike the blood, it's -- the hair's dead,

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:33.280
 but there's no reason not to give you a relatively accurate reading of what your toxic metals are.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:39.280
 One of the toughest ones, it seems to me, is the concept of balancing copper and iron.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.280
 And I know you've mentioned if you eat with your meat, you eat -- you have coffee.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.280
 But I think that only gets rid of the heme iron.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.280
 I don't think there's any way to get rid of the non-heme iron.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:54.280
 So I'm wondering, as you get older -- I know you'll probably consider yourself older after you get over 100,

00:28:54.280 --> 00:29:01.280
 but for other people, iron-copper balance gets really challenging over time,

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.280
 particularly if you lose the CCO enzyme.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:10.280
 So what is it that you can do, aside from giving -- giving blood is stressful in the body, too.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:15.280
 So I didn't actually understand your answer to the last gentleman, but it's not just iron,

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:22.280
 and it's not just copper, but copper, iron, and manganese apparently are very complex in the body,

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.280
 and toxic forms of that can really create havoc.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.280
 And you really haven't touched on that.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.280
 Do you believe in hair tests, in summary?

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:35.280
 And what's your view on how to balance the copper, iron --

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:46.280
 Hair is extremely able to bind even out of the air, but so many people have copper plumbing nowadays.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:52.280
 If your water is at all acidic, it will absorb enough copper out of your plumbing

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:58.280
 to totally invalidate any hair test if you wash your hair,

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:10.280
 because your hair will catch all of the copper to saturate it just out of the wash water.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.280
 Interesting.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:17.280
 Okay, so you're saying hair tests, by definition, are generally not valid because they --

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:23.280
 Yeah, toenail clippings are considered better, but even your toenails can soak up,

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:28.280
 if you wash your feet too often, they can soak up minerals out of the water,

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.280
 especially copper from the plumbing.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.280
 Well, how do you get rid of toxic metals, and how do you balance copper and iron over time?

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.280
 Because apparently you're supposed to lose your copper as you get older,

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.280
 and as you mentioned, both men and women retain more iron.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.280
 Men may be earlier.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.280
 That's essentially probably why they die earlier, generally speaking.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:53.280
 That's why I advocate eating shellfish, because they use copper for blood instead of iron.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:31:02.280
 And a constant once a week shellfish will, I think, keep your copper up where it should be.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.280
 Do you agree there's a balance between the two? Are they fighting for --

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:15.280
 Yeah, with age, as you overload on iron, that tends to displace copper from the enzymes,

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:23.280
 where it's used elastase in blood vessels, tends to deteriorate as it loses copper with aging,

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.280
 and the pigment is displaced.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:34.280
 Karl Pfeiffer, who was big on the fear of copper, took a little sulfur every day,

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:39.280
 because he knew it would reduce the absorption of copper.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:47.280
 But when I met him, he was in his 70s, and he had no trace of pigment anywhere.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:52.280
 His skin was absolutely pink, and his hair was pure white.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:32:00.280
 I think that was because of creating a deficiency of copper by too much sulfur.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.280
 Interesting.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.280
 The last question -- I'm sorry, one other -- so I saw an article,

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.280
 and it talked about all these health people, Adele Davis, who you've referenced, many others,

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:12.280
 Jim Fix, all these people were the rage, right?

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.280
 And they're all dead, like, before 70.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:20.280
 You're probably going to be 120 before you consider yourself a senior citizen.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:25.280
 But I don't think there's anyone who is -- well, there's no one as expert as you are,

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:31.280
 but also who understands it fundamentally, because it appears that you define the age, you know, too.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.280
 A lot of the people that you've studied didn't make it that long,

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:40.280
 so they clearly didn't fully understand it, or it's possible that you just got lucky genes.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.280
 I don't know.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.280
 Adele Davis, I think she lived to about 80,

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:51.280
 but she was totally misinformed on the polyunsaturated fat issue.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:57.280
 I think she included it in her tiger milk recipe, for example.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.280
 Okay.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.280
 We do have two more callers, so let's give these callers a chance.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.280
 Thanks for your call.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.280
 Okay, next caller, you're on the air.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.280
 And where are you from?

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.280
 What's your question?

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.280
 Hello.

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.280
 I'm from Blue Lake.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.280
 I'm a member, and thanks for your show.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.280
 Hi, Dr. Peat, Dr. Murray.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:19.280
 I have always had high estrogen my entire life to where I'm 59 now.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.280
 I stopped menstruating at 55.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:30.280
 I was high estrogen to the point that I had the brown blemishes on my cheeks

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:40.280
 and bursted cysts throughout the entire time of my, like, 8 or 10, which are incredible.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:47.280
 So you were saying about the correlation between high estrogen and inflammation.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:54.280
 I haven't been able to listen to the show for a long time, and I'm wanting to know.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:34:01.280
 Now I have Lyme issues and I have Candida issues and things,

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:08.280
 and I'm wondering, I've heard that Reishi can help with this, help counteract this estrogen.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.280
 I mean, now it seems lower since I've reached menopause.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:20.280
 I think I have a better sex drive than I've had in the last 25 years, which is very strange.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:25.280
 And I just am wondering if Reishi can still help.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.280
 I'm still having these inflammation issues.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.280
 Okay.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.280
 All right.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:35.280
 Well, let me just quickly say, first of all, progesterone is the counterpart to estrogen dominance

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.280
 or any estrogen issues you would have had in inflammation.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.280
 Dr. Peat, I wanted to ask you, you've always, because when I was studying,

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.280
 it was always that testosterone was the drive, you know, for males,

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.280
 and it was the thing that was responsible for virility.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:54.280
 And you're actually saying that estrogen is very responsible, more responsible for sex drive.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:58.280
 And there's this lady, and she's just called in now saying her sex drive is better than ever.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.280
 What do you think?

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.280
 Very strange.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:05.280
 Dr. Peat, what do you think about estrogen in relation to sexuality?

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:17.280
 It just takes the conversion of any androgen to estrogen in certain parts of the brain to increase the libido.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.280
 So it doesn't have to be in your serum.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.280
 Right.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.280
 I see.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.280
 Okay.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.280
 So it's a conversion of an androgen.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.280
 Okay.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.280
 Well, the Reishi mushroom, I've heard, is good for inflammation.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.280
 And these things, this inflammation issues with the lines and different things,

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:39.280
 and I'm not sure if I'm fighting it well, but do you think Reishi is a good thing,

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:44.280
 or are the button mushrooms, like you said, I know they should be all cooked.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:50.280
 I think, and again, it's a little bit of a re-education exercise here.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:59.280
 In terms of the actuality of Lyme's, I have known people that do respond to ELISA tests

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.280
 with very strong positive banding.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:11.280
 But Dr. Peat, you're not that convinced about Lyme per se as opposed to low thyroid issues

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:17.280
 and other inflammatory processes that could be borne out by low thyroid that actually respond well.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:27.280
 Your body will go into a chronic inflammatory state in reaction to the Lyme bacteria.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.280
 Yes, I've had the ELISA test.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.280
 Candida and so on.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:42.280
 If you get your resistance up and your, for example, DHEA, pregnenolone, and progesterone

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:51.280
 will favor the right conversion of just the right amount of estrogen, not too much.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:58.280
 And you can boost that regulatory effect if you still have too much general estrogen

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:06.280
 with things like the mushrooms, aspirin.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:16.280
 What did you say you said, DHEA and something else, and then progesterone in a well-moderated dose?

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.280
 Pregnenolone.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.280
 Pregnenolone.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.280
 Okay.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.280
 I have one more question, sir.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:30.280
 With iron, you were speaking of iron and how too much iron for even women, and I've never known that,

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:36.280
 and I haven't been able to hear enough of your talks on this show to know what you meant about iron

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.280
 not being great for us.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:45.280
 But I've been told my whole life that I'm iron deficient, and I've tried to correct it naturally

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:51.280
 with molasses, blackstrap molasses, and cider vinegar and things like that,

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.280
 and I'm wondering if I'm on the right track with that.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:04.280
 Doctors for at least 100 years have been diagnosing iron deficiency in women.

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:08.280
 A hundred years ago they were prescribing arsenic to three women,

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:16.280
 but either arsenic or iron supplements do stimulate the production of red blood cells

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:23.280
 because the red cell production depends on stress,

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:32.280
 and you create a local oxygen deficiency with arsenic or iron, and so it can increase the formation.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:45.280
 But the problem is usually that your long bones, arms and legs, the temperature of your extremities goes down

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:51.280
 as your thyroid function decreases or your estrogen increases.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:39:01.280
 So high estrogen always tends to cause slight anemia appearance just by slowing the production of red blood cells.

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.280
 That makes sense.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.280
 So I also have high lead content in my blood.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:11.280
 I got a chemical test and I have lead.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:19.280
 Drinking milk, orange juice and coffee will correct that over a period of weeks.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.280
 Okay.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.280
 Thank you so much, sir.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.280
 Okay, you're welcome.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.280
 Okay, we still have another caller on the line.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.280
 Let me just say this quickly before that caller gets on.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:38.280
 The number if you're in the area is 707-923-3911 or the 800 number is 1-800-568-3723.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.280
 Dr. Peat, we're very lucky to have him on the show.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:44.280
 So go ahead, caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.280
 I'm James. I'm from the Southwest.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:53.280
 My question was how come I'm boarding for like an hour or better?

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.280
 What was to say again?

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.280
 I didn't actually--just tell me where you're from again and what was your question again?

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:06.280
 I'm from Sodor Cove and I was just curious on the why boarding the mushrooms for an hour or so.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.280
 Right, right.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:12.280
 Okay, he's wondering why you should cook mushrooms for an hour in order to get that activity that you've mentioned

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:18.280
 or we've mentioned in previous shows about the aromatase blocking activity.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:23.280
 The hydrazines are heat sensitive.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:33.280
 It's believed that the hydrazine compounds are the carcinogens and they evaporate and break down

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:41.280
 and around an hour will drastically lower the concentration.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:51.280
 Longer would be better, but I think it's completely safe because it's a balance between the

00:40:51.280 --> 00:41:06.280
 pro-carcinogenic hydrazines and the anti-cancer agents which are multiple such as lowering the aromatase function.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.280
 Thank you very much.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.280
 Okay, you're welcome.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.280
 Okay, so we have another caller.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.280
 So caller, you're on the air.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.280
 Where are you from and what's your question?

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.280
 Is it me?

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.280
 Yes, where are you from?

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.280
 What's your question?

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.280
 Okay, I'm from Virginia.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.280
 Virginia.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:30.280
 My question is relating to ornithine.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.280
 What was that?

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.280
 I didn't catch that.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.280
 I'm not sure Dr. Peate would have--

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:40.280
 Ornithine, it's an amino acid and I believe that it helps remove ammonia

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:50.280
 and I know that Dr. Peate has mentioned in the past about potato juice being boiled

00:41:50.280 --> 00:42:00.280
 and that helping to use the ammonia to make amino acids for the body,

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:04.280
 but what about at night if you're having trouble sleeping,

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:11.280
 taking a little bit of ornithine to mop up what is typically excess ammonia in everybody's body?

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.280
 Is that reasonable?

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:23.280
 It might help with the ammonia, but I would worry about the promotion of cell division

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.280
 if you used it clinically.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.280
 It's one of the things that activate cell division.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.280
 I see.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:39.280
 So which amino acids--I know you're not--

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:51.280
 Well, it's the keto acid equivalent of the essential amino acids that the keto group is

00:42:51.280 --> 00:43:00.280
 substituted with the ammonia, so they turn into real amino acids rather than keto acids.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.280
 I see.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.280
 Okay, so then you're saying that's not a good idea.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.280
 What about L-threonine?

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.280
 It's the only other amino acid that I was thinking about.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.280
 That one I've read on some of your blogs that--

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:19.280
 blogs, not that you've written--that threonine is helpful for preventing cancer

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.280
 and maybe helping metabolism.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:29.280
 I don't think it's very safe to use individual amino acids.

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:38.280
 Glycine is the only one I know of that is safe by itself because it can be used as energy.

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.280
 One other question.

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:44.280
 I think earlier on the show you were talking about insomnia,

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:50.280
 and I think it happens to me sometimes and other people,

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:55.280
 and if you get up in the middle of the night, it's no fun because it's hard to know what to do.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.280
 I know I've heard some of your suggestions,

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:04.280
 but if it's endotoxin-related, there's a product called monolaurin.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.280
 I don't know if you've written about it, but it's related to coconut,

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.280
 and you just mentioned Lyme disease.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.280
 Apparently people think that that is useful for that.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.280
 Is that safe to take?

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:25.280
 Is that useful instead of carrots periodically to sort of readjust your intestinal flora in a positive way?

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:32.280
 It does have a good effect killing a lot of fungi and bacteria,

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:39.280
 but several years ago when the guy was promoting its development, I forget his name,

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:44.280
 but he asked me to sign on to advertise it,

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:54.280
 and I asked him if he had done any tests to see if it didn't have an action-like soap on the intestine.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:45:04.280
 It is an emulsifier, and in a large dose I think it could be irritating to the intestine,

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:14.280
 but he didn't have any opinion on that, so I didn't participate.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:19.280
 So is your view that periodically that could be useful from time to time but not on a regular basis,

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.280
 or don't do it ever like ornithine?

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.280
 I would just be cautious.

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:34.280
 Like MCT, the part of the coconut oil that is more liquid,

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:42.280
 just a small amount of that can cause intestinal irritation and diarrhea in quite a few people.

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.280
 Okay, so you're saying that's the highest risk side effect.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.280
 If you don't get that, then maybe the intended effect is positive.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.280
 Yeah, it's probably not doing any harm.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.280
 Okay, so one is completely unrelated.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:57.280
 My question, you talk about not eating too much muscle meat, right?

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:05.280
 And I think you've made comments that in the past, you know, people used to eat the heart, the brain,

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:12.280
 you know, the kidneys, everything, but now liver is something that's a clean organ, and you can eat that.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:17.280
 What if you were able to get from clean animals?

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:26.280
 Desiccated heart, brain, but periodically it's not as good as the actual organ, maybe not as clean,

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:32.280
 but if it's from a grass-fed animal and you get a little bit from all the different organs,

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.280
 would that have some rejuvenatory effect or not?

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:44.280
 For example, the brain has a very high concentration of progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone.

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.280
 In a man or a woman?

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:51.280
 Yeah, it's like taking a supplement of those steroids.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:56.280
 Oh, you're saying if you did all that, you're saying that would be the equivalent of taking a supplement of those hormones?

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.280
 Yeah, eating the brain.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:04.280
 I knew someone who was Norwegian.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:12.280
 She said that in her coastal villages, everyone ate fish head soup at least once a week,

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:22.280
 and she said that everyone that she knew lived to be 95 if they were eating their fish head soup.

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:27.280
 I know you've always advocated the whole animal, I think way more than meat,

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:31.280
 when we first started finding out about you and working with you,

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:39.280
 and you've always said that things like bone broths are now the biggest thing on the supplement shelf,

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.280
 and I think they have been for about a year ago when I first saw them.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:49.280
 But anyway, things like bone broths and knuckle broths and lamb shanks are gelatin-rich,

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:55.280
 and it's the wide range of amino acids, not just the muscle meat that's the actual beneficial effect

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.280
 or beneficial part of the proteins that we get from it,

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:02.280
 and way more balanced and less inflammatory than muscle meats.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:08.280
 So does that mean the answer is that if you could get a grass-fed desiccated product

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:13.280
 that had a lot of the different organs in them that it may be beneficial,

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:17.280
 even though desiccated powder form is not ideal, but if it's the only way you can get it

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:22.280
 and you're relatively sure that it's what the product says it is,

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:26.280
 presumably that would be beneficial?

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:31.280
 I would worry about the dehydration process.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:42.280
 The fatty acids and the tryptophan and cysteine are very sensitive to oxidation,

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:46.280
 and they can break down into a lot of toxins.

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:53.280
 So you would have to be sure that it was dehydrated under nitrogen.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.280
 It just seems like a risk.

00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:00.280
 And that's why you're always advocating good quality food as your source of nutrition,

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.280
 because it's alive and hasn't been processed.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:11.280
 Eggs, for example, have lots of extremely beneficial substances.

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:17.280
 Some of them are just being discovered, and they're always fresh.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.280
 No one eats a snail egg.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.280
 Good point.

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.280
 Okay, we better hold it there.

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.280
 I've got a few things I wanted to ask Dr. Peat myself.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.280
 Thanks for your call.

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:32.280
 Dr. Peat, okay, it's already eight minutes to eight,

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:36.280
 and I think we've got callers from 7.15 at the outset.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:41.280
 I've hardly got through anything compared to what I was going to ask you about,

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.280
 and I guess we're going to have to do it next month.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:51.280
 But I think I wanted just to ask you about a catamenial.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:57.280
 I never even actually heard the phrase, but catamenial epilepsy and the estrogens.

00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:06.280
 And I was reading about the classes of estrogens and how these both estrone, estriol, and estradiol,

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:14.280
 how they trigger epilepsy, because I've actually had a couple of female epilepsy patients

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:18.280
 that really responded very well to thyroid and progesterone.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:22.280
 Have you come across catamenial?

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:30.280
 Okay, what's your experience?

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:38.280
 Katharina Dalton was one of the early people working on that.

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:45.280
 In the 1940s, she started treating premenstrual syndrome with progesterone,

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:56.280
 and there isn't a terrible difference between catamenial epilepsy and PMS.

00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:02.280
 One of the first people--maybe it was the very first person I ever--

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:10.280
 no, the second person I gave progesterone to was someone who had migraines when she was in her 30s,

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:17.280
 and she was a schoolteacher, and a doctor said, "Migraines are like epilepsy,"

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:27.280
 and so he prescribed an epileptic treatment, which she said had made her too stupid to tease.

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:34.280
 So when the fall term came, she stopped it and had an epileptic seizure,

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:40.280
 and the doctor said, "See, I told you her migraine was right next to epilepsy."

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:48.280
 But anyway, she kept having seizures until she was in her early 50s when I saw her,

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:53.280
 and every year the urologist would give her an IQ test and say,

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:59.280
 "Now your IQ has deteriorated to the point that you're an idiot.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.280
 Don't go out of the house alone."

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:11.280
 And her son brought her to talk to me, and I showed her how progesterone can be absorbed through the skin,

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.280
 and she had two stiff arthritic fingers.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:24.280
 She dipped it in the solution of progesterone, and I gave her some to take home and a chart to fill out,

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:34.280
 and a few days later she came back all by herself with her chart filled out showing that her symptoms had all disappeared,

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.280
 and she was grinning and bending her fingers.

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:48.280
 And within a few months she went back to graduate school and got straight A's, got a master's degree in gerontology.

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.280
 Wow. Gerontology.

00:52:51.280 --> 00:53:02.280
 The psychologist, urologist was right that epilepsy is closely related to PMS at least.

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:12.280
 She was simply having a premenstrual migraine, and sometimes that fades over into epilepsy.

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:19.280
 Well, let me hold you there, and I'll just finish up with the last few minutes to let people know more about you.

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:23.280
 Thanks so much for joining us, and we'll definitely carry this on next month if you're available.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.280
 Okay.

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:30.280
 Okay. I wanted to let people know that Dr. Peat's website is raypeat.com,

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:40.280
 and that website is full of articles related to things like thyroid and aspirin, cascara, progesterone,

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:48.280
 the things about Alzheimer's and cancer and iron's toxicity, and lots of articles fully referenced.

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:55.280
 Basically, almost close to peer-reviewed articles because of the work that's gone into them.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:05.280
 But Dr. Peat's a rather controversial figure, unfortunately, because a lot of what he says flies against the medical establishment in terms of their indoctrination.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:13.280
 But like anything else, you know, science is such a positive thing because it's reproducible,

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:23.280
 and you can't pull the wool over science's eyes, really, a true science, you know, that is objective and empirical and reproducible.

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:29.280
 So as time goes on, a lot of what we've been told was good for us has been shown to be bad for us,

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:33.280
 and those things that were bad for us are shown to be good for us.

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:49.280
 And a lot of the times it's a kind of corrupt process of either drug manufacture or just downright criminal behavior on behalf of some of these huge corporations like the fish oil people.

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:52.280
 But anyway, so his website is raypeat.com.

00:54:52.280 --> 00:55:08.280
 And next month I will finish off the progesterone versus estrogen data with a few other questions I had for him and a discourse by a Swedish PhD who's a specialist in female reproductive hormones

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:18.280
 who just goes on and on and on about how positive estrogen is for you, quoting all these bizarre statements that I know Dr. Peat's going to have some fun debunking.

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:29.280
 But just to show that it's a deeply entrenched belief, and I remember him saying, "A lie gets around the world faster than truth can get its shoelaces tied."

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:35.280
 So just be aware, people. The Internet's an excellent resource for all sorts of things, but it is mixed with good and bad.

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:39.280
 But anyway, pure science for science's sake can be found.

00:55:39.280 --> 00:56:03.280
 And again, the last thing that we'll do after we finish up with the progesterone and estrogen is do a little expose on positive thinking and quantum research's bystander effect now showing that the observer has an effect on the experiment without actually doing anything.

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:08.280
 It's just quantum science is coming of age and the Internet is the age of knowledge.

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:14.280
 And I think more than ever, we are ready to receive what we're getting now.

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:18.280
 And so a lot of the old dogmas are just fading away, fortunately.

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.280
 We really are coming into an age of enlightenment.

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:27.280
 So for all of those who asked questions this evening, thanks for tuning in and firing Dr. Peat up.

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:33.280
 And the same time, third Friday of next month from 7 to late, I'll be back.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:40.280
 And wow, we've now gone forward an hour. So for whatever that means, it means we just open our eyes at the same time.

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:42.280
 But the clock tells us the time's different.

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.280
 Anyway, thanks for those calling.

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:51.280
 And if you want to find out any information about myself, westernbotanicalmedicine.com is our website.

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.280
 Yeah. Thanks so much for listening.

00:56:55.280 --> 00:57:04.280
 Fish heads, fish heads, roly poly fish heads, fish heads, fish heads, eat them up, yum.
