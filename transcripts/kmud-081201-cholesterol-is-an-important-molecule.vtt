00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Good evening and welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KNUD 91.1 FM.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 For those of you perhaps who've never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8pm,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists with a degree in herbal medicine,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 and we consult and see a wide range of clients with a wide range of different conditions,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 and we also have a certified organic medicinal herb farm that produces the herbs for the tinctures and extracts that we also manufacture.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Well, this month, again, we are pleased to have Dr. Ray Peat on the show,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 and for those of you perhaps who've never heard of Dr. Peat,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 as I'm sure very often people tune into the show having perhaps never heard it,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 he will explain who he is and his background.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Welcome, Dr. Peat, to this month's show.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Hello, Dr. Peat?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Yes, hello.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Hi, welcome to December's Ask Your Herb Doctor show.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Thanks.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Now, I don't want to presume that everyone who has just tuned in to tonight's show knows your background, Dr. Peat,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 so I would appreciate it if you would give our listeners an overview of your professional and research-based work

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 before we open up tonight's topics.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Okay. I did my Ph.D. research in aging of the oxidative respiratory systems

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 and how that's affected mostly by the reproductive hormones

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 and how it causes, for example, the middle-aged infertility in people and animals.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 What I found that was contrary to the textbooks of the time was that estrogen became the dominant hormone at middle age,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 causing distortion of the oxidative metabolic processes,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 and that then got me interested in the factors that contribute to that age-related imbalance.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Age pigment was one of the things I studied in connection with that change.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 The age pigment itself is stimulated by an excess of estrogen,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 and it's formed mostly from polyunsaturated oils,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 and it oxidizes fuel and consumes oxygen without producing anything useful except some free radicals.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 The way to prevent that or delay it, I later found, was to protect the thyroid hormone function.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 So in the years since then, I've worked on ways to use the diet to decrease the formation of age pigment,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 to retard the increase in estrogen in the tissues, and to maintain an optimal thyroid function.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 OK, good. I know that you're very keen to emphasize the nutritional side of a person's lifestyle,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 rather than simply prescribing drugs or herbal supplements even.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 I know many of the people that have been listening to you in the past know about you.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 You have a pretty extensive website with plenty of articles on the website,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 and we'll be handing out that website address a bit later on.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 So in relation to diet, I know that the topic of high cholesterol is a fairly touchy subject,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 given that most of the statin - well, not most of them, but some of the statin drugs for sure -

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 have been implicated in causing reasonably severe side effects.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 What's your opinion, Dr. Peat, about the cause of high cholesterol,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 and how high a cholesterol do you consider high, and how would you approach its treatment?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 There was a study a few years ago of women in health rest home or convalescent hospital situations,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 and they followed them from the time they entered until they died,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 and watched how the level of cholesterol corresponded to their longevity and ability to function.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 And the optimal cholesterol level for that purpose, living a long time and keeping their mentality sound,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 was 270 milligrams per cent.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Wow.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Wow, and the current laboratories and doctors recommend that it should be under 200.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Well, there was a Framingham study, I think it was about 20 years ago,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 which looked at the cholesterol level of people as they passed the age of 50 in ordinary life situations,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 and they saw that those who did not have above a 200 milligram cholesterol level were more likely to become demanded.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Right.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 And it's been known for 80 or 90 years that cholesterol is an antitoxin, anti-inflammatory,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 our basic protective substance.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 It's like a protective hormone in itself.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 If it's increased in experiments with animals,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 the learning ability and mainstaying ability of the animal improves just for increasing the amount of cholesterol.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 And cell division involves cholesterol right in the apparatus that allows the cell to divide normally.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 It stabilizes red blood cells.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Every level of physiology is protected by adequate cholesterol.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Well, isn't it also true that every one of our cells has a cholesterol membrane?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 No.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Or is that another myth?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 No, the cholesterol is everywhere in the cell.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 It's stuck to the chromosomes, the structural, architectural microtubules and microfilaments all through the cell.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 It isn't just a membrane associated thing unless you say that the cell is like a sponge of membranes all the way through.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 It isn't just at the surface.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 But it is true that every one of our cells has cholesterol or utilizes cholesterol.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 Yeah, even the genetic apparatus is cholesterol is an essential component of every living process.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 The ability of cells to move requires cholesterol.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 So why do you think perhaps that modern mainstream medicine considers a figure of over 200

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 to be associated with a high instance of cerebrovascular?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 I think it's similar to why the optimal level of blood pressure has been revised downward.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 They can treat more patients and sell more drugs if more of the population is defined as sick.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Yeah.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 30 or 40 years ago, there was a study looking at people's blood pressure with aging.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 And those whose pressure kept rising with the years lived the longest.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 And a decrease of blood pressure indicated the nearness of death.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 So as long as blood pressure is on a steady rise, that was a good indicator.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 What values do you consider healthy and normal for blood pressure?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Well, the lower number is really partly an indicator of the elasticity of the system.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 It's how much pressure is there when the heart isn't beating.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 And so if the system is elastic, the lower number tends to be up around, approaching 80 usually is a good number.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 And the upper number should be less than 50 points higher than that.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 So 120 over 80 with a 40 point difference is very good.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 A good plumbing engineer knows that keeping the pressure steady without great rises and falls makes the water circulate more smoothly.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 It's the same in the bloodstream.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 You don't want the lower number to drop too low.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Otherwise, the blood stops moving.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 Okay.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Getting back to cholesterol, given that you would consider a value of 270 to be acceptable,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 is this more for elderly people or would this apply to younger people?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 That's for old people the same as the blood pressure thing.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 The cholesterol rises as there is a problem to be soothed.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 And when the tissues are less efficient, they need more blood supply.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 So the blood pressure and the cholesterol tend to rise with aging as tissues need more care and attention.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 So do you consider this to be a dangerous treatment that doctors might be prescribing statins to older people when their bodies need a higher cholesterol to protect them?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 Yes. There have been several studies that they always rouse a great reaction.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 But back in the mid-80s in Hungary, there was a big study in which they saw that using a drug to lower cholesterol increased the death rate from just about every cause.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Cancer, suicide, even getting murdered was more probable when a person had their cholesterol artificially lowered.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Would you perhaps cover some of those things that cholesterol is protective in and what it would be responsible for helping us?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 It is the main defensive substance but it in turn is converted into other protective substances, the first of which are pregnenolone and progesterone and also DHEA and other basic protective steroids.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 It should be massively converted into those more specific protective substances but it can only be converted when the thyroid is adequate.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 Explain that.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 In an experiment, they have put the bloodstream flowing into an organ like an ovary or an adrenal gland and if the blood contains vitamin A and thyroid,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 the amount of progesterone being produced by the gland varies directly with the amount of cholesterol going into the gland.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 So it's a massive quantitative conversion.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 So if you have a low blood cholesterol, then you're going to have a low production of progesterone coming from that ovary.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Yes, that's why it's dangerous to have it artificially lowered because it's the raw material for making all of the very specific protective steroids.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 This is why dementia is a positive reason why dementia would be higher in low cholesterol clients because these protective hormones are not being manufactured in sufficient amounts to prevent that degradation.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 There are several lines of reasoning that show that progesterone, for example, is extremely protective to the brain.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 It promotes healing and regeneration after the brain has been injured and it's now being tested in people who have had car accidents and made for brain damage, for example.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 It makes just a tremendous difference in survival rate and recovery rate.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 If your cholesterol is artificially lowered, your brain is going to be deficient in progesterone.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 The brain and the ovary, like we've been talking about, that they're very important or that cholesterol is very important for those organs.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 That's just two out of a lot of organs in our body and a lot of processes that require progesterone. Is that correct?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Yeah, every tissue has its response to progesterone. All nerves are stabilized by progesterone.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Skin and connective tissue, joints, for example, in the animal experiments as well as in people that I've seen, they can create emphysema artificially in an animal and cure it with progesterone.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 I've seen it happen in a week with a person just supplementing progesterone and they can breathe very nicely.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 Excuse me, Dr. Peat, can you please hold the phone a little closer to your mouth because we've just had some callers call in and say that they're having difficulty hearing you.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 We can hear you fine here in the studio, but perhaps live on the air, it's a little bit harder to hear you.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 So basically you're saying that this progesterone is very, very important for anti-aging and for keeping even normal cellular processes going.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 And if we don't have enough cholesterol in our bloodstream that's coming from our diet or that we're synthesizing,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 then we will probably have a low level of these protective hormones, progesterone being one of them.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 Yeah, and thyroid has to be present too for that conversion to take place.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 As early as 1993, it was found that doing the cholesterol treatment of rabbits, which caused circulatory disease,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 they found that if they gave the same amount of cholesterol to the rabbits and also some thyroid hormone, it didn't hurt their circulatory system.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 And the experimental cholesterol treatments have turned out to be using a toxic form of oxidized cholesterol.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 And if you just leave cholesterol sitting in a bottle too long before doing the experiment, it's likely to become oxidized.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 And some of the cooking practices that are recommended create the toxic oxidized form of cholesterol.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 For example, people often recommend that you steam salmon or fish to cook it at a lower temperature than frying it or grilling it.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 But it actually increases the toxic oxidized cholesterol so that steamed salmon has more toxic cholesterol than a grilled beefsteak.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 It's the slow oxygen exposure to unsaturated fats which creates the toxic effect.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 And the early experiments in Russia in 1912 treated the rabbits with cholesterol dissolved in vegetable oil.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 And it turns out that vegetable oil is the actual culprit in heart disease.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 So when they slice open someone's arteries around their heart and they see, oh, there's all this cholesterol that's blocking the arteries.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 The cholesterol is there primarily to protect the cells against the free radicals produced by the polyunsaturated fats.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 Okay, polyunsaturated fats for our listeners out there tonight are from vegetable oils including soy oil, corn oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 Fish oil.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Fish oil, all the canola oil, which in England is called rapeseed oil, cottonseed.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 And these are primarily the predominant oils used in the food chain.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 So are you saying that those oils are so damaging and so toxic to the lining of our arteries that it causes this toxic reaction breakdown inside our arteries and then our body tries to patch up with pieces of cholesterol?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 Yes, that was pretty well worked out in the 1940s.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 Lab animals were dying of various symptoms including infertility and softening of the brain.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 And it was found that it was because they were adding these unsaturated vegetable oils to their feed.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 And that turned out that it was blocking their thyroid function and preventing them from using the protective cholesterol.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 That series of experiments and observations had its ramifications through the 1940s and 50s, but agriculture took advantage of the anti-thyroid effect of these vegetable oils to use them to fatten animals economically.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 So instead of pigs being fed the compost, they were then fed corn and soy and their fat then represented a large amount of these vegetable oils.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 Yeah.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 It was common to use waste food like spoiling apples and vegetables and whey from the cheese factories and so on.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 But when they learned that they could fatten the pigs on much less food if it contained these unsaturated oils, that became the basic industrial animal food.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 Wow. Well, it makes sense to me because these vegetable oils are, you know, if it wasn't the Industrial Revolution, we wouldn't be able to make a product out of the oil so efficiently.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 And, you know, because it's not something we've naturally been eating for hundreds of years, thousands of years in such a concentrated form such as corn oil, it does make sense that this could be something that could be bad for you.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 Yeah. In Mark Twain's time, he told when he was driving the riverboat on the Mississippi, he told about hearing merchants talking about how cheap the cottonseed oil was from the cotton industry and that they were going to teach Americans to eat that instead of butter.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Wow.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 And that was already in the 1880s, I guess it was.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 Wow. I know there's another another subject, and I do believe it's linked to thyroid and perhaps you can bring that out for us.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 But diabetes seems to have been a disease that certainly exploded in terms of the numbers of people that are diagnosed with diabetes.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 And I know you also brought out last month or the month before in October a relatively close to home story about your own father, who ultimately didn't need to use any medication for his diabetes.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 But could you mention a little bit about diabetes and what can be done to treat that or why? I guess, number one, why is it such an exploded diagnosis and the routes of treatment for it?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Well, the diet of Americans and Europeans has changed over these years in which diabetes has been increasing with the greatly increased consumption of polyunsaturated vegetable oils.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 Even eggs now, they feed chickens so much corn and soy that even eggs have less cholesterol and more polyunsaturated fats.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 And in 1963 or 64, a researcher named P.J. Randle observed that he could block the oxidation of glucose just by feeding an increased amount of fatty acids.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 And that's now called the Randle cycle. And that when it became popular to feed hospitalized patients intravenously with a fatty emulsion to try to keep them from losing weight,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 they very quickly discovered that it suppressed their immune system and caused a variety of other symptoms.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 But it almost immediately would cause an elevation of blood glucose. And that was exactly what P.J. Randle had noticed in his animal studies.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 So the diabetes was basically explained biochemically in the 1960s when if you feed more fats, you block the response to insulin, create insulin insensitivity or resistance.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 And that's now called type 2 diabetes or syndrome X. And is this with any kind of fat, an increased fatty diet or is it just the vegetable fats?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 Well, no. When you feed people or animals a very high sugar diet, you can feed them so much that you greatly increase our own synthesis.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 But these fats are saturated or monounsaturated fats. And even if you feed so much that you cause a great increase in triglycerides circulating fat and even cause increased deposition of fat in the liver,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 for example, it's lowering the toxic effects of free radicals protecting the tissues. And it actually helps to lower the blood glucose.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 It has an anti-diabetic effect to feed a high sugar diet. Contrasting that with starch,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 the complex carbohydrate that dieticians have been recommending now for 30 years, the starches have the opposite effect.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 They increase your insulin resistance very quickly, just as if you were eating fat, because the starches don't support our own production of saturated fat.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 So you're saying that it's only the vegetable oils that actually lead to an increased blood glucose and the saturated fats actually help protect against the increased blood glucose.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 Yes, with the qualification that eggs and pork and chickens are now fed so much vegetable oil that their fats are toxic too.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 So it would only be the more saturated fats like from coconut oil or from butter. Right.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Wow. So not only are vegetable oils contributing to a damage to our arteries and then our body plucks it over with cholesterol.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 So they're actually the cause for cholesterol, supposedly cholesterol linked heart attacks.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 But also they're responsible for elevating blood glucose levels unnecessarily.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 OK. And then I think there's a mention about the estrogen in particular being also a co-factor in worsening the situation.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 What was the co-factor? Estrogen or increased estrogen.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 Yeah, estrogen causes increased deposition of fat in the liver and increased circulating triglycerides.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 But it interacts closely with the unsaturated fatty acids so that women typically have more of the polyunsaturated pre fatty acids circulating than men do.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 It's just a peculiarity of estrogen that it creates this bias that makes the polyunsaturated even more toxic than they would be.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 Right. Now, what would you say would be some of the best solutions to estrogen?

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 I guess first, as we're just just talking about it now,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 but for ladies perhaps listening that have either a history of estrogen type or estrogen dependent type situations or just estrogen,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 high estrogen in their menstruating life, how would they how would they ease that situation with natural or nutritional support?

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 About 70 years ago, there were studies in animals that showed how to do that.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 When people were in prison camps in the Second World War, they were a lot of them on the edge of starvation.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 And when they got out and were able to eat, it was found that many of the men developed breast

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 and animal experiments showed that a deficiency of protein causes the liver to be unable to remove estrogen

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 and also to inactivate or to to activate the thyroid hormone so that just eating more protein can sometimes activate metabolism

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 and cause the ratio to go towards progesterone and to eliminate estrogen.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 But women must be careful to avoid these animals that have this polyunsaturated fatty acid in their in the fat.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 Yes. You wouldn't want to eat mainly pork and poultry and fish because those are antithyroid.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 The number of unsaturations in the fatty acid, which is highest in fish oils, for example,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 that number corresponds with its ability to suppress the thyroid hormone function.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 And so cutting out those oils from the diet as far as possible, it isn't possible to eliminate them entirely,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 but eating as little as possible allows the thyroid to work more efficiently.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 And having around 80 to 100 grams of protein a day as a minimum, more doesn't hurt.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 120, 150 is very good for an active person. But also reducing the starches,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 which suppress our own ability to make the saturated fats, replacing the starches with fruit sugar.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 For example, in animal experiments, they have found that just adding Coca-Cola to an animal's diet will make it lean,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 able to eat much more food without gaining weight just because of the sugar in it.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 Were they replacing the starches in animals diet with the Coca-Cola?

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 Yes. Right. So then it was more of a sugar, like a natural fruit,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 but in the form of sucrose from the orange juices, the ideal way to get your sucrose.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 But you can increase your metabolic rate from the animal experiments to suggest you can increase it 50 percent.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 So you go from getting fat on fifteen hundred calories a day to getting lean on over 2000 calories a day.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 Just by cutting out all your starches, increasing your protein and replacing the starches with lots of fruit.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 And what about, you know, when I've had people tell me, oh, I can't eat that much protein because I get kidney stones.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 Well, the eating enough calcium, interestingly, is the best protection against that.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 And the sugar in fruit juice will act very much like vitamin D in vitamin D deficient diets.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 They found that if the animals ate starch, they became deficient in calcium.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 But if they ate sugar, they acted as if they were able to assimilate and retain the calcium just as well as getting some vitamin D.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 So the it is important to get vitamin D, but the sugar alone makes a tremendous difference in how you handle your calcium.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 And when you eat enough calcium, you suppress the inflammatory agent, including the thyroid hormone.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 So that the calcium goes into your bones and stays there rather than forming stones in your kidneys and doesn't go into your arteries and kidneys.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 So poison them. So then that would be a high calcium diet in conjunction with the high protein diet and a high fruit diet is what basically you're suggesting.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Yeah, that's why it's a quick therapy diet.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 I recommend a person having at least two quarts of milk and two quarts of orange juice every day because this will stimulate the thyroid going

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 and suppress inflammation and help the liver regulate things.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 And would you recommend when you recommend this to people, do you recommend that they have this in place of breakfast and lunch or as well as their normal three day meal?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 I mean, three meals a day.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 As it starts working, it will increase their caloric needs so that if they've been staying, maintaining their weight on a thousand or fifteen hundred calories,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 as the milk and orange juice start to activate their thyroid hormone and lower the estrogen and cortisol,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 they will gradually be able to increase their caloric intake up to at least two thousand calories a day.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 Wow, that's quite incredible. Really is quite incredible.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 You're listening, yeah. We better let people know what's going on, I think, because we've been so involved with talking to Dr. Peel and listening to his advice that I've forgotten to mention.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 You're listening to KMUD 91.1 FM and this show is Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Joining us this month is Dr. Ray Peat and we're very pleased to have him on the program.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 And he's very steeped in nutritional, certainly a nutritional approach to illness.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 And he has many remarkable tenets for his treatment and also some of those things that perhaps would be counterculture,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 especially the saturated fat versus polyunsaturated fat debate that's raging away now.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 So it's 7.37 now. So until the end of the program at eight o'clock, we usually open up the lines and people are invited to call in with any questions they may have

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 related to this month's topic surrounding high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 So if you live outside the area, the number is 1-800-568-3723. Or if you're in the area, the regular number is 923-3911.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 We haven't said much about high blood pressure, but the same diet, increasing your thyroid function,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 regulates the mineral balance such that it lowers your adrenaline, lowers the sympathetic nervous system activity

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 and allows the minerals to be balanced with water so that increased thyroid function lowers blood pressure.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 Although many doctors have been misled. You think it would be the opposite, but it's not.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 I know I have an article here from the Clinical Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism from May 2002,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 and it was showing that the role of thyroid hormone in blood pressure and keeping blood pressure stable

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 and also showed that there's evidence from short term hypothyroidism in humans where people will have elevated blood pressure.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 We'll get back to that in a moment. We have a caller on the line.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 Dr. Ray Peek, is that your name?

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 Mm-hmm.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 How do you spell that, please?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 P-E-A-T.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 P-E-A-T?

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 P-E-A-T.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 T-A-T? Okay. Earlier I heard you talking about productive cholesterol is important for connective tissue.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 Did you say something like that?

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 Yes.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 Now, I was born with a rare disease where I don't have any connective tissue over my whole body.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 Have you heard of such a thing?

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 Is your tissue very elastic?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 No, I don't have the elasticity.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 Like a--

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 Scaradama, is it?

00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 Yeah, and it's like I blister, I break open all the time, like there's no real treatment for it yet.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 Like when they open up the stem cell research, maybe then they might find a cure for it.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 Have you tried increased amounts of vitamin E?

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 Yeah, I did when I was younger and that made me very horny, very horny, and I couldn't control it hardly.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 It was-- I got out a girlfriend, but it was shocking to her too.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 Working on your hormones so that you can use enough of the antioxidants, sometimes that corrects that blister susceptible disease.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 Could I achieve that goal with a hyperbaric chamber?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 No.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 No.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 Going to a higher altitude, in fact, where you get a lower oxygen pressure is more likely to help.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 Okay.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 So the name-- I guess, you know, can I have your address?

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 Do you have an address that I can write to you further about this?

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 Do you have Internet access?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 Yes.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 I don't, but I could use a computer at the library or--

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 Well, let me give you his website and you can contact Dr. Peat through his website.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Okay.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 And also you can read a lot of-- he has a lot of his free newsletters online there that you can read for yourself.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 Good.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Okay, so it's www.raypeat, R-A-Y--

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 Yeah.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 Peat, P-E-A-T.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 P-E-A-T.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 Dot com.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 Dot com, okay.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 So it's www.raypeat.com and then you can go ahead and contact him directly through there.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 Okay, thank you very much.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 Okay, I don't know if there are any other callers on the line.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 No.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 Okay, so--

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 So, Dr. Peat, it's long been known that people with high functioning of thyroid or hyperthyroidism,

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 that they can suffer from high blood pressure,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 but there's also research that shows that people with low blood pressure can also be--

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 I'm sorry, people with low thyroid function can also be suffering with high blood pressure.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 In general, the research shows that increasing thyroid function lowers blood pressure,

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 and I think what has happened over the last 30 years or 40 years,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 I've seen two or three people who actually had hyperthyroidism without a doubt,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 but I've seen dozens who were told by their doctors that they were hyperthyroid,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 but as I encouraged them to talk to their doctors about how the diagnosis was made,

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 many of them said, "But the doctor says I'm at the same time hypothyroid and hyperthyroid."

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 Doctors have been so confused that they say you can be both hyper and hypo at the same time,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 and most of these people that I have seen who had a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 were actually classical hypothyroid cases just that doctors don't read the old textbooks anymore.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 For example, one thing that happens very often in hypothyroidism

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 is that the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenaline production

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 increase to compensate for the lack of thyroid actual energy production,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 and I've seen people with 40 times the daily output of adrenaline times the normal amount who were hypothyroid.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 So because their body is so low thyroid and their metabolism is so slow,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 their body is trying to compensate by stimulating adrenaline production,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 and of course, what does adrenaline do but raise blood pressure?

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 Yeah, and I've seen people who had as fast a pulse as 180 beats per minute at rest year after year

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 who that was taken as one of the diagnostic features for hyperthyroidism,

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 but when they took thyroid within a week for the first time in years,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 they had a normal pulse rate of 80 or 90 by lowering the adrenaline.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 Because it was supplying the thyroid hormone that they were lacking in the first place.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 So this is what I wanted our listeners to be aware of is that a lot of times,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 modern medicine just treats the disease.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 It doesn't treat the cause of the disease.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 So high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes are so common in America today and in the world today,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 and if you look deeper, the cause of this could be thyroid disease which is easily treated,

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 and there's dietary recommendations that Dr. Peat has described some of tonight that can help your thyroid health,

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 and the medication is also fairly innocuous and safe to take.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 So can you tell us anything more about the interaction between the high blood pressure and the thyroid, Dr. Peat?

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 Yeah, the toxemia of pregnancy or preeclampsia is one of the things that got me interested in how blood pressure is regulated by thyroid.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 It's very common starting in the 1950s when the drug companies came out with their chemical diuretics.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 They told women that if they take their diuretics and restrict salt intake during pregnancy,

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 that they'll prevent the high blood pressure of toxemia,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 and what they were doing was starving the developing baby of an adequate blood supply by reducing the blood volume,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 and they created millions of stressed, damaged pregnancies by restricting the salt intake,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 and the adrenaline rises when you restrict the salt intake just as it does when you restrict the thyroid function.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 And so I noticed that premenstrual syndrome had many features in common with toxemia of pregnancy,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 and women were told to restrict their salt intake premenstrually,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 and because some researchers found that they could cure toxemia and bring the blood pressure down to normal

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 by giving the women adequate amounts of salt and protein,

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 I suggested that for premenstrual syndrome, women who get swollen feet and so on,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 try eating as much sodium as they crave, and sometimes that's a very large amount,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 maybe 15 grams a day premenstrually is what they crave naturally,

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 and they found that it prevented their swelling feet and other symptoms.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 So after seeing that work, not only in the pregnancy research, but in many women with premenstrual symptoms,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 I saw that old people very often had a similar syndrome,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 and when they would go on a salt-restricted diet, they would develop insomnia very frequently,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 suggesting that their adrenaline had gone up.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 So I suggested to some friends who were in their 80s that they start eating as much salt as they felt like,

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 and not only did they sleep better, but their blood pressure came down.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 It's completely counter to what you'd normally hear.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 Well, salt at one time was highly treasured and was used as a monetary trading.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 So, I mean, it's just a very modern way of thinking that salt is bad for you, really.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 It's very, very modern. We've been dependent upon salt for forever.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 A man named David McCarran 30 years ago noticed that the government figures

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 that were used to support the low-salt diet treatment for high blood pressure,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 he noticed that in the actual figures, the people who ate the most salt had the lowest blood pressure,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 and those who ate the least salt had the highest blood pressure,

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 and he saw that what they had been neglecting was the calcium intake

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 that often went the other direction of the sodium.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 People didn't eat milk and cheese. They would often eat salty snack foods.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 But he showed that it wasn't the sodium excess that was causing high blood pressure.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 It was the calcium deficiency.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 So perhaps these people that have been on a low-salt diet,

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 they need to increase their salt and increase their calcium foods.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 Yeah, and obesity is another thing that is often associated with high blood pressure,

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 but the same thing applies to obesity.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 The people--I noticed it when I was traveling in the Slavic countries.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 There was very little milk available, and lots of the people were very fat.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 And as soon as I went across the border from Russia into Finland,

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 I saw the stores were full of milk and cheese, and everyone was slender and healthy.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 And that was how I looked up David McCarron's work with calcium.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 And it turns out that salt and calcium both, as you increase them,

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 your metabolic rate increases, your ability to oxidize sugar,

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 and the antidiabetic effect is increased with increasing sodium and calcium.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 And obesity is decreased because you're burning your sugar.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 Rather than converting it into fat and storing it.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 Yeah, with chickens, they did that.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 They gave them slightly salty water, almost like seawater.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 And all of the signs of aging as well as obesity were decreased

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 just by having to drink a little salt water.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 So they quickly took the salt water away because they want the chickens to be nice and obese

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
 so they can make more money.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 Yeah, those were just lab chickens.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 So they couldn't sell that to the chicken industry to say,

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 "Here, the salt is going to fix your financial problems."

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 Yeah, no one cares if chickens live, healthy old chickens.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 It's a little bit off the subject perhaps, but about diuretics,

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 I guess I'm thinking of sodium and salt and diuretics and the kind of--

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 the osmolar concentration of the blood and how diuretics work to excrete more water, etc., etc.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 Do you have any safe methods for increasing diuresis?

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 Yeah, calcium, it helps.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 By optimizing sugar metabolism, it energizes the kidneys so that they work better.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 But baking soda and sodium chloride both have a diuretic effect.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 And the only chemical diuretic that I would recommend in any situation

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 happens to be one that skiers are now using to prevent mountain sickness.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 It's called Diamox, and it was originally used to lower eyeball pressure to prevent glaucoma.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 And how it works is that it increases your carbon dioxide in your tissues,

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 and that helps to regulate the salt.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 And it's used in many conditions, including epilepsy and glaucoma, as well as high blood pressure.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 Excellent. Okay, we have a call on the line, Dr. Peat. So, you're on the air.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 Hello. I just wondered how olive oil is.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 If in a quantity like as much as a tablespoon a day, it's fine.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 But it does have 10% of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 10%. Is it okay when it's cooked?

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000
 Yeah, those fats are toxic.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 Even if you eat cold-pressed unsaturated fats, they warm up in your body,

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 and then the blood pumps catalysts and oxygen through the warm fat,

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 so it doesn't matter how fresh they are when you eat them.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 They're going to get rancid anyway once they're in your body.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 Okay, thank you. Bye.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 Thanks for your call.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 Did you want to carry on?

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 Okay, so carrying on with high blood pressure and the diuretics,

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000
 sodium chloride, can you explain, Dr. Peat, how salt can actually be a diuretic

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 when we've been so ingrained in thoughts of human beings?

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 In these studies, Tom Brewer and his wife wrote some books, nutrition for pregnant women,

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 two or three books on the subject, and he gives the research background.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:30.000
 But how it works is that estrogen suppresses your ability to make albumin,

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 and it makes your blood vessels leaky, and it causes you to lose sodium easily.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 So the blood volume decreases, and the kidneys don't get enough oxygen or sugar

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 because of the shrinking loss of sodium and albumin.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 The albumin getting into your tissues causes toxic effects as it leaks out of the bloodstream,

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 and the kidneys put out hormones that drive your heart to beat harder

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 and tighten up your blood vessels to try to increase the circulation to the kidneys

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 and in the case of pregnancy to the uterus to feed the developing baby.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 And just by the--albumin doesn't work to retain water

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 when there's not an associated cloud of sodium atoms bound to the albumin in the bloodstream.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 And so just by eating sodium, the albumin which is still in your bloodstream

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 now has an ability to osmotically attract water,

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 and eating salt will pull water back into your bloodstream, increase the blood volume.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
 And then you can excrete it through your kidneys.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 Yeah, and then it perfuses the kidneys, energizes them,

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
 and they stop driving the blood vessels to tighten up,

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 and so it lets the excess sodium out.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 Okay, well that's a very interesting description.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 We do have time for one more caller,

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 but we have to remind callers that we need to make it quick because it's four minutes until the end of the show.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:28.000
 Yes, I have a question about how your thyroid relates to Lyme disease.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:35.000
 Well, the whole immune system is the issue there.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:42.000
 A very healthy immune system can throw off chronic infections like that.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.000
 Like Lyme disease?

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 Yeah, it's best to do it quickly with an antibiotic,

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 but you always want to back up the antibiotic with an optimized immune system,

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 and the thyroid and calcium and vitamin D are really basic things to make your immune system not cause inflammation,

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 but to be able to eliminate pathogens.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000
 All right, thank you, Dr. Enteristain Program.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 Thank you.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:29.000
 Well, as I said, it's three minutes to now, so we better give an outro, a thank you to Dr. Peat.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000
 Thank you very much, Dr. Peat, for joining us on the show,

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 and for those listeners who would like to read more about the information Dr. Peat has to share,

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 if you can log on, not log on, sorry, if you can go visit his website at www.rayPeat.com,

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 and that's R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 He has numerous articles there that are free of charge to read, newsletters that he has written.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 And I can usually send a few references for issues that I don't have on the website if people email me.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:09.000
 If you have questions about specific conditions and you'd like to email Dr. Peat, you can do that.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 Alternatively, you can consult with Andrew and I, and we can email Dr. Peat on your behalf.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 If you have any further questions, you can call us on 888-WBM-ERB, and that's 926-4372.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 And thank you very much for listening to the show, and thank you very much, Dr. Peat, for joining us this evening.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 Thank you.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000
 Thank you for your time.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 Bye.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 Okay, well, for all of those of you who listened, we thank you for tuning in.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 For those of you who have ears, let them hear.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 And we'll be joining you again next year in 2009.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 So for all of you, we wish you a very merry Christmas and a prosperous new year.
