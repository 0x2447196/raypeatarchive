00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show, which runs every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend all herbs, supplements, nutritional counseling, etc.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 So, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions, either related or unrelated, to this month's subject of exploring alternatives.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 If you're listening and you want to call in after 7.30 or even before, the number here if you live in the area is 923 3911,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD, which is 1-800-568-3723, and we'll give those numbers out during the show.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Okay, so, once again, I just want to introduce people to our main guest speaker, Dr. Raymond Peat. Are you there, Dr. Peat?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Yes.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Okay, thanks so much for joining us again.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 As always, and as hopefully, the new listeners to the show, I know there's lots of other people who listen to the shows repeatedly and/or who listen to the podcast,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 but for those people who perhaps have never heard your voice or read any of your work,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 would you just outline your academic and professional background for those people so that they can get a good sense of who you are?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 I got a master's degree in general studies with work in literature and philosophy and other things from the University of Oregon.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Then about eight years later, I went back to specialize in biology, especially physiology of aging and reproduction for a PhD in 1972.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Okay. All right, well, let's start the show then.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 So, in your recent newsletter, which was entitled "Comments on Cancer Therapy," you coined the phrase, I think it may be it was you, I've not heard it before,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 but you coined the phrase "trust annoyer" in response to your definition of paranoia, that being the belief that powerful forces are trying to harm you.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 In the former, trust annoyer is the irrational belief that those in power are working for your benefit.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 So in trust annoyer, then, a carefully sculpted directive and narrative has been foisted on us in the form of powerful entities,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 often protected from prosecution, as in the case of vaccine makers, for example, who tell us they have the answer and only they can help us,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 just like the governments generally do with the usual results being inefficiency and waste.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 But the medical industry, in particularly, their failed war on cancer, along with all the other wars,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 has yielded few results at the cost of countless suffering and death.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 And you outlined a chronology culminating in the infamous Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 which a lot of people listening, perhaps the alternative populations, have certainly heard about,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 especially with the Rockefellers and their central banking.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 So this was at the beginning of the 20th century, then, this was pivotal in the establishment of these powerful institutions of the false religion,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 of the mechanistic biology, as opposed to holistic and relevant research, which you constantly bring out,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 which has only just emerged in publications and theories from eminent scientists,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 of whom you've previously mentioned, from Gilbert Ling to Gerald Pollack and the others,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 and the other scientists like May Wan Ho and the others that Brad and Jeremy have been busy interviewing

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 in their coming expose on the back of a tiger, which we're all waiting for.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Can you discuss the shift in perception that's occurring away from the dogma, which has been upheld for so long?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Yeah. First, I want to mention that the word "trustanoia" was, I think, coined by Laura Nader, an anthropologist.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 But the shift of perception, I think it's only partial.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 In biology, there's a lot of good science that's picking up or continuing from the ideas that were suppressed around the Second World War.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 When those institutions, including the medical establishment, which fused itself with state power and the foundations,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 the science that was being developed by the government for warfare was shifted over to take advantage of these mechanical,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 mechanistic ideas that medicine had developed.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 So the government and the medical establishment really began powerfully working together right after the Second World War

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 with a lot of money flowing from the government to medical research,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 which was sometimes you couldn't distinguish it from biological warfare research.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Some of the same people went right from one field to the other.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 For example, Carlton Gydasek, who got the Nobel Prize for slow virus research.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 He was working in biological warfare, and I've outlined some of my suspicions about how he came to invent that idea of the slow virus.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 I suspect it was a cover up for the effects of radiation on the brain and other organisms rather than this hypothetical virus that Gydasek invented.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 The dogma has essentially denied all of the traditional ideas of biology and the nature of life to impose the idea that things are predefined.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Gregor Mendel in the 19th century, the idea of the gene was gradually used to deny that plant breeders and animal breeders were really changing the plants.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 If they seemed to be producing big animals from little animals or big plums from little plums,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 the most radical changes they were producing, rather than being adaptive to the environment,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 the textbooks of the time I was in graduate school said, well, these were genes that really existed previously.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Now, we've just for the first time in science, we have simply revealed that there were genes for these traits,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 which the plant and animal developers seem to be producing.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 So it seems that there were these secret genes that explained everything.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 It really was sort of a magic act or metaphysics that made up the story that went along to explain things that really could more easily be explained by the idea that the organism is highly adaptive.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 The gene idea allowed people to work, create changes in the DNA so that they could now produce engineered organisms.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 After a hundred years of denying that there really was any adaptation, they said, and now that we're in control of the genes, we'll make organisms the way we want them.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 But they were claiming that it was purely in the genes and that they could control it.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 So there was no danger of things being unpredictable or going wrong.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 People like Barbara McClintock, who in the 1940s and 50s, she was demonstrating that organisms can change their own genes to adapt to situations.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 So the idea of being determined by their genes was exactly turned on its head by her and other people who showed that the organisms change their own genes in an organized way.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 So what do you think is going to happen with genetically modified organisms?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Do you think they're going to start changing the genes that have been put in them?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 When you realize how ignorant the molecular biologists and molecular geneticists have been,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 you have to worry that things could be much, much worse than anyone so far has suspected.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 James Watson of Watson and Crick, who invented the structure to explain the double helix of DNA, he's now 88 years old.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 And just a couple of weeks ago, he was quoted in the New York Times as saying if he was starting over to understand cancer, he would not study molecular biology.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 He would study biochemistry.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 He said he never thought he would have to learn the Krebs cycle.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 He said, now, just a couple of months ago, I had decided it would be necessary.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 But the arrogance of these geneticists meant that they simply didn't have to know anything at all about biology.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 Purely reductionist thinking.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 Yeah.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 So getting on to the kind of change in perception, I think you made an interesting point when I read your newsletter that science essentially was becoming a private matter.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 And that was in reference to the procuring of difficult substances to get like radioactive isotopes for doing research.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Now, governments in this situation would be entirely responsible for distributing radioactive substances to companies.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 Obviously, it would be under their control.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 But they would largely be able to, I would think, predict the outcomes which they wanted to find in terms of having complete control over this material.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 It's not like you can just get radioactive isotopes from anywhere and do your own research and find information contrary to what it is they might want to tell you about the supposed safety perhaps of some of these things.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 But that was pretty interesting.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 You were talking about the application of various medical approaches being very closely controlled by a fairly large overseeing industry, which we'll have mentioned the medicine industry as being exactly that.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 And extremely lucrative, profitable, and to be very much protected from any assaults.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Where you also made reference to in the early stages of the formation of doctors and the industry, the doctors themselves wanted government to protect them from other practitioners.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 And you mentioned the heroic, I thought it was very funny, but it's very true, the heroic medicine that was practiced by these early doctors included using mercury, bleeding, vomiting, diuresis, enuresis, and all sorts of purgative mechanisms by which some, if not quite a large proportion of patients died.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 And then of course turned to alternatives because the doctors were being so blatant about what they're doing and overtly killing people that the, you know, whether it was, I don't know, the local folk medicine or midwives or other people that had various skills in different areas and were definitely used before that.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 This was then being seen as the alternative that they had to pursue because otherwise this heroic medicine was just going to kill more people than not.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 Recently anthropologists were able to identify the places where the Lewis and Clark expedition had camped by finding so much mercury in the soil.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 Oh my goodness.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 Okay.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 So just in terms of the protectionist, I mean, we almost call it a racket.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 I mean, I'm sure it is a racket.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 I think that's probably the best term for it actually.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 This protectionist approach to medicine and how a lot of the research is very hard to either replicate because the products that they're being used are issued under very tightly controlled circumstances or whether in fact the results of some of these outcomes are really not laid out accurately.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 And that's why we find postdoc or PhD research being done to show the opposite is true for a lot of the things that we're being told by the quote unquote authority on medicine that this is the way it is.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 And that, for example, as we've mentioned many times, and you've brought this out in the very early days that, you know, sugar is essential for you.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 It's not bad for you.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 The same goes for salt.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 The same goes for saturated fat.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 And all these lies that they would have us believe when actually there is evidence which is done by very credible scientists and PhD researchers.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 So the fact that the authority out there is a quote unquote authority doesn't mean to say that you have to believe it.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 And this I found it very funny.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 I've never heard the trust annoyer quote before.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 So that made me maybe chuckle quite a bit because the opposite generally in questioning society is paranoid that they're doing something that's not good for us.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 I know here, especially on the West Coast of California, you know, we look up at the skies and we look at the chem trails and we see them spreading out and we just like that is not normal.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 You know, we read about and hear about fluoride in the water and we're very skeptical and what that pulled out of the water is no reason for it at all to be in there.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 And research shows that it's very damaging.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 There's many other instances where the supposed authority and the government that most people definitely shouldn't look at as being the final say in anything has total control over this.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 So it's very it's always very good to be skeptical and not just accept what they're saying as a truth, but really do your own research.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 And that's that's why we love having you on the show, Dr. Peate, because you've done a lot of this research and you brought out so many things that have illuminated a lot of seemingly obvious facts to people when they read the research.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 So you know, there's there's one group that I've read many of their papers that were published over a period of about 50 years.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 And back in the 50s and 60s, Otto Warburg had completely ignored the gene mutation theory of cancer and was showing that it was definable and understandable in terms of a simple metabolic imbalance.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 And starting in the 1960s, the Pentagon started financing people who worked on projects to debunk and disprove supposedly, or at least defame Otto Warburg.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 And one of these groups is still publishing as recently as last year, I read some papers saying that Otto Warburg was wrong because we etc.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 And their reasoning isn't right. They're misinterpreting what Warburg said, but it's so important that the Pentagon has consistently financed people to push a doctrine such as disproving supposedly ideas that would have invalidated the whole war on cancer.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 And as if our tax dollars should be supporting the Pentagon to do such work.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 Now correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't it the FBI that I heard this the other week and I'm like, Hmm, that sounds like actually pretty plausible.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 I remember watching a Mel Gibson movie a long time ago, Conspiracy Theorist, it was called.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 Now it wasn't, and I heard also that the FBI were the organization that coined the term conspiracy theorist, just to give people the one word phrase that would debunk any person who was coming out with some fairly controversial and surprising news about something that was supposedly accepted as fact.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 And it was just regularly used as a kind of method of invalidating anybody who had any sense of truth that was looking in the opposite direction.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 So the word conspiracy theorist on its own right was coined by a kind of government agents to turn this on its head.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 And when they have hundreds of billions of dollars to spend on their conspiracy, it becomes so pervasive, you can hardly say it's a conspiracy.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 It's an alternate reality that they're constructing.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 All right, well, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Galbraithville, 91.1 FM, also on the web at KMUD.org.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 If you're in the area, there's a 923 number, 923 3911.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 If you're outside the area, it's 1-800-KMUD-RAD, which is 1-800-568-3723. From 7.30 till the end of the show, callers are very welcome to call in with any questions about this month's subject of exploring the alternatives.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with 40 years or thereabouts of postdoc research coming our way with lots of facts and figures about the relevance of what we read and hear and we think is true, but he actually has a very different viewpoint in which to see that.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 And Dr. Peat, I time and time again, even though I've spoken to you quite a lot and we have had you on the radio show a lot, I still have to remind myself that your perspective is very much a biology-based perspective and I think to remember what you said earlier in the radio show, I think that's a point that a lot of people forget is that biology has really been superseded, isn't it, and squashed, if you like, by the tax dollar corporate model.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 The model of genetics and the war on cancer.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 Yeah, the medical establishment has had its own reasons for following their theory of cancer, but it has been reinforced by the government's biological warfare perspective.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 So they've blended them together to say that everything is determined by the DNA and you don't have to learn anything about biology or about the chemistry of life itself.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Let me get you to hold that thought a moment because I think we have one or two callers who have already been calling in.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 So let's see if we can take this first call away from and what's your question?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 Caller, you're on the air? I can't hear the caller, I'm not sure what's going on. So bear with me for a minute. Caller, you're on the air?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 I'll ask the doctor if he could talk about any alternatives for emphysema, as opposed to something other than the pills that they give and the respirators that they give, and I will take my answer on the air.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Okay. Dr. Peat, did you hear that? Because I didn't catch the first part about emphysema.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 I've had a couple of very interesting experiences with people who had apparent emphysema. That was the diagnosis. Extremely inefficient lungs.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 One person was purple in the face and his memory was affected. He was getting so little oxygen to his brain. The other person was a woman in her 30s who had been that way for about 15 years.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 In the woman's case, it started when she had multiple estrogen injections when she was about 20. And that got me reading about the history of experimental emphysema.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 And they found that they could reduce the ability of the lungs to absorb oxygen by 90% in just an hour after an injection of an excess amount of estrogen.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 In the case of the man, I suspected that it was a combination of too much unsaturated fat in his diet increasing his estrogen actions and decreasing his thyroid function.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 So I gave him some progesterone and pregnenolone and I think a little thyroid. And in two weeks, the next time I saw him, that was in Toluca, altitude well over 8,000 feet.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 And his office was upstairs in a building without an elevator. And two weeks after he was sitting puffing and purple, he took me around the city, took me up to his office,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 and we were just zooming up the ramps, 82 or 83 years old at that time, and fully functional lungs as quickly as two weeks.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 And the young woman tried different things, but she noticed that she felt better when a doctor prescribed armor thyroid. And she kept talking him and giving her bigger doses,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 and she got him up to five grains and she was feeling pretty recovered. But she went to another doctor and got another five grains from him. And with the third doctor each prescribing five grains as what they considered a maximum dose,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 she recovered completely over a period of two or three months. With 15 grains of thyroid a day. Yeah, but if you don't activate the thyroxine in armor thyroid, which is three quarters of the active material,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 you're only getting a fourth of it. So in effect, she was only getting about four grains of activity. Right. So you're looking at emphysema in both of these cases, and it's really is an energy depletion and or factors that are contributing to inflammation and calcium influx being pushed back by thyroid hormone?

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 Yeah, there were animal studies 20, 30, 40 years ago in which progesterone resolved their emphysema. And pregnenolone and progesterone both allow cells to handle water properly so that they don't swell up and they retain normal elasticity.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 Got it. We do have another call on here. So let's get this take this next caller and see where we're going. Caller you're on the air. What's your question?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 Hi, I had a question. What do you think of using the anti adrenaline drug? Quantity and to reduce adrenaline at night? I've read some people's experience with using 100 microgram dose and it's working quite well. So yeah, what was the name of that? Quantity quantity quantity quantity and GU colon adenine?

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 The adrenaline drug? Clonidine maybe CLNO. CLON.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 Yeah, that's a blood pressure lowering drug too.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 Sometimes yeah, a low thyroid person sometimes compensates by producing gigantic amounts of adrenaline just to keep running. It helps to maintain their body temperature at normal and keeps their heart rate up. And they can seem even hyper thyroid sometimes when they have very high blood pressure.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 They have very little T3 production or very high reverse T3 blocking it. And when these people have their daily adrenaline measured in their urine, some of them are making 30 or 40 times more than the normal amount just to compensate for hyper thyroidism.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 And those people, they often feel a great reduction of anxiety and tension pressure and so on.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 But since the adrenaline is compensating in many ways, keeping their blood sugar up, it's important to be very cautious when you oppose the adrenaline because it can sometimes give you asthma or low blood sugar.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 Because if it swings the other way, you're talking about it kind of crashes.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 Yeah.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 Do you think it could be used safely at a dose such as 100 micrograms? Does that sound like a reasonable dose? Do you know?

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 I've never experimented with it myself. I don't know what the right dose would be.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 Okay. I've also read that it actually lowers cortisol as well. So do you think that would be in a direct fashion or indirectly as perhaps a result of it lowering the adrenaline? Adrenaline in chronic excess is also highly stressful and the organism can definitely keep the cortisol high.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Yeah. The cortisol generally follows a period of excess adrenaline. So if you take your adrenaline down, it might let you over your cortisol unless you over your glucose too much and that can increase your cortisol.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 Yeah. Salt and sugar are great ways to lower adrenaline. I recommend that to people who are performing and they're anxious before they perform. Tell them, stir in a little salt in a glass of orange juice. It works great.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 Okay. Well, thanks for your call.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Okay. Thank you.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 Okay. So it's 730 here. You're listening to Ask Your Ab Doctor KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM. The call-in number for this area here is 923-3911 or if you live outside the area or you're on the web, 1800-KMUD-RAD, which is 1-800-568-3723 for your calls and Dr. Ray P is our guest.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 Okay. So Dr. Peat, I guess moving on, I wanted to ask you a little bit about epigenetics. So you've mentioned the study of epigenetics, which is currently getting quite a lot of attention as providing clues to many different pathologies stemming from environmental origins or ingested pollution, both atmospheric and dietary.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 Now, we fully understand the world we live in now as far more toxic than the world the Native American Indians, for example, lived in with cancers and diabetes almost unknown then, but which now are commonplace.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 It's important now than ever to make sure you're eating organically raised food, drinking organic milk and juices that you mentioned orange juice a lot, as well as clean filtered water and the same goes for the water you bathe in with added fluoride causing known cancers.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 From a holistic perspective, there exists a very real mind-body connection between your thoughts and your health that we've mentioned in previous shows and the convincing benefits of meditation or stilling the mind being healing.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 What do you see as the mechanisms by which this acts in terms of meditation? Because I know you have a biological perspective. And you're telling me there's another caller there. Oh, okay. Let's hold that thought for a second if you can retain what I've asked you.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 But let's take this next caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Yeah, I'm from the Laytonville area.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 Okay. What's your question?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 I was wondering, I read an article recently and it said it was about the duality of taste buds.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 Of taste buds?

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 Yeah. It was written by a, I think you pronounce it, rhinocinus doctor?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Rhinocite? No.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 Yeah, rhinocinus.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 Rhinocinusitis. Rhinocinusitis.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 Yeah, that might be it.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 Yeah.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 People who are constantly sick and have a cold or flu-like syndrome.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 Got it. You have a running nose and...

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 Yeah, and they were claiming that the bitter taste buds are the body's first line of defense.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 And the cilia acts as like a filter for bacteria. And then in the nose it releases nitric oxide.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 It does all this great stuff and tells the body that something that could hurt it is entering the system.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 Okay.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 And I was wondering if you guys thought that maybe like smoking or being in a, you know, like the fires we've had recently,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 could coat these cilia or the taste buds and give you the symptoms kind of like rhinocinusitis.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 Sinusitis.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 Sinusitis.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 Okay. Well, I've got my thoughts.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 But Dr. Peat, what's your thought on whether or not the atmospheric pollution from forest fires that the callers mentioned might contribute to this situation, rhinocinusitis?

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 And also smoking, too.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 And smoking, yeah.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 Yeah, all of these things are not only contacting the membranes locally in your nose and mouth, but when you breathe them, you swallow them because they dissolve in the saliva.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 And in the last few years, people have been observing the same sort of taste buds existing in the intestine so that your intestine can detect the chemistry of what's present,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 even though you aren't consciously maybe tasting it, but the nerves are still doing their chemical analysis.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 And so one of the things that andrologists have been noticing for 100 years is that the inflammation of the nose and throat very often starts in the intestine.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 If you have a chemical irritant or a stretching from gas or constipation or a viral or bacterial infection, there can be no toxin or germ present in your nose,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 but the nose will get inflamed and start running.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 And then later, after the inflammation is under way, then it can pick up germs.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 But there's a very close integration between the respiratory system and the intestine.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 So things that you've eaten will affect the rightnitis.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 And that's something that people often neglect.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 They'll take vitamin pills thinking that it'll help their immunity or their allergies.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 But I've seen dozens of people who recovered from their chronic runny nose when they stopped taking their vitamin and mineral supplements.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 Is there anything you would recommend to take?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 Or food to eat?

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 Avoiding irritating foods, green salads, uncooked vegetables, and many seeds and nuts are always irritating.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 And some people can have a runny nose from just having a salad once a week.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 It sets up a chronic irritation in their intestine.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 All right.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 Thank you very much.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 That was very, very informative.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 Thank you.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 You're very welcome.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 Don't forget that people listening, you can always listen to this podcast on the web at www.kmud.org.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 Go to the audio archives and just select Friday Night Live, and it's the third Friday of every month.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 Okay, I think we have two or three callers, so let's get going with these next callers.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 Next caller, where are you from, and what's your question?

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 Hi, I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 Okay, hey, welcome to the show.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 What's your question?

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 Dr. Peat, I was on a low-carb diet for two years and ate a lot of artificial sweetener during that time.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 I have two questions.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 The first one is what negative effects have artificial sweeteners had on my body?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 And the second one is how can I undo or is it even possible to undo those negative effects?

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 The artificial sweeteners sometimes activate insulin and cause weight gain just by acting on your hormones,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 even without increasing your food intake, but they have different toxicities.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 Some of them are excitotoxins if you eat large quantities of them, but usually if you just stop using them

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 and eat a proper non-irritating diet, things will correct themselves just nutritionally.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 Oh, wow, that's great.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 Thank you very much.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 You had a second question?

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 He answered it.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 Okay, all right.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 Thanks for your call.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 Okay, we have another caller on the air, so let's take this next caller.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 I'm from Yucaipa, Southern California.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 Okay, what's your question?

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 I wanted to find out if Dr. Peat knows anything about alternatives for seizure medication.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Okay, I'm sure.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 In fact, I know.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 Dr. Peat, seizure medication or in fact your rational approach to treating epilepsy or other seizures?

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 Since we were just talking about the intestine, that's something that should always be taken into account.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 Make sure that you're not disturbing your system by eating green smoothies or too many nuts and raw foods and such

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 because irritation in the digestive system will increase the things that promote seizures or lower the threshold for them.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 The brain is one of our biggest steroid-forming organs.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 It produces considerable amounts of DHEA, progesterone, pregnenolone, and metabolites of those.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 Those have a quieting effect.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 When the brain is under stress, those increase to compensate for the excitatory effect.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 There are some foods that specifically excite and damage the nerves and tend to predispose you to seizures.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 Amino acids, for example, including glutamic acid, aspartic acid, cysteine, and tryptophan are the worst amino acids for lowering the threshold.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 Supplements of progesterone have been used to reduce the sensitivity to various factors.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 The threshold to excitation and seizure increases in proportion to the amount of pregnenolone, progesterone, and several of the metabolites of these.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 I had a client that had epilepsy and she was able to wean herself off all of her medication and resume driving and lives a very normal life now.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 She sticks to a very strict diet that doesn't have any kind of food that the bacteria can live on in her intestine.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 She takes pregnenolone and progesterone and she has a thyroid prescription.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 She also takes anti-adrenaline herbs like filarian and skullcap and passionflower.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 She had grand mal seizures, didn't she?

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 Yes.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 My daughter, she's 35. She's had them since she was 5.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 We tried the Progest-E. She was taking about one to two bottles every three days, but she was able to reduce her medication by 75%.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 But she just couldn't keep that up because you can't keep taking that much.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 Dr. Peat, what do you think about the dose of progesterone that you and the callers talked about?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 The lady that I worked with, she was taking an eighth of a teaspoon of Progest-E three times a day.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 Has she had her thyroid hormones, including reverse T3, measured?

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 No.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 When someone is resistant to progesterone and needs extremely large amounts of it to feel right,

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 it's usually because their liver is letting estrogen and the excitatory things accumulate.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 So it takes a super normal amount of progesterone to steady things.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 And if you eat the things that your liver needs, not too much of some proteins,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 which contain the excitatory cysteine and so on, but for example, gelatin or glycine as an additive,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 shifting the balance away from the excitatory proteins towards more sugar or orange juice, for example,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 and making sure that your thyroid is letting your liver use the proteins efficiently to store sugar

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 and to eliminate the excitatory estrogen and other things.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 I had another question.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 Go ahead.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 My hands, within the last six months, my hands have started to shake.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 Whenever I write with a pen, I have jerk moments, jerky movements.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 I'm not smooth anymore. When I just relax my hand, it doesn't shake.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 How quickly or slowly did it come on?

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 It's gradual.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 Over what period of time?

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 Six months ago.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 Six months ago.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 Okay.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 So, Dr. Peat, in terms of handwriting, changes in handwriting,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 well, actually, let me ask you first this.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 Do you have a fine tremor or a coarse tremor?

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 Do you notice if you put your hands out in front of you,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 whether you visibly see any shaking or your hands by your side?

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 Yeah, it's a very fine tremor.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 Very fine. Okay.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 And had you noticed this tremor before you noticed your handwriting change

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 or was your handwriting the clue?

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 I was holding a book in my hand, and I noticed it that way.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 Yeah. Okay.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 Dr. Peat, in terms of excitation or muscular excitation, contraction, and tremors,

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 what do you think about when you think about that physiologically?

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Vitamins and minerals are the first things I think of.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 I've known people who had what they thought was Parkinson's disease,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 and all they needed was, in one case, vitamin B12, did it immediately.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 Other people, magnesium supplements have a sudden, steadying effect.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 Antitremors, sometimes more calcium and vitamin D will do it.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 All of these are antagonizing the excitotoxicity and that effect.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 They're anti-inflammatories.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 Yeah.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 And pregnenolone is always protective.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 Whenever you're under stress, you tend to use your steadying, quieting steroids faster.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 And sometimes just a supplement of pregnenolone can quiet things.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 And, Caller, did you take most of that down?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 Yeah. I'm going to actually listen to the broadcast afterwards.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 I have one other question.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 Alpha lipoic acid, my daughter wanted me to ask about that.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 Right.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 Dr. Peat, what do you think of the sulfur-containing lipoic acid?

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 I think it's one of the safer things, experimentally at least.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 Do you know what it does?

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 In small amounts, I think it's safe to experiment with it.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 And what would it be used for, though?

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 It is supposed to keep your glucose metabolism efficient.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 Biotin and lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, and various B vitamins work together.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 I'm sure there's some component of energy production in it, too,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 because I noticed that in fitness and bodybuilding,

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 that seems to be one of the many components that they advocate for,

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 a supplement stack, if you want to call it that.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 I have one other question, if you don't mind.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 No, I don't mind at all, but we do have two more callers after you, so go ahead.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 Real quick, Dr. Peat, you said that when you have higher T3, it can lower T4.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 Well, if you're under stress, your reverse T3 goes up under the influence of cortisol.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 And if you lower cortisol, your reverse T3 just naturally goes down.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 But everything that helps to lower cortisol will help to free up the normal T3 production

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 without reverse T3, and things that can help include sugar and aspirin and B vitamins and minerals.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 Thank you very much.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 All right, thank you for your calls.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 Okay, so we have two more callers, so let's take this next caller.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 I'm from Eureka, and my question is, can cannabis assist with epilepsy,

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 or do you know anyone who has used cannabis with epilepsy, and what's your overall view on cannabis?

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 I would automatically be a little bit skeptical about cannabis for epilepsy due to its estrogenic compounds,

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 but I'll let Dr. Peat comment more on that.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 Yeah, some people think it soothes the symptoms, but again, I think it's good to be cautious,

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 especially if it's used in any crude form that might have other plant components in it that could be irritating.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 All right, thanks for your call.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 We've got two more here still, so let's take the next caller.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 Caller, your question, and where are you from?

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 My name's Robin.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 I'm from Trinidad, and I'm interested.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 I like Stevia a lot.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 It's the only sweetener I'm using right now, and I've heard a little bit about maybe going to just like some of the other more artificial sweeteners,

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 and I'm wondering if it has the same issue.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 Dr. Peat, what do you think of Stevia as opposed to some of the other artificial sweeteners in terms of its safety or its allergenicity?

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:53.000
 Oh, I've never heard of serious allergic reactions to it.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 It seems to be fairly harmless.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 And caller, what was the main reason that you were using a sweetener like Stevia rather than sugar?

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 I have Candida, and so I'm not wanting to eat it, but maybe it takes Stevia as an issue in Candida.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 Oh, she said she has Candida.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 Oh, oh, well, Candida thrives when you're lacking some of the membrane surface antibodies, IgA,

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 and those depend on many things, but especially thyroid and progesterone.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 So if you're low thyroid, you will both have a problem regulating your blood glucose,

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 and your immune system will tend to favor things like Candida overgrowth,

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 but other bacteria too can produce similar symptoms.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 And so if you starve Candida thoroughly by cutting off all of its sugar supply, it needs glucose,

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 and so it can put out filaments and actually become invasive when you're not feeding it sugar.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:22.000
 And if you do have Candida in your intestine and you keep it well fed on glucose,

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 it's not going to invade and become deadly, but the worst it does then is to maybe make too much ethyl alcohol.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 But it can be eradicated pretty easily just with a little, very small amount of flowers of sulfur,

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 just 200 milligrams or so two or three days in a row will typically clean up the intestine from Candida

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 and other harmful fungus and bacteria.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 And that's available at pharmacies over the counter, also called sublimed sulfur.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 It's called what sulfur?

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 Either flowers of sulfur, that's easier to remember, or sublimed sulfur.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 And sometimes precipitated sulfur.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 Precipitation.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 It doesn't work if it's ground from crystals.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 So you're saying don't do the Candida diet, because I'm doing one with some carbs in it,

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000
 like basically I'm having sweet potatoes.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 Coconut flowers cannot get ketosis, but you're saying don't even bother with that.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 Yeah, I think the main rationale for the approach to treating your Candida is that if you actually starve yourself of glucose,

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 you're probably going to put yourself at a disadvantage because you will,

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 by necessity of starving Candida from glucose, you'll cause it to invade tissues more thoroughly

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
 to seek out sources of carbohydrate or other glucose stores.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 And actually you really want to just keep a normal diet and don't avoid and restrict sugar intake.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 But then if you use something as simple as flowers of sulfur,

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 and I think Dr. Peat said 200 milligrams a day for two to three days works pretty effectively.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 Which is just like a pinch, a large pinch.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 And things such as carrot salad, shredded carrots with a little olive oil and vinegar and salt,

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 the oil suppresses Candida multiplication,

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:45.000
 and the carrot has antifungal substances naturally because it grows in the ground and has to avoid being --

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 Resists digestion.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 Yeah, I'm eating a lot of carrots.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000
 I'm eating all those things.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 Did you say vinegar too, though?

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 Well, yeah, and it has to be raw carrot.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 Right.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
 Otherwise it will be a food source for bacteria.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 Okay, we do have another caller, so thanks for your call.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 Let's take this next caller.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 Thank you.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
 Honeydew.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 Honeydew. Okay, what's your call, caller? What's your question? Sorry.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 Yeah, I'd like to know what is the safe hormone for a person that's transitioning to a trans female.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 Well, progesterone is feminizing.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 If it's in large amounts, it antagonizes the effects of testosterone.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 In France, there were studies 40 years ago in which women with whiskers, mustache, and sideburns,

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 and chest hair applied progesterone topically, and in two or three months, I think it was,

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 they feminized their facial hair.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 And when a man takes just a moderate amount of progesterone orally,

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 it stops the whisker growing or slows it greatly.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 And those French studies showed that it would reverse the differentiated masculine type of bristly hair.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 And it's safe for men or women, unlike the estrogen that they use to produce breasts.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 What would be the dose of progesterone?

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000
 It's an individual matter.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 The quality of your thyroid function and your diet and liver and so on affect your response to it.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.000
 It's important to make sure that your thyroid is good.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:12.000
 A low thyroid person can increase the risk of cancer if they use anything estrogenic.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 So what tests should be done?

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 What tests?

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000
 Yeah, to determine the dosage.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:33.000
 Oh, well, if you're wanting to reverse hair growth, you can use it topically and just watch for the effects.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 Uh-huh. And systemically?

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 Oh, it's safe at several milligrams per day.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:52.000
 I've experimented with it and saw that I didn't have to shave for a day if I took around 10 milligrams.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 All right, well, let's keep it there.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 Let's call that question answered.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 It is just coming up to three minutes to the top of the hour.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 We're done at 8 o'clock, so thank you, callers that have listened in.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 Like I said earlier on, anybody caught part of the show or wants to listen to it again,

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 KMUD has an audio archive that allows you just to go to the website www.kmud.org

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:26.000
 and then go to audio archives, Friday Night Live, and select the calendar third Friday of the month from the list.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000
 And those are the shows that are recorded from 7 to 8 p.m.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
 Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peat.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 Let me let people know how to get a hold of you and find out more about you.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 Thank you, Dr. Peat. Good night.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
 Good night.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 Okay, so for those folks who've just listened to Dr. Peat for the first time

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 or those people that follow him closely, I know he's got a pretty big fan club going

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.000
 and a big old Facebook page that he's even completely unaware of.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 But if people want to go to his website, it's www.rayPeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-E-T.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000
 There's lots of fully referenced articles available on his website.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000
 And he's extremely well-versed in his subject,

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000
 so I encourage you to take full note of what he says and read what he has.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 He's not selling anything, and he's not seeking to gain political control or anything like that.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:20.000
 He is aware of it. We have told him about these fan club pages that people put up about it.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 He's never looked at it.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
 He's not associated with any of them.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 He's not at all social media relevant.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000
 Anyway, so thanks to those people that have called in tonight.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.000
 As always, it's a pleasure to receive calls,

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000
 and I know Dr. Peat gets pretty stimulated by people calling about different subjects,

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 even if it's off topic.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.000
 So until the third Friday of next month, I wish you good night.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
 Good night. Thank you for listening.
