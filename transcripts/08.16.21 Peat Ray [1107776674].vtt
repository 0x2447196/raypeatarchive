00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Broadcasting from the beautiful Hill Country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Alrighty, very pleasant good morning to you. It's almost afternoon here, OneRadioNetwork.com

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 And this would be a Monday, the 16th of August. Patrick Timpone is my name, and the fellow

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 to your immediate left, the picture there is Dr. Ray Peat. He's here on the third Monday

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 of every month, around 11.30, but we're just a little bit late because of, oh, some technical

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 silly stuff that's been going on. But Ray Peat's a good one. He's very popular around here.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 He's a PhD in biology, way back when, University of Oregon. And he specialized in physiology

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.500
 and the schools he taught at included the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:16.000
 State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, Universidad de Veracruzanza in Mexico.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 And he started his work with progesterone and related hormones in 1968, about the time

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 I started in radio, in '68. So he goes way back into physiological chemistry and physics

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 and dissertation, University of Oregon in '72, his ideas regarding progesterone and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 hormones closely related to it. So he probably knows as much about progesterone and hormones

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 as anybody on planet Earth these days, and it's an honor to have him here. Dr. Ray Peat,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 thanks for your patience in coming on this morning. We had a little thing. How are you,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 sir?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Oh, very good.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 You behaving yourself? Everything good there?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Yeah, we had two or three days of smoke from the fires to the east and south, but it's

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 cleared up now, so it's very, very nice.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 So you're up there in Oregon, right? In Oregon?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Yeah.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Dr. Peat, I've been thinking about this idea of variants and mutants and stuff. So let

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 me just tell folks, if you'd like to ask a question, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com. So

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Dr. Ray Peat, if in fact there is a virus running around, forget the germ theory thing,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 but just say there is some kind of a physical virus that people are exchanging with one

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 another. Let's take that as a premise. Do these, if they exist as they claim, Dr. Peat,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 do viruses mutate and have variants and get stronger or weaker? What's your understanding

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 of how this works?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Yeah, for about 80 years, they were trying to make vaccines against the common cold,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 most of which were coronaviruses. And the problem was as soon as they would get a vaccine

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 that would make you immune to the cold you had last season, the virus would change enough

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 that the vaccine didn't work. And so for all of these years, they were having failures

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 making vaccines that worked against coronaviruses. And someone came up with the idea that if

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 you made the crucially toxic part of a coronavirus and had your own body make that, that would

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 supposedly make you stay immune to some part of any virus of that family, no matter how

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 the rest of it changed. But that just isn't the way the immune system works. We do make

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 antibodies against everything, all the different parts, even the little piece of RNA they picked

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 out. Our bodies make a variety of antibodies. Supposedly, if it's pure, they would make

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 a certain range of antibodies. But that's only an extremely trivial, superficial part

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 of the immune system. The reason medical immunology got stuck on the idea that antibodies are

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 immunity is that the drug industry, Paul Ehrlich and his first mercury and then arsenic treatments

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 of syphilis were at the basis of, he called it the magic bullet. His theory of why his

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 patent medicine would kill a disease such as syphilis was that it was specific, absolutely

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 specific, a magic bullet that was only going to kill that organism and not hurt the rest

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 of your body. But of course, arsenic and mercury hurt everything, nothing specific or focused

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 about it, but it was his advertising campaign. The magic bullet is not only his patent medicine,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 but he sold the idea that our immune systems work that way, that our antibodies are like

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 magic bullets that only attack one particular thing, the invading organism. But he shared

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 the Nobel Prize with an actual biologist who studied the ground level of the immune system,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 and he said, "You know, I've been studying the phagocytes, which really think of the

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 invading material as potential food, but their real job is to maintain the continuity and

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 health of the organism, and they scrape up the invaders as part of their job of keeping

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 the organism healthy." But anyway, the money was behind Paul Ehrlich's magic bullet idea,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 and that took off in medicine. We had magic bullet antibodies, which were the immune system,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 and propagating it through medical schools supported by drug industry money wasn't enough.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 He drove the concept by a series of Nobel Prizes to any sort of junk science that supported

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 the idea of specific antibodies as the essence of our immune system. So that stupid idea

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 to sell mercury and arsenic drugs, Paul Ehrlich's, got taken up all the way up to the Nobel Prize

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 committee.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 So oftentimes they give a Nobel Prize to run out a particular meme that they want.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Always, I would say, with rare exceptions.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 Well, didn't Cary Mullis get a Nobel Prize for the PCR test?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Yeah, that was so valuable to the industry. They thought he was a harmless crank.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 So let me go back on the cold idea. So is it possible, though, that as many are now

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 out there talking about the Lanka, the Cowans, and many people, that colds and flus are simply

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 a detoxification process and that we're not catching some kind of a virus floating

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 through the air? I mean, do you think that's possible?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 No. There's this other idea of detoxification. That's another medical industry trick

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 that goes back hundreds of years. The doctor would give you a poisonous toxin, a poisonous

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 remedy, and you would get sick when you took your mercury diuretic, for example. And the

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 medical story was you got sick. That's your body healing itself, throwing out the evil

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 substance that's making you sick. So you get sicker before you get better.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 Which is the detox model, right?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Yeah, and it really hit its peak with the Herxheimer reaction, where in treating syphilis

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 they would almost kill you with mercury fumes. You would just fall apart. And they would

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 say, "That's the healing reaction. You're detoxifying." But it was 100 percent the poison

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 that they were giving you. And they said, "It's the germs dying and throwing off their

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 toxins." Or, "It's your body destroying the tumor, for example, and you're suffering the

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 detoxifying effect of getting that poisonous tumor or germs out of your body." But basically

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 that Herxheimer reaction is just an old medical trick to say, "We'll get you well, but you

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 have to get sick first."

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 So then you are of the mind that there is somewhere a unique communicable, potentially

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 -- well, the numbers aren't there for like .04 percent -- but you think that there is

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 some kind of virus called corona that is floating around that people are getting sick from?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Oh, yeah. They were working on that 80 years ago, but they didn't have electron micrograph

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 images of it to show that it had the corona attachments all around it, of the attachment

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 proteins. But it was an androgenically recognizable family of viruses.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 The detoxifying idea has been put to the test in various ways. When cows are rounded up

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 to be slaughtered, they check the toxins, pesticides and things, in their urine and

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 their bloodstream. Some of these studies found that essentially 100 percent of them had circulating

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 toxins in their blood or urine. If they would stop poisoning them for just a day or two

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 when they were slaughtered, they found that the liver had none of the toxins, and that

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 the toxins were residing in the fat tissue mostly, somewhat in the muscle tissue. But

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 the liver, as the organ of detoxification, was essentially 100 percent clean in these

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 well-poisoned animals. If you just reduced the inflow of poison, the liver was passively

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 working on expelling it from the body, putting it out in the urine.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 And what were they poisoning them with?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 The herbicides and insecticides, things that are used in producing their food and keeping

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 insects off their skin and so on.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Well, isn't it possible, though, that then we could be poisoning ourselves with different

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 things, chemicals and bad food and bad thinking, to create the flu and the cold?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 Oh, those things all contribute. The environment is full of toxic junk, varying as industry

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 finds new poisons to sell. So those are factors in everything. But the type of cold or flu

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 going around has statistical properties. A certain type will predominate in a large part

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 of the people in a certain flu season. The next flu season, it will be slightly different.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 So is it possible, though, that these things that are circling around are in fact exosomes

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 that are created in the body that people are sharing?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 Oh, sure, sure. That's where woodpeckers come from.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 Well, see, that's what I'm thinking. I mean, where else would they come from? They

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 have to come from us, right?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 Yes, or other higher organisms. A virus doesn't just make itself. It's structured.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 So what would be another higher organism?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Oh, well, the standard theory is bats and pigs and monkeys and all sorts of animals

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 that are under stress are going to be putting out more of their exosomes or viruses. But

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 it depends on how those stressed animals interact. A stressed pig farm, for example, is a powerful

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 source of exosomes or so-called pig viruses.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 So exosomes and viruses are the same thing, essentially?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 Well, no one has suggested a better explanation for where they come from.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Yeah, how can a virus originate without the elaborate organisms that have the machinery

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 for constructing these little encapsulated bits of nucleic acid?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 So we're sharing these exosomes and then people that are stressed out or poisoned or

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 in fear or whatever, they can have a reaction to the exosomes that we're sharing.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Yeah. So a person who falls down the stairs, for example, is going to have damaged tissues

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 and will put out an alarm to make exosomes for all kinds of things. So some of the cold

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 or influenza-like exosomes might have been sitting around harmlessly that they picked

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 up, maybe even in a previous season. But with the trauma that loosens things up, then among

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 many different, hundreds of different exosome types that the trauma brings on, then they

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 might bring up influenza or herpes or...

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Whatever, right. So then the whole vaccine idea has kind of just done some work. I mean,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 how would they protect Ray Peat from Patrick's exosomes if you and I had lunch or something?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Make sure you eat a good lunch, well-nourished, have a glass of milk and a little coffee and

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 orange juice.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 God, so there's so... Man, it's just so fascinating what's going on here. So the idea that there

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 is a COVID-19 thing and now it's changing and it's something else called a delta, that

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 just doesn't fly, does it? I mean, it doesn't work, does it?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 Well, there are thousands of variations. You can start giving them names. I think, how

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 can you even test for something that's changing so fast? If they have five major variants

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 now with their different names, who's testing to see if one of those is making you sick

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 or not?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 Yeah, and then to create a vaccine for that would be just... I mean, it's just incomprehensible,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 isn't it?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Yeah, but even once you accept the idea that a vaccine can prevent one particular kind

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 of influenza, for example, there were several studies a couple of years ago looking at people

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 who were vaccinated for influenza the previous season and this season when they got a respiratory

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 infection, they checked for what type of pathogen was present and they found there were fewer

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 people with the influenza pathogen, but many more with the coronavirus causing their respiratory

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 disease. So it's been known, well documented a couple of years ago, but it's been known

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 for decades that every time you activate your immune system, you are narrowing its range.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 Just on the level of antibodies, people don't realize that when you say you introduce a

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 piece of ground up slurry of pork roast and produce antibodies to pork roast, those antibodies

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 circulate in your body and the same thing that recognized the pork roast recognizes

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 your new antibodies to pork roast and will produce antibodies to those, and those are

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 something that wasn't there before. You'll produce antibodies to those. So every time

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 you produce antibodies, you don't just stop with those antigen antibodies, but you create

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 waves of reactions forming antibodies to the antibodies and antibodies to those. Just the

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 antibody people have a grossly fantasy-based idea of what they're doing. You're disrupting

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 the system far down the line in somewhat unpredictable ways, but you're occupying that part of your

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 immunity and draining energy and potential, developmental potential of your whole organism

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 is being drained down into that chain of antibody reactions.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 It's August 16th. Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com. We're talking with PhD Dr. Ray Peat. So let's

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 see. So all mammals, we're all producing exosomes in our body and we're always breathing

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 them out and breathing them in and everybody's sharing them?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 Yeah.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 Kind of?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 Yeah.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 And the purpose of that is to what? Why did God and nature, why are we doing this?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 It's probably some sort of a biological cooperative self-sustaining and balancing ecological process.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 An ecosystem, the ecosystem achieves some stability, meaning that your environment is

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 being detected not just through what eats what, but through what subtly modifies.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 Each organism, if we modify it a little bit, it's almost like a genetic update that we

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 share with each other.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 Yeah, a complex sensing of your environment, not just what you ate for breakfast.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 So do you think this is how the species evolved this far? We've been doing this for a million

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 years?

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 Yeah. Since the 1940s and 50s, people have been seeing this sharing of genes horizontally

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 as a very powerful part of evolution and maintenance of our physiology and ecosystems.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 So allopathic medicine went wrong when Pasteur cooked the books and developed the idea that

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 these viruses come from somewhere else and we needed to kill them?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 Oh, basically, yeah. That idea that it's all reducible to one pathogen, or the pathogen

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 is always just part of a complex ecological process. For example, if you don't have enough

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 food, then the dirt in your environment is going to become a potential pathogen.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Then why do some people get flu symptoms once a year or whatever, or cold symptoms? What's

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 the difference between those that do and those that don't?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Partly there's a tough period when the immune system is being adjusted and the farther out

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 of a balanced society and ecosystem we are, the harder those challenges are. So probably

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 there were cultures and societies in which people didn't even notice having childhood

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 sicknesses. But then for several generations, the childhood sicknesses took care of most

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 of the epidemics and those things got more specialized and deranged than those things

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 that were managed in a subtle way, more or less unnoticed. Those things started creating

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 bigger imbalances of epidemics and then you would get a childhood disease that would run

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 its course for two or three generations and then fade out. All of the famous childhood

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 diseases that existed in the period of vaccinology, they had all run their statistical course

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 rising, peaking, fading away to almost nothing by the time the vaccines came in. Then the

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 vaccines took credit for the natural history of our adjustment to our environment.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 So even polio virus, people argue, that it wasn't some obscure virus that just appeared

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 and made people sick, that it was all about people getting poisoning, I think, with DDT

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 and other things.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Yeah, that besides the fact that the hypodermic needle was invented a couple hundred years

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 ago and doctors found that they could more easily monopolize drug treatments instead

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 of making a tea out of your drugs. They would make a potion and then inject it into you.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 So medicine took over the idea of treating by injection and the paralytic polio, if you

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 can find on the internet, a lot of good historical articles showing no matter what the doctors

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 were injecting, the paralytic polio would concentrate on whichever part of the body

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 received the injection. Even injected vitamins would predispose that arm or leg to become

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 paralyzed.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 So if you were perfectly healthy, I mean the most healthy person on the planet, and you

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 breathed in some exosomes from me that, I don't know, that I was trying to update

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 your genome, I mean, you couldn't die from it, right?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 No, no, I don't worry about the epidemics and especially COVID.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 I haven't had a cold for, I don't remember how long the last time was, 40 years maybe.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 Same here with me. So then the whole COVID thing was really just made up, the idea of

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 COVID-19, it was just made up.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Yeah, there are several very good investigators with an hour or more explanation on the internet

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 David Martin, as one goes into the history, Michael Yeadon, very recently had an hour

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 full interview in which he dissects the official story, shows that no part of the official

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 pandemic story and vaccine story has any basis in fact. Absolutely no part of it is what

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 they say it is.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 So if you wanted to not get a genetic update from one another, would a mask block those

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 exosomes?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 Very slightly.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 But why would you or don't we need the updates from everybody?

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Basically, it's beneficial to get your little exosome updates.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 So then, so the whole vaccine thing from day one is just not right.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 Yeah, all the way back, the one vaccine that was used for hundreds or thousands of years

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 turned out to be used in an organized way, the smallpox vaccine, finally having eradicated

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 it in most of the countries of the world, they finally got together and used the vaccine

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 in an intelligent way, finding outbreaks, closing in, encircling those outbreaks and

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 using the vaccination only in those areas until there was no more smallpox left in the

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 world.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 But that wasn't at all good for the vaccine industry.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 There was no more need for a smallpox vaccine when they used it intelligently to eliminate

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 that particular strain of the problem.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 So where did this smallpox molecule come from?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 It had to come from humans at some point, right?

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 From cows.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 From cows.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 Wow.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 So do you think that somebody could create some kind of a make-believe virus in a lab,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 you know, the whole China-Wuhan thing, somehow release it in the air, I don't know, and

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 then people could share it?

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 Is that possible?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 It doesn't sound illogical, does it?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 I mean...

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 The U.S. Department of Defense, they adopted the biological toxin researchers, both from

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 Japan and Nazi Germany at the end of the war, or even during the war, and created their

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 own ongoing biological warfare lab, which nominally Richard Nixon terminated with destruction

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 of the germ warfare material, supposedly in 1969.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 But through the 1940s, for example, the army in Boston in particular, and Fort Detrick,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 and two or three test sites around the country, they were testing aerosols of many different

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 organisms, including the potential of aerosolizing polio.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 And one of the people working on that project became paralyzed and dropped out of the military

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 program of aerosol germ research, and went back to the University of Mississippi to teach

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 medicine, and wrote the most famous, extremely ignorant physiology textbook, A.C. Guyton,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 the most famous medical book in history.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 But he turned to textbook writing because he was unable to continue his work in germ

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 warfare research.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 But that was the business for 20 or 30 years of our government, creating aerosols to see

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 how effective it was to spread, disabling bacteria and viruses and other things.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 Was it deemed to be effective?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 I mean, do they live out there floating around?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 No, they weren't controllable enough.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 The ones that were really put to use were the crop diseases, fungus, for example, to

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 destroy crops in the country you wanted to knock out.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 Oh, if you want to kill somebody's crop that you were one of your enemies.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 Yeah.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 So to really get something poisonous in your body, you almost have to get it injected.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 Or in your food.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Or in your food.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 Eat it.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Take it in.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 Take it in.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 They have carcinogenic bacteria, for example, that are a combination of a viral nucleic acid

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 and the bacteria to make it spreadable through food so it can give you cancer of the digestive

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 system very quickly and predictably.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 So that's a little poison that you have to ingest.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 Yeah.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 Those have been put to use at least as attempted assassination tools.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 If I epatrachate one of those guys, could I breathe it out and share it with somebody

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 else through the air?

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 That particular bacteria, I think, was not very spreadable through the air.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 So the whole China virus, Wuhan thing, is there any there there?

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 Well, the intent was there.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 We know what Ralph Berrick was doing in Fort Dedrick, at least on the surface, the things

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 he admitted.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 And what he admitted are horrendously criminal.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 And so you have to wonder if classified things might not have been even worse than designing

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 viruses intended to attack humans.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 Things that you took out of bats and modified, added parts of other genetic material and

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 engineered the genes until they were able to infect human beings.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 That's what Ralph Berrick's contribution idea was.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 But we haven't really seen any evidence, have we, Dr. Peat, of using Koch's postulates

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 or autopsies, you know, proving that something has killed people during this whole COVID

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 thing the last two years?

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 No.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 When someone dies, you can test their lungs or blood, and you can often find several different

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 things that are potentially harmful enough to contribute to their death.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 Sometimes you can't find any cause of the influenza-like condition.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 Sometimes it's because your intestine, under stress, leaked toxins, and it's simply the

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 bacterial toxins from your own intestine that killed you and created influenza-like symptoms.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 So if a person is dying from stress and endotoxemia, and you happen to find some of the COVID organisms

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 in their nose, for example, you can't say that that was the cause of death when there

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 are so many other unexamined potential causes.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 But running with the whole exosome idea, and then some people are getting their exosome

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 genetic update, and they have a lot of comorbidities, and their terrain is poisoned, they could

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 really get sick, potentially die, right?

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 Yeah.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 Would this be a form of kind of natural selection kind of thing, where the weak survive?

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 Where the weak survive?

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 I mean, where the strong survive.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 Oh, yeah, I suppose.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 As people age, in our present types of environment, we accumulate things that weaken our resistance

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 in general.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 Yes.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 Not just the immune system, but all of our adaptive things.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 Yes.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 Polyunsaturated fats and iron happen to, each one triggers in different ways our attempt

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 to adapt and survive.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 But those attempts to adapt and survive cause us to take up more of the iron and PUFA into

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 our systems, and so it becomes a self-propelling decay process, just because of the nature

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 of our defensive reactions interacting with the environments that provide too much iron

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 and too much PUFA.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 Kind of the classic model for aging in planet Earth these days.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 Yeah.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 That seems to be it.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 Thank you.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 Dr. Ray P. Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 What do you think?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 We're going to get to your questions now, and it's an honor to be here with you.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 It's 16 August 2021 on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 We've known Daniel Vitalis for about 12 years or so.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 He has a great company called Sir Thrival.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 One of his products is kind of the flagship product, the Pine Pollen, and it's on sale

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 for the next couple of weeks or so.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 If you use promo code RESTORE20, 20% off on all Pine Pollen products.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 And here's Daniel to give you a little heads up on some insights into this wonderful product.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 The first supplement I like to take in the morning right after I wake up is Pine Pollen

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 Pure Potency, or P4.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 This is Sir Thrival's flagship testosterone and androgen support formula.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 It's made with the pollen of pine trees, which is rich in testosterone, androstenedione,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 DHEA, and a bunch of plant sterols.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 These are all substances, phytochemicals, that support the body's natural androgens

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 or male hormones.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 Of course, men and women are using this product, but usually it's men in andropause.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 Men after age 40 whose testosterone production has started to decline.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 Many of Sir Thrival's supplements can be taken any time of day, but Pine Pollen Pure Potency,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 it's important that you take at very specific times of the day.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 Now it can be taken once, twice, or three times, depending on how much you want to supplement

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 yourself with the phytoandrogens found in it.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 But the key is taking it at morning, right upon waking, midday or noon, and then again

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 right before bed.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 So once, twice, or three times a day, but always at those times.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 And that's because that's when your body's naturally producing its own testosterone.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 And all we want to do is amplify that sign wave.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 We don't want to start to take testosterone at a time where our body's purged it from

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 the bloodstream.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 Instead, we want to take it at a time where those levels are already spiking and we're

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 just subtly helping to increase them.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 This product tastes fantastic.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 I think of it like an orange creamsicle, and that's because in addition to that subtle

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 pine flavor, there's a little bit of orange peel, Tahitian vanilla bean, cloves, and then

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 a little bit of maple syrup just to give it this nice kind of sweet orange flavor.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 So it's really delicious and easy to take.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 So if you're looking to increase your testosterone or androgen levels, and you want an alternative

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 to pharmaceutical testosterone replacement therapies, there's nothing that does it better

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 than Pine Pollen Pure Potency.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 Pine Pollen Pure Potency, that's my fave.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 I ordered three bottles of these guys and just received them a couple of days ago.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 You can get a little three-pack and I think you get a deal there, or you can sign up for

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 AutoShip, and that's a fun way to do it.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 Dr. Peat has talked about it'd be good for all of us to take a little bit of vitamin

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 D3.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 By the way, the Pine Pollen, again, I want to mention promo code, "RESTORE20," 20% off

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 for the next couple of weeks.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 This is a wonderful product, vitamin D3K2 product.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 Vitamin D3K2.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 Check out the ingredients.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 It's sourced from lanolin, natto, suspended in olive oil.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 It's a proprietary blend of aloe vera, leaf, goji fruit, shilajit, and flavored with peppermint.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 I mean, is that cool or what?

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 You know, I mean, come on.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 How about that for ingredients?

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 So it's vitamin D3K2 and with these lights I can't really see, but I think it's just,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 I think one drop, two drops give you, again, I can't see if I put on my, put on my, my

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 pinhole glasses.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 I got these lights, make you crazy.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 I wanted to tell you what you get here on the, on the thing.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 Yeah, one serving, two drops, wow, that's four, almost 5,000 units, just two drops,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 5,000 units a day.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 Don't you love pinhole glasses?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 Like, like Stevie Wonder.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 So it's pretty cool.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 Just two drops, 5,000 units, which is probably all you could, all you need.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 I think that's what, I'll come back and I'll ask him.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 I think that's what Dr. Peat suggests.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 It's a pretty good thing to do.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 So check it out.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 good stuff, all in myron glass, great product.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 We've known Daniel for a long time, so it's the real deal.

 So check it out right now on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 Have you heard about hydrogen, baby?

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 This conversation goes back seven years with Dr. Patrick Flanagan.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 Listen.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 And then I discovered that HUNZA water also contained negative ionized hydrogen,

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 which is a source of biological electrons.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 When we're young, we have enzymes in our body called dehydrogenase.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 And the purpose of dehydrogenase is to lift off hydrogen ions from the foods we eat.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 And their purpose is to create NADH, which is a chemical that acts as a shuttle in the mitochondria

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 for producing all the energy in our body, adenosine triphosphate.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 And when people take this, it causes DNA repair.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 It heals the body from all kinds of oxygen-free radicals.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 It also helps the body recover from damage from radiation.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 Well, we certainly want some of this stuff, right?

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000

 From the Hill Country in Texas, broadcasting worldwide, this is OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 I'm talking with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 Dr. Flanagan has to say about this.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 Oh, we can get Dr. Peat's newsletter.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 It's rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 Plural, rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 So before we go to the questions, I'm curious, you see some of these old kind of historical,

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 you know, Jane Austen kind of shows, Dr. Peat.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 And oftentimes the characters will, you know, get ill or flu or colds when they get weather changes

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 and they get chilled and things like that.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 So can you explain why that is?

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 Yeah, I'm sure it's all suggestion.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 In Mexico, especially in the 1950s and 60s, it was still a very powerful thing.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 I knew people who were perfectly healthy, but while they were taking a shower,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 the hot water would run out and they would get a brief episode of cold water

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 and they would immediately get cold symptoms.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 Eating a cold popsicle, for example, was reputed to bring on the cold.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 Just sucking on a piece of ice, people were conditioned to believe that just because of the concept of cold.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 You would get a cold or flu or something.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 Yeah, and so there was a fear of night air.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 Women, they would keep the windows closed on a bus even when it was too hot inside.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 And women in the evening would put their ribosome around their mouth,

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 covering up their mouth and nose so they didn't breathe the cool night air.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 So it was mostly a mind thing, mostly a suggestion.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 I'm convinced of that.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 Wow. Before we go to the emails, I want to ask you about ivermectin.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 Years ago, Dr. Ray Peat, we talked with a lady by the name of Kerry Rivera,

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 who was in Mexico, and I think it was 12 years ago when we first heard about ivermectin.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 And she was having great success with giving the autistic kids ivermectin.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 And she said it was because it was getting rid of parasites.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 Wow. What do you make of all of the people that have some kind of symptoms that they think is COVID,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 taking ivermectin and feeling better?

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000
 It's also anti-inflammatory.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 And hydroxychloroquine, it's slightly anti-inflammatory.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 Everything that helps, I think, really is correcting the basic problem of that type of infection,

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:20.000
 which is inflammation leading to fibrosis.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 And if those are extreme, leading to clotting, inflammation and clotting in the long run promote fibrosis.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 But when we do an anti-inflammatory like ivermectin or turmeric and other things,

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 isn't inflammation a symptom of a deeper cause?

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 Why would getting rid of the inflammation, it doesn't get to the cause, does it?

00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 Yeah, basically the spike protein covers, if you have enough of it,

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 it covers up enough of our ACE2 enzymes, which are the anti-inflammatory part of the endotoxin system.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:23.000
 And so if you swamp our anti-inflammatory system,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 then you open the way for the intestine to leak endotoxin into the circulatory system,

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 leading to the activation of the enzymes that turn polyunsaturated fats into prostaglandins

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 that create the explosive storm of inflammatory materials.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 Hmm, wow, wow. So it's anti-inflammatory, you think that's why the ivermectin helps people feel better?

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 Yeah, aspirin, all of the safe, old anti-inflammatory drugs can have a radically curing effect.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:29.000
 And since coagulation problems lead to the stroke and various embolisms and heart problems and so on,

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:37.000
 also the anti-coagulation effect of aspirin following its anti-inflammatory action,

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:42.000
 those all contribute to knocking out the disease at its heart.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:50.000
 Since our last conversation a month ago, have you had any updates on what you've learned about these injections

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 and what's going on with them? Can you add anything further?

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 No, I don't think there's anything new, except the claim that people who were fully vaccinated

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 are now being reinfected by a different variant.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 I suspect that that's a way of covering up the harm done by the vaccine itself.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 If you have thousands and thousands of fully vaccinated people getting very sick,

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 you don't want to blame that lingering after-effects of sickness, you don't want to blame it on the vaccine.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 So you say the vaccine is just weak, that way you can sell a third vaccine.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 Yeah, Foshee's already talking about, you know, we're going to need these boosters for a long time to come.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 Yeah, about a year ago, people at Pfizer were saying, "Gee, if we could find a way to sell a third vaccine,

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 here's how many billion dollars we could make from a third one."

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 So they got the FDA to approve the idea of a third one, partly on the basis that the sick,

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:32.000
 vaccinated people are being reinfected because of the weakness of the vaccine,

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 rather than suffering the side effects of the vaccine.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 And we're seeing so many different videos out from nurses and doctors that are saying that the people that are sick are the vax,

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000
 not the unvax, as we're being told.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 And it's just hard to believe anything that you see out there these days.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 Yeah, if you look back right from the start of February of 2020, everything turns out to be a lie.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000
 Yeah, to make it all up.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 Well, let's get into some emails. Thanks for being here, as always, sir.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 This is Thomas. He's in Sweden. Wow.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 I managed to get my hands on some progesterone cream, which I've applied to my head and my neck, temples, and forehead a few weeks ago,

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 and I started to feel like there's been some real positive changes with my migraines that have been going on for a very long time.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 A little clear-headed.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 However, I've slowly started to get more and more problems with sensitive teeth and irritable gums,

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 and I haven't really changed anything else.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:53.000
 So I wonder if the progesterone cream could be the reason. And just in general, what does Dr. Peat suggest when it comes to these issues in my mouth?

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 So he took the progesterone cream, started to get relief from migraines, but now he's having some issues with his teeth and in his mouth.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 The problem with migraine starts at the nutritional and hormonal level,

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:29.000
 and sometimes just a dose or two of progesterone can activate your thyroid to the point that it regulates your digestive and nutritional processes

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000
 and takes care of the migraines permanently.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 Other times, the progesterone might be enough to alleviate the headache, but not to get your thyroid and digestion back on track.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 And so it's really important to look at problems in your diet and check your temperature and pulse.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:03.000
 And do some of your blood tests for TSH and vitamin D in particular.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 Your vitamin D, did you, have we heard you say about 5,000 units a day is good?

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 Yeah, that's a good one.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 Almost always in the long run, that's effective and not too much.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:28.000
 And how about dosage on the progesterone? Can you give a general idea of what people could start with, progesterone cream?

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 Yeah, 40 years ago, there were two times that I happened to have a full-blown migraine when I had progesterone at the end,

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:52.000
 and taking 100 milligrams of it, within two or three minutes, the headache totally disappeared.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:08.000
 And in one of those cases, I got the migraine from not realizing that the fluoridated water was knocking out my T3 thyroid supplement.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:16.000
 So watching my thyroid more carefully and my diet, I didn't need it anymore.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 But for a man, 100 milligrams of progesterone is a very powerful dose that will usually knock out even a migraine.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:41.000
 Women, if their estrogen is extremely high, sometimes won't get an effect from a dose as big as 100 milligrams.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:54.000
 For them, it's important to start correcting right at the foundation with your thyroid and your avoiding irritating foods.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:00.000
 And then ongoing though, for men and women, you're more in the 50 range or 25 milligrams?

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:12.000
 Yeah, daily 20 or 30 milligrams during the luteal phase of their cycle. That's considered a full replacement dose.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:25.000
 Similar with pregnenolone, about 20 or 30 milligrams per day for both men and women will help to keep the stress hormones down.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:32.000
 Here is Marion. Oh, Marion says, "I received it for many years and now I can't. How can I get it again?"

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:39.000
 Ray Peat's newsletter. So it's rayPeatsnewsletter.com, right? Gmail.com.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000
 Right, there's an S after the T.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000
 raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.000
 Okay. Here is a long-time listener. Thanks for having Dr. Peat on.

00:59:51.000 --> 01:00:00.000
 I'm 72, not seen a doctor in over 40 years. I'm seeking a solution to remedy prostate inflammation issues.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:09.000
 Have you historically, have you without giving medical advice, found a supplement that is really effective?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:16.000
 There are way too many best number one products out there to try. Best regards from Michael.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
 So, you know, prostate inflammation.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:35.000
 Yeah, working on your system in general to reduce inflammation. The first thing is to make sure you aren't going into a stress condition every night.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:52.000
 And keeping your blood sugar steady is essential for that. And you need good nutrition, plenty of calcium relative to phosphate, enough vitamin D to handle the calcium,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:10.000
 which keeps your energy system running, supporting the thyroid function. And the thyroid, vitamin D, and calcium are sort of a kernel of energy support substances

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:19.000
 that will steady your blood sugar and keep down the inflammatory processes in general.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:28.000
 So that's why you like orange juice and vitamin and milk because they're both calcium, high calcium?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:37.000
 Well, in the case of orange juice, there are many anti-inflammatory substances in the orange juice.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:02:01.000
 The potassium and sugar are a big part of reducing the inflammation, but these bioflavonoids of the orange are very powerful, reducing the inflammation caused by iron and plastic laminins, for example.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
 And how do we get to this too much iron? Where does it come from?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:29.000
 For example, meat, fish, shellfish, grains are fairly bad sources for iron, but mostly meat, fish, and shellfish.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:50.000
 One class of shellfish is very low in iron. The shrimp, crab, lobster, scallop, squid type are high in copper and low in iron.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:05.000
 So scallops have got a lot of copper rather than iron, so that's a good choice. They taste good too. But if you like fish, can you put something on the fish to balance out the high iron in them?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:14.000
 Having coffee with your meat or fish helps to block the absorption of the iron.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
 Really? What's in the coffee?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:43.000
 Partly it's the phosphate, but a lot of the polyphenols are similar to what's in orange juice. Tea and coffee have a group of chemicals that are very good for blocking iron absorption.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000
 Where do fish get all that iron? Just swimming around in the ocean, doc?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:04:04.000
 Yeah, if they have red blood, they have to have iron. And shellfish like squid and scallops...

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
 And lobster, they've got the blue blood, right?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
 Yeah, they have blue copper-based blood.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
 How about oysters?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:19.000
 They happen to accumulate very large amounts of iron as well as copper.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
 Oh, they do? So if you do these at night, they could disrupt sleep, right?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:51.000
 Yeah. All of the things that are potential excitants, the presence of iron risks excitatory excess and that facilitates the uptake of calcium, which is another excitation sustainer.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:03.000
 And together with aging, the tissues take up a mixture of calcium sulfate and iron.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:12.000
 Is there any other thing you could take other than coffee to balance the iron if you had to have fish at night?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:29.000
 The vegetable substances, some of the things in orange juice like ascorbic acid stimulate iron absorption.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:37.000
 The bioflavonoids, which you can get from many other fruits and vegetables, block iron absorption.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:47.000
 I see. Just learned my husband writes, "Vicky, who's 68, has type 2 diabetes with a sugar level of 199.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:54.000
 From your treatment experience, what can we do to get his levels back to normal without taking drugs?

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:01.000
 He doesn't eat sweets and he walks. But thanks for having Dr. Peat on your show."

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:11.000
 The things that reduce stress and inflammation help to get oxidation of sugar going.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:17.000
 And vitamin D and calcium are crucial in that.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
 Vitamin D and calcium to help reduce stress.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:33.000
 Working to keep your mitochondria responding to the thyroid hormone so that they can oxidize glucose.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
 Dr. Peat, thank you for being on the show.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:51.000
 So are you suggesting that I get my TSH level below 1 and keep upping my thyroid medication or my pig thyroid they're using until I get there?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:12.000
 There was one study in which they found in relation to their TSH scores, they found that the higher the TSH in the group was, the more risk of thyroid cancer they had.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:23.000
 And in a group completely without thyroid cancer, they were below 0.4 on the TSH scale.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:43.000
 And the areas that are supplemented with iodine, even the salt, the amount of iodine in salt is sometimes several times higher than our requirement for iodine.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:08:00.000
 And in those populations, thyroid disease and thyroid cancer is very seriously increased just from that slight chronic antithyroid effect of the chronic excess iodine.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
 So that's why you're not supported as long as I've talked to you.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
 I believe you don't like taking supplemental iodine at all.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
 You think it's unnecessary.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
 And dangerous.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
 And dangerous. Wow.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000
 And so what if we're doing this, I think it's just pure salt.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000
 I think it's the, what do they call it?

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
 You know what I mean? It's a Morton salt, but it's pickling and canning, right?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
 Oh yeah, that's what I use.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000
 That's what you use, yeah. So there's no iodine in there. There's a little, there's enough, but it's not too much?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:09:02.000
 Yeah, there were studies a few decades ago of the Americans' iodine intake, and because of the iodized salt and other use of iodine in food additives, there was essentially no iodine deficiency in the U.S., but lots of iodine excess.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
 Lots of excess, wow.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000
 I can remember the days when we used to talk to Dr. Hal Huggins, remember him?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
 Great guy with the mercury fillings and all that.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:25.000
 And he claimed that people that were on the pickling and canning had much better, he called them blood chemistries, over many years that he looked at, than people that are on sea salt and all these different salts.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
 Yeah, it's very clean stuff.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.000
 It's clean stuff, yeah. And it's cheap too. What is it, a buck and a half or two bucks for a big box of it?

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000
 Yeah, I think it's over two pounds for a really big box.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
 And so it's just pure salt, nothing else?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
 Yeah, yeah.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
 Wow.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:10:08.000
 Here's an email, "I'm a middle-aged guy with high fasting blood sugar and I start eating nutritious foods that are recommended by Dr. Peat and also supplements thyroid to increase the metabolic rate. What would happen to his fasting blood sugar level? Would it decrease to what it considered normal or would it stay elevated because high blood sugar has a protective function in middle and old age?"

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:19.000
 Let's see, what's he asking here? If a middle-aged guy with high fasting blood sugar starts eating nutritious foods recommended, hmm, do you know what he's asking?

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:43.000
 Well, as your body temperature goes up and your thyroid function and vitamin D go up, your parathyroid hormone goes down and parathyroid hormone is an antagonist to oxidative respiratory metabolism.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:55.000
 And so by suppressing your parathyroid hormone, you're freeing up your oxidative thyroid ability to oxidize glucose.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:12.000
 And so your body temperature is likely to increase under the influence of calcium, vitamin D and thyroid and getting enough salt is part of that, salting your food to taste.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:33.000
 And so your body temperature goes up and you're using the glucose, so it really doesn't matter very much what your average blood glucose is as long as you don't drop it too low.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:48.000
 So, what would be going on if your, say your body temperature was 98 in the morning, which seems reasonable and your TSH is still high? What would you go, how would you go from there?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:12:07.000
 Checking your temperature later in the day after eating and your pulse rate, lots of people will wake up with a 98 degree temperature and sometimes their pulse rate will be slower or fast.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:20.000
 But after eating a good breakfast, including plenty of carbohydrates, their temperature will often fall very low.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
 I've seen it go from 98 down to 96 by 11 o'clock in the morning.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:46.000
 And that means that their temperature at waking was held up by the stress hormones, mostly cortisol, sometimes a mixture of cortisol and adrenaline, which you can tell by the pulse rate as well as the temperature.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:13:06.000
 And then getting your blood sugar up by eating enough carbohydrate lowers the cortisol and/or adrenaline and you'll see that in the absence of stress, your body temperature is very low.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:14.000
 So, in an ideal world, our body temperature is around 98.6 all the time?

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:22.000
 No, it should drop low at 2 in the morning or so when you're deeply asleep.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:38.000
 But then it should quickly pop right up to 98.6 after breakfast and stay right in that vicinity, that's oral temperature, right up until around sunset when it starts dropping again.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:45.000
 Who was the fellow, Dr. Peat, that really did the whole Broda-Barnes?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:56.000
 I mean, he went through a whole thing where he didn't want you to move much and everything and just as quietly as possible get your awaking temperature.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.000
 But that's kind of counter indication of what you said about checking it after breakfast.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.000
 Oh yeah, he relied just on that one measurement.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:32.000
 I noticed in Eugene during a hot, humid summer, extremely hypothyroid people kept up a normal temperature all through the day just because the air was 90 degrees or so and even if they died, it would take them a while to cool off.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:43.000
 So you have to take into account the pulse rate and the effect of food and the time of day and look at the whole picture.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:57.000
 In all your experience over many years on the thyroid, which you've studied a lot, even in men and women, a pulse rate of what would be kind of like what you want to kind of look for, work your way towards?

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:13.000
 A healthy, youngish person at rest, anywhere between 18 and 40, it's good to have your resting pulse at 80 or 85.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
 Is that right? Wow.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000
 It's difficult for me to imagine that for myself because I'm at 60 all the time, you know.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:31.000
 But you think I could get to 80 as I get healthier or my thyroid gets healthier, but actually move up and I wouldn't feel all stressed out?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:45.000
 Yeah, when your TSH and your parathyroid hormone are both at the bottom of the scale, that means your cells are running autonomously at a higher rate.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
 At a higher energy level.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:16:00.000
 And so just sitting at rest, you're burning a lot of sugar and oxygen that will keep your temperature and pulse rate up.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000
 And why is it good to have that pulse rate there? What's it telling you?

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:16.000
 You're making carbon dioxide at a high rate and running energy through the system.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:25.000
 As you increase mitochondrial oxidation, you decrease free radical oxidation.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:45.000
 A low thyroid person who isn't producing much heat or CO2 will even at rest be churning out the lipid peroxidizing type of oxides.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:17:08.000
 And as you run the mitochondrion faster, burning sugar, producing CO2 and making heat, you will turn off the pro-inflammatory lipid peroxidizing random electrons.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:15.000
 They're being sucked up by the properly used oxygen.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000
 Women generally have a faster pulse rate than men, right?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
 Yeah, the heart is smaller.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:29.000
 Oh, really? So they generally have, is it 5 to 10 beats more than men?

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
 Something like that.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:40.000
 Here's an email from Labby, great name. "Hi Dr. Peat, I'd like to utilize aspirin due to your information about it since I take it quite often.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000
 What are benefits to getting in a bulk as opposed to tablets from the store?

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000
 Do they contain excipients that the bulk aspirin does not?"

01:17:51.000 --> 01:18:01.000
 Oh, sure, there's usually paraffin, sometimes talc in the tablet.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:19.000
 Until I was able to get the bulk, I would always pour boiling water over an aspirin tablet and let it disintegrate so that the paraffin would float to the surface and the talc would sink to the bottom.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
 Wow, so just a little bear, they have these little excipients in there?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
 Bear aspirin in the tablets?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:35.000
 The cleanest aspirins were usually the ones you get with the supermarket's brand name.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
 No kidding.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:19:01.000
 The fewest harmful excipients, but you can get a clean USP, just the same quality of aspirin that you would get in the tablets, but you can in bulk, sold for horses for example.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
 Then you can trust that it doesn't have the excipients.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.000
 And then aspirin, do you take it fairly regularly and what does it do for you?

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
 I try to remember to take some every night.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
 Really? How many milligrams?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
 About 300.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
 It would be like one bear, right?

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
 Yeah.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
 And what does that do, help you sleep?

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
 I just do it on general principles.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:36.000
 Just general principles. So aspirin is pretty interesting, is it really from the willow bark thing? Is that where it came from?

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:47.000
 It's the same stuff that they used to get from natural sources like bark, but the stuff you buy is even cleaner.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:20:00.000
 It's a very simple chemical that doesn't have manufacturing impurities like a lot of chemicals do.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:13.000
 An emailer says, "Wasn't Samuel Hahnemann one of the first doctors to challenge the detoxification theory?"

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:19.000
 Oh, with the homeopathy?

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
 Yeah, the homeopathy guy.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:30.000
 Yeah, the basic orientation was that you trusted your immune system to do the right thing.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:45.000
 When I was about 10 years old, I read some of the old homeopathy books my grandparents had and saw that homeopathy in that sense was very sensible.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:58.000
 It just meant not intervening with toxic chemicals like mercury and arsenic, which had been very, very common.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:06.000
 Women were commonly given arsenic because of supposed anemia.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:14.000
 And in general, is aspirin anti-inflammatory?

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
 Aspirin, yes, very important.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
 Anti-inflammatory.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:29.000
 Here's one. "Is Tupelo honey good for diabetics? It's one of the only honeys based on fructose."

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:40.000
 Oh, no. I think all honey is roughly half fructose and half glucose.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:52.000
 The thing with honey you have to watch out for is whether the bees were eating industrial chemicals or allergens.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:22:00.000
 The allergen that the bee eats can be passed into the honey.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.000
 And with bees, you don't really know exactly what's going on and what they're eating, do you?

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:12.000
 I mean, they claim some honey is organic, but how do they know where they go?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:27.000
 You have to have lots of land devoted to organic farming before you can tell that the bees have a range of how far they can fly.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:39.000
 They can go quite a distance, but after a speed, they have a definite radius for every hive.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:54.000
 I think that New Zealand has some good standards that they claim that some of the best where you got to have like five or ten miles or something of no chemicals and stuff.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:03.000
 Here is Mark. He's taking 30,000 milligrams of D every day, vitamin D and K combo in an MCT oil.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
 The results have been really amazing.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:12.000
 I'm almost 63 and work full days on the hot South Carolina heat.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:19.000
 I've also been able to reduce my needed sleep time from two to six hours a night.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:28.000
 So do you think that this D3 is hormone boosting and really I should continue if I'm having a good result?

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:35.000
 You should have an occasional blood test if you're taking large amounts like that.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:49.000
 I don't know of a toxic level being reached with 30,000 per day, but it's conceivable.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
 So maybe twice a year would be good to check your level.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:02.000
 And then if you get out in the sun a lot, I guess it would be reasonable to think that you could get too much, right?

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:13.000
 No, no, no one is known to have raised their vitamin D from the sun to a dangerous point.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:27.000
 People working shirtless in the sun hours a day will typically have well over 100, 150 is common for on the blood test.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
 But it's not a problem though. It's not a problem.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
 Not at all.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:40.000
 Could you please ask Dr. Peat what diet does he suggest for losing weight that isn't only milk and orange juice?

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000
 Milk and orange juice is good. I like it.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:25:04.000
 You can throw in an occasional egg and scallop and be sure to have fiber, raw carrot or cooked mushrooms or bamboo shoots or oat bran cereals, for example.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.000
 And how about gaining weight? What if you want to gain some pounds? What are foods to eat there? That's my job.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:24.000
 Usually with men in particular, the inability to put on a normal amount of mass, especially muscle, is from having a thyroid problem.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:44.000
 And the thyroid makes you able to retain magnesium, which lets your cell shift over from mere energy production to anabolic muscle building.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
 Muscle building, yeah.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:59.000
 So the combination of an adequate magnesium in your diet and sometimes a thyroid supplement will suddenly let a man put on muscle.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
 Put on muscle, huh? So it's back to that old pesky thyroid again.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000
 Here's an email from Hussein in Dallas, Texas.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:20.000
 What should I do about bloating? I drink orange juice with collagen every day, stay away from poofers as much as I can, incorporate dairy and drink milk and I use Progest-D before I go to sleep.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:27.000
 Also, how many bowel movements do you recommend per day? But he's still having some issues with bloating. What can he look at?

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:49.000
 Some people have a problem with manufactured gelatin. They might call it collagen, but collagen has to be extracted at a mild temperature and it usually costs something like $10 a gram.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:27:02.000
 Very expensive. They're really getting gelatin and the gelatin causes many people to get gas.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
 The gelatin does?

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:29.000
 Yeah, partly because they might be taking too much or not dissolving it totally enough so that it is incompletely digested by your digestive enzymes, letting bacteria live on what you don't digest.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:48.000
 Here's an email, Doc, from Finland. Wow, Eric, he's in Finland. I'm curious about chlorine dioxide and its possible use in combating night COVID. How does it compare to the ivermectin and hydroxychlorine thing protocols?

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
 What was the oxide?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
 Chlorine dioxide.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
 Oh.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000
 Yeah, also known as miracle mineral supplement. You know that one?

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:18.000
 Yeah. Even when it's been studied as an additive to treat city water, it has a slight carcinogenic effect. Chlorine compounds are always risky.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:24.000
 Yeah, so you're just not a fan of using that at all?

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:36.000
 No, the prolonged general use, even at a very low level, do increase the rate of mutations in cancer.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:50.000
 In general, what are some things that people that are safe and a lot of folks take that in your experience, Dr. Ray Peat, you found to be not the best choice? Can something come to mind for you?

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
 Oh, yeah, ascorbic acid.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
 Ascorbic acid. It is not a vitamin C guy at all, right?

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:17.000
 Yeah, and the manufactured things, ascorbic acid and citric acid, and I think all of those supposedly simple sugar-based food additives, the way they're manufactured makes them very different from the natural substance.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:42.000
 I years ago found that I could detect the small amount of ascorbic acid that was added to breakfast cereal, bread, canned vegetables, bologna, places you would never expect it would cause migraine-like symptoms.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:54.000
 And still I could drink a gallon of orange juice or other natural source of vitamin C every day with no reaction.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:10.000
 Speaking of that, do I remember that you recommend, if folks get organic grass-fed milk if you can at the store, to do low-fat rather than full-fat? Is that true? Why is that?

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:23.000
 If you're going to drink two quarts and more per day, you're going to get fat most likely on full-fat unless you're working on the farm.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.000
 But for me, though, if I wanted to gain a little weight, it's okay, I just do the full-fat stuff, right?

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000
 Sure, it's a good source of vitamins.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:43.000
 This is from Patrick in Lake City, Florida. "Do you know what I could be done for life? Home isn't a dog." Thank you. Oh, that comes up every now and then.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:31:03.000
 I think, as in people, it's basically a metabolic thyroid problem. And again, the calcium and vitamin D support for your thyroid metabolism are probably going to be helpful.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:10.000
 So get more calcium in the dog's diet, which would be bones, right? Maybe bones?

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:26.000
 Well, the bones come with too much phosphate, and very often lead, cadmium and other things go into the bones. So cottage cheese is something dogs almost always like.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:35.000
 Oh, cottage cheese? That'll get more calcium in there. And what was the other substance that we like for lipomas?

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
 Some vitamin D.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.000
 Vitamin D. So you could give a little bit of the vitamin D supplement that we take ourselves to them.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
 Yeah.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:51.000
 Does Dr. Peat think that homeopathic cell salts are a good way to get minerals?

01:31:51.000 --> 01:32:02.000
 A very expensive way. You get those same minerals just eating a regular diet.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:20.000
 As an addition to my previous question, Dr. Peat, polysocanols and their benefits. Polycosanol.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:43.000
 Yeah, polycosanol. Yeah.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:33:11.000
 And a lot of other sources. Wax. Very few people chew sugar cane. So another source is the leaf, the wax on green leafy vegetables. And on the cereal bran, it's a coating, waterproofing on plant material.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:19.000
 A couple more, then we'll let you go here and see if I can clean up a few of them from last time, if I can get to them.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:31.000
 Dr. Peat, why does or doesn't fructose from juice or fruit cause a fatty liver since it can only be exclusively being metabolized by the liver?

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:36.000
 Jason, Feng, and others seem to be concerned about damaged liver from fructose.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:44.000
 That's just another myth. Our brain can metabolize fructose.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:57.000
 Boy, I tell you what, if I wake up in the middle of the night, which is often, nothing like a fresh squeeze orange juice and boy, that puts me back to Gaga Land pretty quick. What's going on there?

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:11.000
 The potassium is one of the things that help us use the glucose oxidatively and so it stabilizes our blood sugar.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:16.000
 Or it's hard to find. Do you squeeze your own organic oranges? What do you do?

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:36.000
 When we can get sweet organic oranges, otherwise we'll use unorganic and just be very careful about the peelings to not get any of the peeling material crushed into the juice.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:43.000
 Oh, so you think most of the cooties are in the peelings and not in the orange itself?

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
 Most of it, yeah.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:56.000
 Wow, that's good news because you can get unconventional or conventional fresh juice a lot of places. It's hard to find organic fresh juice. Interesting.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:06.000
 Yeah, and often the organic oranges, because of the higher demand, they'll often be unsweet.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:17.000
 Unsweet, yeah. So we like the sweet ones. Well, Dr. Peat, thank you so much for being here. We appreciate it. Thanks for coming on the show once a month.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:23.000
 Okay, how is your show doing against the censorship?

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:35.000
 Well, they put us in censor heaven on YouTube, but other than that we're doing okay. So we have BitChute and places, but thanks for asking.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:41.000
 Yeah, YouTube, they just knocked us off the planet there.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:53.000
 Yeah, what do you think your role is against the oppressors? Are you making headway?

01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:03.000
 I don't know, you know. I don't know. We just keep putting it out there and talking to folks like you and a lot of the things about the vaccine.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:12.000
 But, you know, Doc, even on Facebook you even mention vaccine and you get flagged. It's really challenging right now what they're doing.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:19.000
 I don't know if you saw, but Rand Paul put a whole video just about "don't comply," you know, that kind of thing. Don't comply.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:26.000
 And they brought down his YouTube video. They just, from YouTube, took it down.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:33.000
 So, you know, we do what we can, sir.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:38.000
 I think it probably is making headway.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:50.000
 Yeah, well, we're doing what we can. Thanks for asking. You take care of yourself and we'll see you in mid-September. Wow, it'll be fall. Thank you so much.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
 Okay, thank you. Bye.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:03.000
 Dr. Ray Peat. RayPeat.com. His newsletter is RayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:11.000
 RayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com. What a sweet man, huh?

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:22.000
 Well, I've been drinking my grass-fed organic milk at the HEB here in Dripping Springs.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:29.000
 So I've been drinking that. That's kind of fun. And lots of orange juice. I don't know if you've ever really did the orange juice thing.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:35.000
 There's something pretty magical about that. But we can get organic oranges now. You know, you squoze them up.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:44.000
 So that's kind of fun. And if you haven't tried orange juice, I mean, I went most of my life thinking that orange juice had too much sugar.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.000
 But I sure don't feel that like that now. So it's kind of fun.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.000
 Okay, kids, well, we're going to have a little time off here and I will see you tomorrow.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:07.000
 We have Jet Blake. He's a philosopher, raconteur, quantum physics guy. Fascinating stuff. Jet Blake will be here tomorrow.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:15.000
 And then David Sirita. David Sirita is a really unique soul. We all are.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:22.000
 But he's a unique soul that is into all kinds of wild things and all kinds of stuff that I think you're going to like.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:30.000
 As far as vibrations and sounds and light. And then on Wednesday, Charlie Sewell is going to be here.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:41.000
 And Charlie has done quite a bit of research in the field of the lawfulness of people telling you what to do.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:47.000
 Injections, basking and all this stuff. And he's going to have some real solutions for you.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:52.000
 All we think that you can file and/or give to people.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
 And so we're going to cover that on Wednesday.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000
 So thank you for your ongoing support. We have some great people.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:06.000
 If you have it in your budget to buy some things that are to help you, go on our website.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.000
 Look at all of the people that we know and promote and have for years.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.000
 And we think that you're going to find some good things there.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000
 Because we know all of these people and we use it.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:26.000
 So it's good to know the people that you're spending your money with.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000
 Okay. I love you all very much. Thank you.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000
 We'll see you in the morning with Jet Blake at 10 o'clock Central Time.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
 Let me know if I can help with anything.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
 Thank you. May the blessings be.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000
 You're doing good. Crazy, but you're doing good.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:56.000
