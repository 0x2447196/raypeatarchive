0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:10.220
 Well, welcome to the Get Fit with Jodell podcast and grab your pen and paper and get ready

0:00:10.220 --> 0:00:15.640
 to take notes and learn from one of the greats because Dr. Raymond Peet is back again answering

0:00:15.640 --> 0:00:19.480
 your questions and mine today because I have questions today.

0:00:19.480 --> 0:00:26.000
 So if you're not familiar with Dr. Peat, he's been on the show several times and we all love him.

0:00:26.000 --> 0:00:27.380
 We love to learn from him.

0:00:27.380 --> 0:00:31.460
 You can find out more by visiting raypeat.com,

0:00:31.460 --> 0:00:33.760
 that's R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.

0:00:33.760 --> 0:00:36.840
 And I highly recommend checking out his articles,

0:00:36.840 --> 0:00:39.400
 his blog, and also his newsletter.

0:00:39.400 --> 0:00:43.640
 So you can get that by emailing

0:00:43.640 --> 0:00:45.000
 raypeatsnewsletter at gmail.com.

0:00:46.960 --> 0:00:48.760
 And so I'll have that in the show notes

0:00:48.760 --> 0:00:51.200
 for you guys to check out if you haven't already done so.

0:00:51.200 --> 0:00:54.940
 We're gonna be talking about his newsletter

0:00:54.940 --> 0:00:56.660
 that just came out last night.

0:00:56.660 --> 0:00:58.340
 As soon as I got it in my email,

0:00:58.340 --> 0:01:01.040
 I was like immediately reading through it,

0:01:01.040 --> 0:01:04.300
 best newsletter so far that I've read of Dr. Peet.

0:01:04.300 --> 0:01:05.040
 So we're gonna touch on that I've read of Dr. Pete. So we're going to touch

0:01:05.040 --> 0:01:11.280
 on that today because it blew my hair back. So I'm so excited, Dr. Pete, to have you on. Thank

0:01:11.280 --> 0:01:15.840
 you for coming back on the show. Okay, very good. Thank you.

0:01:17.360 --> 0:01:23.680
 So yeah, I've got quite a few listener questions as well. And I've got my own questions today based

0:01:23.680 --> 0:01:27.640
 on the newsletter and just some things going on. So I'm excited to get

0:01:27.640 --> 0:01:30.920
 started. As you guys know, I've been banned from YouTube. So

0:01:30.920 --> 0:01:34.920
 this is only available on audio. So be sure to share this with

0:01:34.920 --> 0:01:37.300
 someone you know, that's going to benefit from it. They're not

0:01:37.300 --> 0:01:39.280
 going to find it on YouTube right now. They're only going to

0:01:39.280 --> 0:01:43.160
 find it on podcast players. So be sure to share and if you guys

0:01:43.160 --> 0:01:45.480
 have more questions for Dr. Pete,

0:01:45.480 --> 0:01:49.240
 I can't post like I was on YouTube and ask for questions.

0:01:49.240 --> 0:01:50.900
 So if you hear this podcast

0:01:50.900 --> 0:01:52.920
 and your question wasn't answered,

0:01:52.920 --> 0:01:55.840
 just email me at getfitwithjodell at gmail.com

0:01:55.840 --> 0:01:57.300
 and I'll be sure to get it in the queue

0:01:57.300 --> 0:01:59.120
 for the next podcast.

0:01:59.120 --> 0:02:02.680
 So let's start right off because Dr. Pete,

0:02:02.680 --> 0:02:05.840
 your newsletter was, like I said, one of my favorites.

0:02:05.840 --> 0:02:12.480
 I lost my mom to cancer at 17. And what I do today is because of what I didn't understand

0:02:12.480 --> 0:02:18.720
 about her health and how to help her because I was so young. And she did all the mainstream

0:02:18.720 --> 0:02:26.000
 cancer killing therapies. And after watching her go through chemo, surgery, radiation, more chemo, then

0:02:26.000 --> 0:02:31.560
 finally out of desperation, alternative treatments out of Mexico that didn't work when her, because

0:02:31.560 --> 0:02:38.000
 her body was too wrecked from the cancer killing therapies, I'm convinced that it was the therapies

0:02:38.000 --> 0:02:49.940
 that killed her, not the cancer. And so when I read your latest newsletter, the carcinogen metabolism, it was just phenomenal.

0:02:49.940 --> 0:02:52.940
 One thing that you said in the newsletter really jumped out at me.

0:02:52.940 --> 0:02:59.780
 There are many substances that can inhibit the inflammatory degenerative processes acting

0:02:59.780 --> 0:03:01.620
 at multiple levels.

0:03:01.620 --> 0:03:06.080
 These substances tend to be synergistic so that a great number of

0:03:06.080 --> 0:03:11.620
 substances can be safely used at the same time. This kind of supportive therapy has

0:03:11.620 --> 0:03:18.620
 nothing in common with the ruling paradigm of cancer treatment. It is reinforcing the

0:03:18.620 --> 0:03:26.440
 organism's state of health rather than attacking the disease of cancer. That's what I want to help people do,

0:03:26.440 --> 0:03:28.400
 is reinforce their state of health

0:03:28.400 --> 0:03:30.940
 rather than attacking the disease of cancer.

0:03:30.940 --> 0:03:33.360
 That's what I want people listening to this today

0:03:33.360 --> 0:03:38.120
 to take home is that there's a lot of therapies out there

0:03:38.120 --> 0:03:39.620
 that are traditional mainstream,

0:03:39.620 --> 0:03:42.400
 but there's also a lot of adjunct therapies

0:03:42.400 --> 0:03:47.280
 that are synergistic and at least could support our organism and our

0:03:47.280 --> 0:03:52.480
 host immune system while they're undergoing these treatments. It's not to say that people can't

0:03:52.480 --> 0:03:58.960
 undergo radiation and chemo and things like that, but I think I agreed with you that they're

0:03:58.960 --> 0:04:06.080
 attacking the disease of cancer rather than reinforcing the organism's state of health, which should be what's most

0:04:06.080 --> 0:04:11.920
 important. So I just really like this. Yeah, go ahead.

0:04:13.680 --> 0:04:29.120
 Their basic mistake, mainstream medicine now for about 100 years has been committed to the idea that cancer, a mutation, is something alien to

0:04:29.120 --> 0:04:31.280
 the human being.

0:04:31.280 --> 0:04:40.840
 But the mutations are the attempt to survive and remain part of the human organism.

0:04:40.840 --> 0:04:50.380
 They are our cells that are struggling and if you focus on killing these cells

0:04:50.380 --> 0:05:00.220
 that are already very weak and damaged you forget that what kills them kills or

0:05:00.220 --> 0:05:08.560
 injures the rest of the human cells. They are so similar, it's kind of like

0:05:08.560 --> 0:05:17.000
 trying to, it's more possible to kill an invasive fungus, but still things that

0:05:17.000 --> 0:05:25.000
 kill fungus or amoebas for example, are always harmful to the human host.

0:05:28.820 --> 0:05:32.860
 If you look at the very few people

0:05:32.860 --> 0:05:37.100
 who have studied untreated cancer patients,

0:05:37.100 --> 0:05:40.420
 starting as far as I know in the 1950s

0:05:40.420 --> 0:05:44.440
 with the University of California professor, Hardin Jones,

0:05:45.000 --> 0:05:47.560
 with the University of California Professor Hardin Jones. He looked at people who, for some reason,

0:05:47.560 --> 0:05:52.080
 refused treatment after being diagnosed.

0:05:52.080 --> 0:05:57.080
 And these people almost always lived longer

0:05:57.120 --> 0:05:58.900
 than the thoroughly treated people,

0:05:59.760 --> 0:06:02.360
 the people who respected treatment.

0:06:02.360 --> 0:06:07.260
 And since those aren't taken into account,

0:06:08.140 --> 0:06:12.500
 everyone who is diagnosed with cancer

0:06:12.500 --> 0:06:15.680
 essentially gets the killing treatment.

0:06:17.280 --> 0:06:20.640
 And if you really did a control,

0:06:21.880 --> 0:06:34.000
 you would compare the absence of treatment to a particular treatment, but I've read through many volumes of the Cancer Research Journal,

0:06:34.000 --> 0:06:45.600
 and invariably they fail to take into account the possibility that the treatment ever kills anyone.

0:06:47.200 --> 0:06:57.440
 If hundreds and hundreds of articles absolutely insist that everyone who dies, dies from cancer,

0:06:59.200 --> 0:07:06.000
 they don't even consider the possibility that the treatment increase the death.

0:07:06.000 --> 0:07:11.520
 Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, like you mentioned, it's about reinforcing health.

0:07:11.520 --> 0:07:15.740
 How can you reinforce the state of health in the organism if you're attacking

0:07:15.740 --> 0:07:19.400
 both the good and the bad cells with some therapy?

0:07:19.400 --> 0:07:20.440
 It just doesn't make sense.

0:07:20.440 --> 0:07:25.120
 There's a big debate out there about taking supplements when undergoing cancer

0:07:25.120 --> 0:07:31.760
 treatment. But my job as a nutritionist to support is to support that host immune system and reinforce

0:07:31.760 --> 0:07:37.520
 the state of health. And so there's this debate that you can't take antioxidants during a radiation

0:07:37.520 --> 0:07:44.720
 therapy or during a chemo treatment. And I can see both sides. I can see how, yeah, the supplement,

0:07:42.960 --> 0:07:45.480
 And I can see both sides. I can see how, yeah, the supplement,

0:07:45.480 --> 0:07:47.160
 depending on which one it is,

0:07:47.160 --> 0:07:51.000
 could interfere with the oxidant support of the cell

0:07:51.000 --> 0:07:52.840
 or the antioxidant capability

0:07:52.840 --> 0:07:54.240
 that you're trying to kill off

0:07:54.240 --> 0:07:56.080
 with the radiation or whatever.

0:07:56.080 --> 0:07:58.040
 But at the same time, what about all the good?

0:07:58.040 --> 0:08:00.600
 Like you've got this one little area that's cancerous,

0:08:00.600 --> 0:08:03.200
 but you've got the 90% of you that's really good.

0:08:03.200 --> 0:08:04.640
 Shouldn't we support that?

0:08:04.640 --> 0:08:07.880
 And shouldn't we come at it from a standpoint

0:08:07.880 --> 0:08:09.760
 of helping rather than harming?

0:08:11.920 --> 0:08:16.920
 Yeah, and the treatment industry has covered up the fact

0:08:18.440 --> 0:08:22.220
 that there is no such thing as a local,

0:08:22.220 --> 0:08:24.560
 a purely local cancer treatment.

0:08:24.560 --> 0:08:29.560
 For example, the focusing radiation beam,

0:08:31.440 --> 0:08:35.600
 they say if we aim it at the cancer,

0:08:35.600 --> 0:08:39.440
 the rest of your body isn't affected.

0:08:39.440 --> 0:08:43.340
 But experiments show that, for example,

0:08:44.440 --> 0:08:50.600
 they noticed that exposing mice to x-rays caused them to

0:08:50.600 --> 0:08:56.760
 go into heat preparing to mate.

0:08:56.760 --> 0:09:02.160
 The explanation was that they had excited their pituitary.

0:09:02.160 --> 0:09:07.040
 So someone did the proper control and radiated their feet

0:09:08.280 --> 0:09:11.080
 and found that that caused them to go into heat.

0:09:12.800 --> 0:09:17.200
 And the same with any very serious damage

0:09:17.200 --> 0:09:19.120
 to any part of the body.

0:09:19.120 --> 0:09:24.120
 It spreads signals of the damage to all parts of the body.

0:09:28.040 --> 0:09:36.080
 So that in Seattle Seattle there was this idea of pregnant women who had a full set of dental x-rays even though

0:09:36.080 --> 0:09:42.600
 they shielded their abdomen, their babies were born underweight and

0:09:42.600 --> 0:09:48.760
 showing that the stress damage signals affected every part of the

0:09:48.760 --> 0:09:56.640
 body just from supposedly exposing the head and jaw to x-rays.

0:09:56.640 --> 0:10:02.520
 Yeah, no, that makes, that's, you know, you don't hear about this stuff. All you hear

0:10:02.520 --> 0:10:05.760
 about is like the different doctors saying,

0:10:05.760 --> 0:10:07.680
 no, you can't, this is the only path.

0:10:07.680 --> 0:10:08.680
 We only have this.

0:10:08.680 --> 0:10:11.160
 This is our approach is like kill, kill, kill.

0:10:11.160 --> 0:10:12.760
 And there's so many other avenues.

0:10:12.760 --> 0:10:15.200
 Like I loved in your newsletter

0:10:15.200 --> 0:10:18.880
 where you were mentioning things like mTOR

0:10:18.880 --> 0:10:21.760
 and things that could inhibit mTOR include caffeine

0:10:21.760 --> 0:10:26.040
 and aspirin and lidocaine and vitamin D and flavonoids.

0:10:26.040 --> 0:10:30.200
 Like, can you briefly like fill us in layman's terms,

0:10:30.200 --> 0:10:34.460
 like how does mTOR work within some sort of like

0:10:34.460 --> 0:10:36.560
 inhibitory action with cancer

0:10:36.560 --> 0:10:38.540
 and why these things are important?

0:10:41.280 --> 0:10:48.640
 Yeah, mTOR is a phosphorylating, activating enzyme.

0:10:48.640 --> 0:10:55.000
 And this particular enzyme activates all of the growth processes.

0:10:55.000 --> 0:11:05.000
 So for normal growth, it's, all of the growth promoting factors

0:11:08.960 --> 0:11:10.900
 have to know when to stop.

0:11:12.080 --> 0:11:15.000
 And if you have stress going on,

0:11:15.940 --> 0:11:18.280
 circulating lactic acid, for example,

0:11:18.280 --> 0:11:22.680
 for any kind of systemic stress,

0:11:22.680 --> 0:11:26.960
 lactic acid is enough to keep the mTOR

0:11:26.960 --> 0:11:29.720
 activating growth processes

0:11:29.720 --> 0:11:33.020
 without the appropriate need for it.

0:11:33.020 --> 0:11:37.680
 And so lactic acid is carcinogenic

0:11:37.680 --> 0:11:42.680
 by not allowing the body to turn off growth when it should.

0:11:44.120 --> 0:11:48.840
 And it turns out that stressed tissues produce lactic acid.

0:11:48.840 --> 0:11:51.180
 So you get a vicious circle.

0:11:52.200 --> 0:11:53.040
 Yeah.

0:11:53.040 --> 0:11:54.640
 And there are like you,

0:11:54.640 --> 0:11:57.440
 I appreciated that in your newsletter, you did mention,

0:11:57.440 --> 0:11:59.120
 I mean, there are some of the flavonoids

0:11:59.120 --> 0:12:01.560
 known as antioxidants, like absorbic acid

0:12:01.560 --> 0:12:05.920
 and things like that, that they can become an issue,

0:12:05.920 --> 0:12:08.780
 like reducing agents for stuff like radiation

0:12:08.780 --> 0:12:09.940
 and stuff like that.

0:12:09.940 --> 0:12:14.400
 So are there certain supplements that people can do

0:12:14.400 --> 0:12:15.620
 if they've been diagnosed

0:12:15.620 --> 0:12:17.220
 and they're undergoing these treatments,

0:12:17.220 --> 0:12:18.460
 they choose to go that route?

0:12:18.460 --> 0:12:20.860
 And are there different ones they shouldn't do?

0:12:32.040 --> 0:12:52.800
 shouldn't do? Yeah, in the right amount the antioxidants will actually be beneficial but when they get inside the cell a typical antioxidant like ascorbic acid or some of the flavonoids like phycetin are no longer reducing agents, they no longer

0:12:52.800 --> 0:13:00.280
 are known by donating electrons, but they become oxidizing agents and keep the cell

0:13:00.280 --> 0:13:09.360
 from having an excess of electrons. And one of the most basic features of cancer is

0:13:09.360 --> 0:13:32.000
 that they have an excess of electrons. If you simply shut off the oxygen supply,

0:13:32.000 --> 0:13:45.000
 you'll shift over to lactic acid production because electrons become excessive and will turn pyruvic acid into lactic acid,

0:13:47.140 --> 0:13:51.240
 with all of the cell activating effects.

0:13:54.480 --> 0:13:58.780
 Some very, very well-informed,

0:14:00.220 --> 0:14:05.000
 leading biological thinkers are still confused on the issue.

0:14:06.580 --> 0:14:11.380
 They still think that more electrons

0:14:11.380 --> 0:14:13.660
 will be good for cancer patients,

0:14:13.660 --> 0:14:17.040
 but in fact, the failure to oxidize,

0:14:17.040 --> 0:14:21.140
 meaning that your cells have too many electrons,

0:14:21.140 --> 0:14:23.460
 that's the essence of cancer,

0:14:23.460 --> 0:14:31.680
 and why the increase of lactic acid is a universal feature of cancer.

0:14:33.040 --> 0:14:40.160
 Okay, yeah, and so are there, so it's best to get flavonoids from food. I love that you said that in

0:14:40.160 --> 0:14:46.080
 your newsletter. Are there certain ones, let's say someone listening to this has been

0:14:46.080 --> 0:14:52.960
 diagnosed with cancer and they're undergoing, maybe they've chosen to go these therapies such

0:14:52.960 --> 0:14:59.120
 as radiation or chemo, where would you steer them? What protocol or suggestions would you give them

0:14:59.120 --> 0:15:03.520
 to help them reinforce their state of health rather than just do the attack?

0:15:04.800 --> 0:15:06.200
 reinforce their state of health rather than just do the attack?

0:15:14.960 --> 0:15:22.880
 The reason doctors advise against using some supplements like vitamin E is that they are wanting to create free radical oxidation,

0:15:22.880 --> 0:15:30.000
 which always results from an excess of electrons, activating catalytic

0:15:30.000 --> 0:15:35.000
 iron, for example, to create free radicals.

0:15:35.000 --> 0:15:51.080
 I knew someone who was taking protective substances, and the doctor prescribed the standard course of chemotherapy and said

0:15:51.080 --> 0:15:59.440
 it would be no more than, I think it was three doses of it, absolutely three doses was all

0:15:59.440 --> 0:16:01.600
 that would be needed.

0:16:01.600 --> 0:16:11.080
 But after three doses, he said, well, we need another three doses. And after that three doses, he said, well, you need

0:16:11.080 --> 0:16:27.500
 another three doses. And she said, I finally got him to admit that he had previously said only three would be needed. And he explained that your hair hasn't fallen out

0:16:27.520 --> 0:16:29.040
 and you're not anemic.

0:16:30.480 --> 0:16:33.800
 And those were the judge, the basis for judging.

0:16:33.800 --> 0:16:38.800
 You have to radically harm the whole organism

0:16:39.680 --> 0:16:43.780
 before you're satisfied that the chemotherapy is working.

0:16:44.960 --> 0:16:49.960
 She ended up looking for thermal therapy,

0:16:51.000 --> 0:16:53.240
 hyperthermia to treat the cancer,

0:16:53.240 --> 0:16:56.320
 which there's a lot of research

0:16:56.320 --> 0:16:59.160
 showing that getting the body temperature

0:16:59.160 --> 0:17:04.160
 up to just a little above 41 degrees Celsius

0:17:04.760 --> 0:17:09.280
 will kill cancer cells without harming healthy cells.

0:17:10.280 --> 0:17:12.500
 If you keep feeding the person

0:17:12.500 --> 0:17:15.860
 so they don't get hypoglycemia damage.

0:17:16.940 --> 0:17:21.780
 But she went to a place that advertised hyperthermia,

0:17:22.780 --> 0:17:28.960
 but the government required that they give a minimal dose, they said,

0:17:28.960 --> 0:17:32.240
 of x-rays along with the hyperthermia.

0:17:33.040 --> 0:17:37.220
 And after a couple of doses of the treatment,

0:17:38.440 --> 0:17:43.000
 I got her to inquire how they were judging

0:17:43.000 --> 0:17:47.080
 that she had reached a hyperthermic state and they

0:17:47.080 --> 0:17:53.440
 told her, oh the computer does that. No thermometers involved, just absolute

0:17:53.440 --> 0:18:02.400
 mystical computer knowledge. And then she asked how many rads was she getting and

0:18:02.400 --> 0:18:07.920
 I think it was 800 radads to her whole pelvis which included

0:18:07.920 --> 0:18:13.820
 the intestine and she was getting classical radiation sickness which sets

0:18:13.820 --> 0:18:30.000
 in around a whole body dose of about 400 or 500 rads so she had had about three times the dose that causes radiation sickness.

0:18:30.000 --> 0:18:46.080
 And very quickly after that died from radiation sickness, not from cancer. Yeah, it's like logic has gone by the wayside when it comes to our medical system. It's just like

0:18:47.120 --> 0:18:53.440
 it's a sad approach because there I think there are protocols and suggestions that people can do

0:18:53.440 --> 0:18:59.200
 to reinforce. So like in your newsletter progesterone and you mentioned vitamin D,

0:18:59.200 --> 0:19:10.440
 can you talk about that? Yeah, both of those systemically lower inflammation. So they're just as

0:19:10.440 --> 0:19:32.400
 good for treating COVID as for cancer or psychiatric diseases or a cold because what they do is turn the body towards healthy energy production through oxygen

0:19:33.200 --> 0:19:42.240
 and by reducing the inflammation they are letting the body restore itself.

0:19:43.920 --> 0:19:44.420
 Wonderful.

0:19:42.600 --> 0:19:44.020
 restore itself.

0:19:44.860 --> 0:19:46.780
 Wonderful. Now, go ahead.

0:19:46.780 --> 0:19:51.780
 Antihistamines are another pretty safe way to do that.

0:19:52.940 --> 0:19:57.160
 And in a previous newsletter,

0:19:57.160 --> 0:19:59.500
 I reviewed some of the articles

0:20:00.580 --> 0:20:03.300
 showing the benefits of exercise.

0:20:03.300 --> 0:20:04.140
 Yeah.

0:20:04.140 --> 0:20:07.920
 And they found that the good things about

0:20:07.920 --> 0:20:15.160
 exercise that help you maintain good muscles, good hormone balance, all kinds

0:20:15.160 --> 0:20:23.200
 of good health points. They found that only when the exercise was sufficient to

0:20:23.200 --> 0:20:27.040
 raise your body temperature did it produce that

0:20:27.040 --> 0:20:31.620
 anti-inflammatory restorative effect.

0:20:31.620 --> 0:20:41.060
 And if they raised the body temperature to that point, the same temperature that adequate

0:20:41.060 --> 0:20:46.900
 exercise produces, they got just as much anti-inflammatory effect.

0:20:47.740 --> 0:20:51.900
 So it's the body temperature falling below normal

0:20:51.900 --> 0:20:56.900
 that is a basic activator of inflammation.

0:20:57.260 --> 0:21:01.460
 And all of the major carcinogens,

0:21:01.460 --> 0:21:05.000
 by reducing oxygen metabolism,

0:21:05.640 --> 0:21:07.580
 lower the body temperature.

0:21:07.580 --> 0:21:12.580
 And so necessarily result in systemic inflammation.

0:21:14.840 --> 0:21:17.280
 So important to keep that thyroid working

0:21:17.280 --> 0:21:20.080
 and keep that body temperature where it should be

0:21:20.080 --> 0:21:22.680
 in cancer prevention then that sounds like.

0:21:22.680 --> 0:21:24.640
 So going back to the vitamin D,

0:21:24.640 --> 0:21:27.440
 I kind of had something I wanted to really bring up

0:21:27.440 --> 0:21:30.000
 because there's controversy out there.

0:21:30.000 --> 0:21:32.640
 A lot of people are not on the bandwagon

0:21:32.640 --> 0:21:34.360
 of vitamin D supplementation.

0:21:34.360 --> 0:21:37.720
 They feel like you should just get it from the sun.

0:21:37.720 --> 0:21:39.880
 But what about these, as a nutritionist,

0:21:39.880 --> 0:21:43.240
 I'm seeing people that as much as I would love them

0:21:43.240 --> 0:21:47.480
 to go outside, they're going out covered up, they're wearing sunscreen, or

0:21:47.480 --> 0:21:49.520
 maybe they're only going out long enough to walk around the

0:21:49.520 --> 0:21:54.080
 block. So there's not to mention the fact that there's published

0:21:54.080 --> 0:21:56.560
 data that now there's nanoparticles being sprayed in

0:21:56.560 --> 0:21:59.520
 our atmosphere, they're blocking the sun's rays. So that leads me

0:21:59.520 --> 0:22:03.920
 to believe that we do need some form of vitamin D supplementation

0:22:03.920 --> 0:22:06.460
 in certain people that just will not go outside.

0:22:06.460 --> 0:22:08.400
 What are your thoughts on that?

0:22:08.400 --> 0:22:12.600
 I mean, are you for vitamin D with K2 supplementation

0:22:12.600 --> 0:22:15.780
 or do you feel like it should just be from the sun?

0:22:17.520 --> 0:22:21.200
 Ideally, it would be from the sun,

0:22:21.200 --> 0:22:24.880
 but I've talked to people in Saudi Arabia

0:22:24.880 --> 0:22:29.400
 and Latin America. There's a

0:22:29.400 --> 0:22:38.600
 tremendous like an epidemic or worse of vitamin D deficiency in the

0:22:38.600 --> 0:22:47.580
 traditionally Muslim and Catholic countries. Women in particular. Well, the Saudi Arabians, even

0:22:47.580 --> 0:23:00.560
 the men, were pretty much total body covers, but the women don't let any skin

0:23:00.560 --> 0:23:07.260
 be exposed to the sunlight, and so they have a terrible vitamin D deficiency.

0:23:08.100 --> 0:23:10.640
 The same in Mexico, people are,

0:23:10.640 --> 0:23:15.560
 even the new generations that aren't following

0:23:15.560 --> 0:23:20.160
 the prudish old coverup practices,

0:23:22.200 --> 0:23:29.280
 they have dark skin and don't want to get a darker skin and so they

0:23:29.280 --> 0:23:50.800
 just for cosmetic purposes like to be protected from the sun. I used to sunburn terribly from, I guess, my 20s through my 60s.

0:23:50.800 --> 0:24:13.200
 At 7,000 feet altitude,

0:24:13.200 --> 0:24:16.520
 I found that I didn't sunburn at all.

0:24:16.520 --> 0:24:27.400
 I could work outside for hours without turning bright red. And I've heard other people say that

0:24:27.400 --> 0:24:29.000
 when they take vitamin D,

0:24:29.960 --> 0:24:33.280
 they can then expose themselves to the sun

0:24:33.280 --> 0:24:38.280
 without burning or even just a moderate degree of tanning.

0:24:41.520 --> 0:24:49.480
 So if you are avoiding the sunlight for some reason, then you absolutely need to supplement

0:24:49.480 --> 0:24:58.800
 vitamin D. It turns on all of the protective anti-inflammatory processes.

0:24:58.800 --> 0:24:59.800
 I agree.

0:24:59.800 --> 0:25:03.920
 I mean, I would love, like you said, ideally, I would love all of my clients to spend as

0:25:03.920 --> 0:25:09.040
 much time outside that they can, but it's just, it seems like I can't get people to do that.

0:25:09.040 --> 0:25:13.520
 So the next best thing is like, I find a good quality vitamin D to get them on.

0:25:13.520 --> 0:25:17.440
 And yeah, like you said, myself included, I don't burn.

0:25:18.240 --> 0:25:20.400
 Also, I think that's due to low PUFAs.

0:25:20.400 --> 0:25:25.400
 I have found that eliminating PUFAs a long time ago, I don't burn.

0:25:25.400 --> 0:25:28.840
 And I think that has a lot to do with the body's

0:25:28.840 --> 0:25:31.120
 inflammatory response with the sun too.

0:25:31.120 --> 0:25:31.960
 Would you say?

0:25:32.760 --> 0:25:37.760
 Yeah, polyunsaturated fatty acids act as an antenna,

0:25:38.560 --> 0:25:42.920
 ultraviolet light excites those molecules,

0:25:42.920 --> 0:25:52.920
 causes them to have excited electrons that then spread inflammation

0:25:52.920 --> 0:25:57.040
 to other less sensitive substances.

0:25:57.040 --> 0:26:08.100
 So they're like the antenna to spread ultraviolet damage if you have. A rabbit experiment years ago, they shaved rabbits

0:26:08.100 --> 0:26:13.100
 and exposed them to ultraviolet similar to sunlight.

0:26:14.460 --> 0:26:19.460
 And the ones, the rabbits that had a PUFA-free diet

0:26:20.540 --> 0:26:22.660
 didn't get wrinkly skin.

0:26:22.660 --> 0:26:26.680
 The ones on a high polyunsaturated fatty acid diet

0:26:26.680 --> 0:26:35.600
 got very wrinkled after exposing their skin to sun to radiation, ultraviolet.

0:26:35.600 --> 0:26:41.000
 Nice. Yeah, I know that. Go ahead, what were you going to say?

0:26:41.000 --> 0:26:45.360
 Just that there are several things that will

0:26:45.480 --> 0:26:51.760
 will sensitize you with a bad diet high in PUFA is one of the

0:26:52.560 --> 0:26:55.160
 most age promoting factors.

0:26:55.560 --> 0:27:00.080
 Absolutely. Yeah. So I wanted to ask one more thing before we

0:27:00.080 --> 0:27:03.280
 jump into questions, because in your newsletter, there was

0:27:03.280 --> 0:27:06.700
 something that stuck out to me that I kind of just briefly

0:27:06.820 --> 0:27:10.320
 touched on, but I wanted to get your thoughts on it. So you had

0:27:10.320 --> 0:27:15.360
 mentioned that, although the great majority of cancers have

0:27:15.380 --> 0:27:21.220
 clear environmental causes, the carcinogenic pollution caused by

0:27:21.220 --> 0:27:24.980
 governments and large corporations is ignored. And so

0:27:24.980 --> 0:27:27.600
 it's like putting the blame on the defective genes of the victim.

0:27:27.600 --> 0:27:31.360
 So I wanted to talk about the pollution caused by governments.

0:27:31.360 --> 0:27:40.320
 Now, I had mentioned that I am seeing data on the fact that there is grid patterns in our sky.

0:27:40.320 --> 0:27:42.160
 There's these clouds that make an X.

0:27:42.160 --> 0:27:46.300
 There's lines in the sky that they're clearly spraying something into our atmosphere,

0:27:46.300 --> 0:27:47.920
 there's published data on it.

0:27:47.920 --> 0:27:49.740
 Do you think that this is

0:27:49.740 --> 0:27:51.280
 something we need to be concerned about,

0:27:51.280 --> 0:27:53.040
 that whatever the nanoparticles that they're

0:27:53.040 --> 0:27:55.880
 spraying are dimming our sun's rays?

0:27:55.880 --> 0:27:58.800
 Is this part of that heavy metal pollution

0:27:58.800 --> 0:28:02.040
 we're exposed to depending on what they're spraying?

0:28:02.040 --> 0:28:10.960
 That has been planned research for a long time. Bill

0:28:10.960 --> 0:28:15.960
 Gates was one of the promoters of it and when the public heard about it they

0:28:15.960 --> 0:28:28.800
 said oh it's just research we don't really plan to go ahead with that, but I don't believe them. I'm sure they're continually working on it.

0:28:30.800 --> 0:28:36.080
 Yeah, I want people to be aware. I want you guys to start looking up and just doing your own

0:28:36.080 --> 0:28:41.360
 research because I think they've got us programmed to look down at our phones so we don't see what's

0:28:41.360 --> 0:28:45.200
 going on in our skies, but I highly recommend checking out

0:28:45.200 --> 0:28:50.800
 geoengineeringwatch.org because there's a lot of published data there and it's not conspiracy

0:28:50.800 --> 0:28:57.200
 because there's there's research on it. So just be aware there there's changes in our sky that

0:28:57.200 --> 0:29:02.800
 are affecting our health too and I believe some of that heavy metal nanoparticles could be part of

0:29:02.800 --> 0:29:06.760
 that carcinogenic pollution that you're talking about too.

0:29:07.920 --> 0:29:12.680
 And one source of pollution that is often forgotten

0:29:12.680 --> 0:29:16.920
 or covered up is that the Pentagon is the world's

0:29:16.920 --> 0:29:20.020
 biggest single source of pollution.

0:29:21.200 --> 0:29:24.080
 They can dump anything they want to,

0:29:24.080 --> 0:29:25.300
 anywhere they want to.

0:29:25.300 --> 0:29:32.800
 And they've killed and injured many military people.

0:29:32.800 --> 0:29:36.300
 The Gulf War syndrome was just part of it.

0:29:36.300 --> 0:29:50.720
 But burning toxic agents in open dumps in when a war is going on. The soldiers are being horribly exposed

0:29:51.680 --> 0:29:57.600
 to these toxins. Wow, yeah, something that's, I'm glad you brought that up. I'm going to look

0:29:57.600 --> 0:30:04.160
 into that too because I wasn't even aware of that. So, well, I think we will jump into questions here

0:30:04.720 --> 0:30:06.480
 because I could talk to you about this

0:30:06.480 --> 0:30:09.760
 stuff all day, but I know everybody wants me to get to their questions.

0:30:09.760 --> 0:30:13.600
 So Kylie is our first one on the list today.

0:30:13.600 --> 0:30:21.000
 She asks, or she's kind of explaining that she has low TSH, free T3 is low, free T4 is

0:30:21.000 --> 0:30:22.000
 low.

0:30:22.000 --> 0:30:26.960
 She's tried Cytomel and NDT, but immediately she lost her period. It took her five

0:30:26.960 --> 0:30:34.000
 months to get her period back while on Cytomel, but she was still hyper symptomatic, so she stopped

0:30:34.000 --> 0:30:39.520
 it. She's had thyroid issues her whole life, so she's wondering if it was her nervous system that

0:30:39.520 --> 0:30:45.520
 needed to adjust. Should she have stayed on it, or is there something else she should do, Dr. Peet?

0:30:46.960 --> 0:31:05.000
 It's important to know that the activation of the thyroid

0:31:07.440 --> 0:31:12.440
 and to make your liver able to detoxify hormones

0:31:13.080 --> 0:31:15.640
 that are in excess.

0:31:15.640 --> 0:31:19.760
 And so you can, if you have heavy menstruation

0:31:19.760 --> 0:31:24.760
 or continuous hemorrhaging, you can turn it off quickly

0:31:25.000 --> 0:31:25.140
 by increasing your T3 intake. continuous hemorrhaging, you can turn it off quickly

0:31:29.300 --> 0:31:34.300
 by increasing your T3 intake. But normally, the body produces only probably a maximum

0:31:35.820 --> 0:31:40.820
 of two or three micrograms per hour of T3

0:31:41.700 --> 0:31:44.560
 by its own conversion from thyroxine.

0:31:45.000 --> 0:31:45.320
 of T3 by its own conversion from thyroxine.

0:31:49.920 --> 0:31:54.840
 And people often, the worst thing is to start out taking maybe your whole day's dose all at once

0:31:54.840 --> 0:31:58.440
 on an empty stomach before breakfast.

0:31:58.440 --> 0:32:01.000
 And that for sure will give you,

0:32:01.960 --> 0:32:04.960
 the message goes to your liver

0:32:04.960 --> 0:32:09.120
 that you have a gigantic excess of thyroid.

0:32:09.120 --> 0:32:17.280
 And so you activate the liver to get rid of the excess thyroid. And that means that after

0:32:17.280 --> 0:32:29.080
 doing that for a while, just a couple of weeks, there's enough to see it happening. Your liver, in just 12 hours after you've taken

0:32:29.960 --> 0:32:34.960
 that one morning dose, your liver will create

0:32:35.120 --> 0:32:40.120
 extreme hypothyroidism because it has learned

0:32:40.120 --> 0:32:48.960
 to get rid of the excess, but then when you don't keep adding it, your liver pushes you

0:32:48.960 --> 0:32:58.480
 to a very low level. That's one of the reasons a mixed product like natural desiccated thyroid,

0:32:59.280 --> 0:33:06.000
 a product like Armour thyroid USP, for example, has a reasonable balance,

0:33:06.000 --> 0:33:09.840
 the same balance that you would normally produce

0:33:09.840 --> 0:33:11.100
 with your own thyroid.

0:33:12.440 --> 0:33:16.400
 Or a synthetic such as Sinoplus or

0:33:18.680 --> 0:33:19.520
 Obotrol

0:33:22.120 --> 0:33:25.000
 about four or five parts of thyroxine

0:33:25.680 --> 0:33:27.680
 to each part of T3.

0:33:27.680 --> 0:33:32.040
 So the T3 can activate your processes

0:33:32.980 --> 0:33:37.060
 and the T4 is available to continue

0:33:37.060 --> 0:33:39.000
 to keep up your T3 level

0:33:40.520 --> 0:33:44.120
 without at any time forcing you

0:33:44.120 --> 0:33:47.680
 into the hyperthyroid state that you get when you take

0:33:49.120 --> 0:33:58.080
 even 10 micrograms of SIDAML at once will give you the signal of excess that will

0:33:59.440 --> 0:34:07.440
 lead to reduced thyroid function. Yeah, and she didn't specify how much she was taking.

0:34:07.440 --> 0:34:08.480
 So that's another thing.

0:34:08.480 --> 0:34:11.960
 Maybe if she started with too high of a dose and then also

0:34:11.960 --> 0:34:15.720
 like since the NDT is going to have some T3 in there along

0:34:15.720 --> 0:34:18.400
 with the cytomel, maybe it was just too much for her and she

0:34:18.400 --> 0:34:21.760
 should just look at starting with like a really low five

0:34:21.760 --> 0:34:23.960
 micrograms of the cytomel or something.

0:34:23.960 --> 0:34:26.320
 What do you think about that?

0:34:26.320 --> 0:34:30.660
 Yeah, five micrograms with a meal is okay.

0:34:30.660 --> 0:34:34.160
 It's more than you would want on an empty stomach,

0:34:34.160 --> 0:34:37.400
 but the meal slows its absorption

0:34:37.400 --> 0:34:40.240
 over a period of about two or three hours.

0:34:41.920 --> 0:34:50.480
 And it's very important to check things like your temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure,

0:34:50.480 --> 0:34:59.880
 and so on, and to not expect things to be normal immediately.

0:34:59.880 --> 0:35:07.760
 Watch for changes to gradually increase over a period of two weeks or more.

0:35:07.760 --> 0:35:17.960
 And many people want to see quick results, and that leads up to getting very disturbed

0:35:17.960 --> 0:35:21.280
 ups and downs of the metabolic rate.

0:35:21.280 --> 0:35:25.000
 It makes it very hard to find the right level.

0:35:25.660 --> 0:35:30.660
 So traditionally, people who have really studied

0:35:32.300 --> 0:35:34.340
 thyroid function like Rhoda Barnes

0:35:35.180 --> 0:35:40.100
 would take several months usually to determine

0:35:41.140 --> 0:35:43.700
 what their correct dose was.

0:35:43.700 --> 0:35:48.680
 And the correct dose varies typically fourfold

0:35:50.900 --> 0:35:55.240
 just by seasonal changes in day length.

0:35:57.100 --> 0:36:00.640
 I found that in the winter,

0:36:00.640 --> 0:36:03.560
 I needed two grains of armor thyroid

0:36:03.560 --> 0:36:07.080
 to maintain my temperature and heart rate.

0:36:07.080 --> 0:36:10.920
 And that gradually, starting in the spring,

0:36:12.200 --> 0:36:15.940
 decreased to half a grain per day

0:36:15.940 --> 0:36:19.900
 to maintain the same level of function and metabolic rate.

0:36:21.040 --> 0:36:22.680
 Nice, yeah, that's it.

0:36:22.680 --> 0:36:24.160
 I like that you mentioned the part

0:36:24.160 --> 0:36:25.880
 about her taking it with a meal because

0:36:25.880 --> 0:36:30.520
 I think there is a misconception out there. Most thyroid medications are told to take

0:36:30.520 --> 0:36:35.600
 you know on an empty stomach right when you wake up 20 to 30 minutes before eating. And

0:36:35.600 --> 0:36:40.360
 I like that what you're saying is they really need to take it with food. I've always thought

0:36:40.360 --> 0:36:45.520
 that that would be more efficient slowing down how quickly it's absorbed.

0:36:45.520 --> 0:36:48.320
 And so that makes a lot more sense than on an empty stomach.

0:36:50.320 --> 0:36:59.040
 I've heard practically all pharmacists and doctors give that, take it on an empty stomach in the

0:36:59.040 --> 0:37:05.000
 morning recommendation. But I tried to find out what their reasoning was.

0:37:05.000 --> 0:37:08.120
 There is no reasoning.

0:37:08.120 --> 0:37:15.720
 They based their thought on how do you get efficient absorption.

0:37:15.720 --> 0:37:31.520
 They went to think about not wasting any of the thyroid. So you do get the full amount that you consumed if your stomach is empty.

0:37:32.400 --> 0:37:39.840
 It shows up in your bloodstream right away. But the thyroid never works that way naturally. It

0:37:43.400 --> 0:37:44.260
 it seeps out as you need it.

0:37:49.260 --> 0:37:50.240
 So if you have enough food to keep your blood sugar up

0:37:53.100 --> 0:37:54.060
 and your stress hormones low,

0:37:59.060 --> 0:38:00.160
 your body will continue to convert thyroxine to T3

0:38:02.020 --> 0:38:06.880
 exactly the right amount, but it is a continuous moment by moment process.

0:38:08.320 --> 0:38:17.520
 Absolutely without any biological sense to recommend taking your day's dose on an empty stomach.

0:38:18.160 --> 0:38:30.400
 Okay, so next question Zed asked, okay this is kind of a long question here. So Dr. Pete was asked in the past if he believes one can regrow hair back to their juvenile

0:38:30.400 --> 0:38:31.560
 hairline.

0:38:31.560 --> 0:38:33.720
 He replied that it may not be possible.

0:38:33.720 --> 0:38:39.080
 I would love to know if someone was willing to dedicate all of their time to this, this

0:38:39.080 --> 0:38:47.440
 is a cool guy, what further steps could be taken after addressing TSH, temperature, vitamin D, and calcium? For

0:38:47.440 --> 0:38:54.640
 example, microneedling, scalp massage, or even, you know, hanging upside down, maybe a high dose

0:38:54.640 --> 0:39:00.240
 of vitamin K to decalcify the scalp, anything that he thinks could help. Thank you so much.

0:39:02.640 --> 0:39:10.260
 Scalp massage definitely helps hair loss from a variety of causes.

0:39:10.260 --> 0:39:16.820
 Even alopecia areata can be helped by massage.

0:39:16.820 --> 0:39:25.000
 Even though that's an autoimmune spotting loss of hair, the massage helps to normalize

0:39:26.220 --> 0:39:29.900
 getting the cell energy back up.

0:39:29.900 --> 0:39:34.020
 But I've never known any single individual

0:39:34.020 --> 0:39:38.500
 who wanted to put in the necessary time.

0:39:40.380 --> 0:39:45.000
 Really could involve basically everything you do,

0:39:46.960 --> 0:39:51.280
 but it isn't benefiting only your scalp

0:39:51.280 --> 0:39:56.280
 because people, you've probably heard of the earlobe crease.

0:39:58.680 --> 0:40:03.680
 People who are bald have a very high incidence

0:40:04.600 --> 0:40:08.280
 of a crease across their earlobe.

0:40:08.280 --> 0:40:16.840
 And that crease happens to be an indicator of susceptibility to heart disease.

0:40:16.840 --> 0:40:27.280
 And so there's a known association between circulatory system health and good hair growth. So the things that

0:40:28.720 --> 0:40:37.200
 help to restore the health of your follicles are also helping every other part of your body.

0:40:38.800 --> 0:40:44.960
 I love that. I think it goes back to like grandma's logic of like brush your hair a hundred

0:40:44.960 --> 0:40:46.320
 times because people I think they're afraid when you're's logic of like brush your hair a hundred times because people

0:40:46.320 --> 0:40:49.920
 I think they're afraid when you're losing your hair, you're kind of afraid to brush your hair

0:40:49.920 --> 0:40:54.080
 because you think it's going to, you're just going to brush it and pull it out. But we just brushing

0:40:54.080 --> 0:40:58.480
 your hair, like a scalp massage, or, you know, there's a company that makes a Derma tool for

0:40:58.480 --> 0:41:02.960
 your head where you just kind of like stimulate the scalp. I think those are going to be more

0:41:02.960 --> 0:41:05.600
 beneficial because what you're doing is you're drawing blood to

0:41:05.600 --> 0:41:08.080
 that area increasing circulation. So you know, like

0:41:08.080 --> 0:41:10.960
 brushing your hair, you might, yeah, you might lose some hairs

0:41:10.960 --> 0:41:13.160
 the first few times you do it, but then you're going to start

0:41:13.160 --> 0:41:17.120
 stimulating that blood flow and hopefully improving the hairline

0:41:17.120 --> 0:41:17.880
 as well. Yeah.

0:41:19.520 --> 0:41:27.480
 Yeah, and putting your fingers on your scalp without moving them against the skin,

0:41:27.480 --> 0:41:30.200
 but wiggling your fingers

0:41:30.200 --> 0:41:32.400
 so that you're moving the skin around.

0:41:33.520 --> 0:41:36.680
 That kind of 15 minutes per day,

0:41:36.680 --> 0:41:39.400
 and that amount of massage

0:41:42.600 --> 0:41:45.000
 very significantly improve hair growth.

0:41:47.840 --> 0:41:51.720
 Getting your temperature up to normal,

0:41:51.720 --> 0:41:53.960
 I think is a big part of it.

0:41:55.480 --> 0:42:00.480
 I looked at the normal range of temperatures in the brain,

0:42:03.460 --> 0:42:07.620
 and it happens that the highest temperatures

0:42:07.620 --> 0:42:12.260
 are towards the middle and rear of the brain.

0:42:12.260 --> 0:42:15.180
 And that for best functioning,

0:42:15.180 --> 0:42:18.460
 the highest part of the brain,

0:42:18.460 --> 0:42:23.460
 the frontal lobes of the cortex

0:42:29.680 --> 0:42:30.680
 have to be slightly cooler than the central part of the brain.

0:42:30.680 --> 0:42:45.000
 They have to be able to be quiet rather than overactive. hair cover on the top and back of your head

0:42:46.880 --> 0:42:51.040
 is helping to insulate your head

0:42:51.040 --> 0:42:55.480
 so that you don't lose temperature so easily

0:42:55.480 --> 0:42:57.880
 where you have heavy hair growth.

0:42:57.880 --> 0:43:02.280
 But the fact that hair doesn't grow on the forehead

0:43:03.240 --> 0:43:05.000
 is probably associated

0:43:05.200 --> 0:43:08.700
 with the fact that your frontal lobes should be cooler.

0:43:09.680 --> 0:43:12.920
 And so your forehead is like a radiator

0:43:12.920 --> 0:43:17.800
 that helps to maintain that gradient of temperature

0:43:17.800 --> 0:43:19.400
 inside your brain,

0:43:19.400 --> 0:43:24.040
 optimizing your prefrontal cortex functions.

0:43:25.680 --> 0:43:29.120
 I really love that my brain is really warm right now

0:43:29.120 --> 0:43:32.080
 because you make me think so much.

0:43:32.080 --> 0:43:35.400
 So like just listening to you share that your knowledge

0:43:35.400 --> 0:43:37.800
 like makes my brain like feel warmer.

0:43:37.800 --> 0:43:38.960
 So that's cool.

0:43:38.960 --> 0:43:42.680
 Okay, so Zed had one more question in his email.

0:43:42.680 --> 0:43:45.300
 He said, when my heart rate increases

0:43:45.300 --> 0:43:48.100
 after exercise gets a little strenuous,

0:43:48.100 --> 0:43:52.080
 the inside of my nose becomes very cold

0:43:52.080 --> 0:43:55.540
 and painful to breathe through and almost closes up.

0:43:55.540 --> 0:43:57.660
 Does Dr. Pete know what could cause this

0:43:57.660 --> 0:43:59.000
 and how to avoid it?

0:44:00.780 --> 0:44:02.780
 Yeah, that's too much adrenaline.

0:44:04.860 --> 0:44:07.720
 I used to notice that if I was

0:44:08.720 --> 0:44:11.680
 in a study project, for example,

0:44:11.680 --> 0:44:14.840
 and went too long drinking coffee,

0:44:14.840 --> 0:44:19.680
 I would get that sensation that my nose membranes

0:44:19.680 --> 0:44:24.360
 dried out and cooled, and my sinuses

0:44:31.440 --> 0:44:33.600
 out and cooled and my sinuses extended that feeling of too much air in contact with them.

0:44:45.000 --> 0:44:49.000
 I think it's that the high adrenaline simply reduces circulation to your nose and sinus membranes. Sounds like maybe his exercise, maybe not as strenuous,

0:44:49.000 --> 0:44:54.000
 maybe just moving your body without getting too much adrenaline going, yeah?

0:44:54.000 --> 0:45:05.000
 Yeah. Not doing things that tend to raise your heart rate too much,

0:45:06.580 --> 0:45:11.580
 but the kind of muscle exercise that heats up your muscles

0:45:12.540 --> 0:45:14.940
 and then they heat your whole body

0:45:14.940 --> 0:45:16.920
 and increase the temperature.

0:45:16.920 --> 0:45:21.620
 So lifting weights or using dumbbells

0:45:22.740 --> 0:45:26.560
 enough to warm up your muscles, raise your body temperature,

0:45:28.240 --> 0:45:35.840
 won't necessarily make you breathe any harder. Yeah, excellent. I love that. Okay, so I can't

0:45:35.840 --> 0:45:49.120
 pronounce this name, but this it starts with a K, and it says, what are Dr. Pete's thoughts on high dose vitamin E? Is it safe to take up to 3,000 IUs per day?

0:45:49.120 --> 0:45:49.960
 Thank you.

0:45:52.180 --> 0:45:53.800
 There have been tests,

0:45:53.800 --> 0:45:58.800
 and it was right around 3,000 or 4,000 units a day

0:45:59.680 --> 0:46:04.140
 that would cause the vitamin E to produce diarrhea.

0:46:05.040 --> 0:46:08.280
 It was simply a physical overload

0:46:08.280 --> 0:46:11.760
 that probably irritated the intestine.

0:46:11.760 --> 0:46:15.840
 And they found that you couldn't absorb

0:46:17.960 --> 0:46:19.520
 above a certain limit.

0:46:20.680 --> 0:46:24.120
 Produced diarrhea and was useless.

0:46:24.120 --> 0:46:29.120
 But they didn't see any damage from doses up to that point.

0:46:30.040 --> 0:46:34.440
 But you have to remember that the products

0:46:34.440 --> 0:46:39.440
 they call vitamin E has changed pretty continuously

0:46:40.160 --> 0:46:44.320
 through technology, the 20s and 30s,

0:46:44.320 --> 0:46:49.920
 when it was known as a fertility vitamin. That's where the

0:46:49.920 --> 0:47:01.040
 name came from, tocopherol, offspring bearing. And so a deficiency was defined as the sterility

0:47:03.000 --> 0:47:08.000
 sterility level. And that worked because vitamin E protects against estrogen.

0:47:10.180 --> 0:47:12.680
 Estrogen is the anti-progesterone,

0:47:15.600 --> 0:47:19.320
 anti-fertility agent.

0:47:19.320 --> 0:47:23.960
 And so progesterone and vitamin E were found

0:47:25.000 --> 0:47:27.380
 in the late 1930s

0:47:32.000 --> 0:47:36.360
 to be working together to protect against estrogen and so to improve fertility

0:47:36.360 --> 0:47:40.740
 and as a side effect of many other changes.

0:47:40.740 --> 0:47:44.400
 But at that point, for various reasons,

0:47:44.400 --> 0:47:48.800
 the estrogen industry didn't want vitamin E to

0:47:48.800 --> 0:47:55.120
 be known as a pro-fertility, anti-estrogen chemical.

0:47:55.120 --> 0:48:13.440
 So they promoted the idea that it was defined as its antioxidant potency, which corresponded

0:48:13.440 --> 0:48:30.500
 to the D-alpha-tocopherol concentration. And the total vitamin E effect was considered only the antioxidant potency.

0:48:30.500 --> 0:48:51.840
 And for a time, the vitamin E value was defined as the D-alpha-tocopherol content. Now it has changed again, and so they specified the proportion of all of the

0:48:51.840 --> 0:49:07.860
 isomers of vitamin E. And the definition has changed along with it so the way it's prepared is extremely different.

0:49:07.860 --> 0:49:17.200
 For example, the octocosinol portion used to be a major part of the function, and now

0:49:17.200 --> 0:49:28.560
 that is removed, changing the consistency of the vitamin E and also apparently reducing its biological values.

0:49:28.560 --> 0:49:37.360
 So that starting 20 or 30 years ago, there has been a campaign to warn people about the

0:49:37.360 --> 0:49:45.620
 potential dangers of high intake of vitamin E. And since the benefits were established

0:49:45.620 --> 0:49:49.620
 with different products and different definitions

0:49:50.480 --> 0:49:53.100
 about 60 or 70 years ago,

0:49:54.100 --> 0:49:59.640
 we don't really have any good research evaluating what's going

0:49:59.640 --> 0:50:03.920
 on with present products of vitamin E. So I think it's best

0:50:03.920 --> 0:50:06.700
 to be very cautious with your dosing.

0:50:08.280 --> 0:50:09.960
 Very good.

0:50:09.960 --> 0:50:14.480
 Okay, so Dopa Siva or Dapo Siva maybe is the name,

0:50:14.480 --> 0:50:17.640
 asks about blackstrap molasses unsulfured.

0:50:17.640 --> 0:50:20.840
 Is it a good source of carbs, potassium and minerals?

0:50:20.840 --> 0:50:21.960
 Thinks a million.

0:50:24.720 --> 0:50:29.200
 Years ago, I noticed that it had sort of a smoky taste,

0:50:29.760 --> 0:50:38.960
 and so I investigated how it's made. And when you put your crude cane juice

0:50:40.480 --> 0:50:48.320
 through the crystallization process, the brown stuff gradually, it doesn't crystallize.

0:50:48.320 --> 0:50:53.320
 And so as you crystallize the pure sucrose molecules,

0:50:53.840 --> 0:50:58.840
 you're separating a gummy brown substance.

0:50:59.040 --> 0:51:04.040
 And it turns out that the standard way to make sugar

0:51:05.000 --> 0:51:05.100
 is to burn the cane fields It turns out that the standard way to make sugar

0:51:07.980 --> 0:51:09.060
 is to burn the cane fields

0:51:13.460 --> 0:51:18.080
 and then to cut down the bare stalks and grind that up to make your cane juice.

0:51:18.080 --> 0:51:23.080
 And if you burn the cane before you extract the sugar,

0:51:25.000 --> 0:51:25.880
 If you burn the cane before you extract the sugar,

0:51:29.520 --> 0:51:33.800
 you're going to get a lot of smoky material mixed in with the various nutrients

0:51:33.800 --> 0:51:35.520
 that produce the brown stuff.

0:51:36.480 --> 0:51:41.480
 And so heat, overexposure to heat

0:51:41.560 --> 0:51:51.800
 will also cause the amino acids in the natural cane juice to react with the glucose

0:51:51.800 --> 0:51:53.800
 in the juice.

0:51:53.800 --> 0:51:58.360
 That produces toxic brown material.

0:51:58.360 --> 0:52:08.000
 And so the brownness at least reflects the heat breakdown products involving amino acids.

0:52:08.000 --> 0:52:18.440
 And probably most often involves some smoke resulting from burning the cane.

0:52:18.440 --> 0:52:28.320
 So the fact that a lot of people are having allergy-like reaction to Boxstrap. I think it could steer

0:52:28.320 --> 0:52:36.560
 people away from it. Okay, good to know. All right, these last couple of questions here we'll take

0:52:36.560 --> 0:52:41.200
 and then we'll save the rest for next time since we're running short on time here. But these

0:52:41.200 --> 0:52:48.760
 last questions are related. They're both asthma questions. So Constantine asks, Hi, Dr. Pete,

0:52:48.760 --> 0:52:54.080
 I'm a 23 year old male, and I've had bad asthma since I was two,

0:52:54.080 --> 0:52:57.400
 my asthma is serious enough that I need to use some type of

0:52:57.400 --> 0:53:01.880
 inhaler daily. When it's very bad, I use an inhaled corticosteroid.

0:53:02.320 --> 0:53:09.000
 And when it's more manageable, I use a rescue inhaler that is androgenic agonist.

0:53:09.000 --> 0:53:11.760
 I know these are both harmful drugs to use daily,

0:53:11.760 --> 0:53:13.760
 so I would very much like to get off of them.

0:53:13.760 --> 0:53:17.600
 I've been experimenting with ciproheptadine,

0:53:17.600 --> 0:53:20.360
 pregnenolone, and progesterone as alternatives,

0:53:20.360 --> 0:53:23.480
 but none have been able to prevent me

0:53:23.480 --> 0:53:25.600
 from needing my asthma inhaler.

0:53:25.600 --> 0:53:27.520
 Do you have any ideas on what I can do

0:53:27.520 --> 0:53:30.640
 to get off the inhaler or alternatively

0:53:30.640 --> 0:53:33.060
 on what I can do to mitigate the harm done

0:53:33.060 --> 0:53:34.860
 by using the inhalers?

0:53:37.360 --> 0:53:42.360
 Checking your foods, a very careful elimination diet

0:53:53.160 --> 0:54:09.800
 A very careful elimination diet can usually identify foods that make the symptoms worse. By stimulating different parts of the intestine, researchers have found that you can produce produce all sorts of psychosomatic conditions. Everything from asthma to migraines to epilepsy

0:54:10.520 --> 0:54:15.520
 can be provoked by irritating certain parts of the intestine

0:54:15.840 --> 0:54:20.840
 and so constipation, diarrhea of some types

0:54:23.160 --> 0:54:31.440
 and anything that tends to cause pressure or irritation in the lower

0:54:32.480 --> 0:54:42.400
 intestine is a major cause of asthma. And so, looking for foods that are hard to digest,

0:54:48.800 --> 0:54:49.800
 for foods that are hard to digest, you can often get a good diet by eliminating certain foods.

0:54:49.800 --> 0:55:00.200
 For example, green salads, lettuce or spinach leaves that aren't cooked are extremely irritating

0:55:00.200 --> 0:55:08.520
 to the intestine, promote bacterial growth, endotoxin production, as well as just direct

0:55:08.520 --> 0:55:12.840
 irritation from the nature of the leaf.

0:55:12.840 --> 0:55:31.360
 And sometimes simply eliminating salads and undercooked vegetables will do it. The right kind of fiber will sometimes stop the whole problem by getting food to move

0:55:31.360 --> 0:55:38.880
 through you faster before it can reach that degree of pressure and irritation.

0:55:40.480 --> 0:55:48.000
 That's so interesting. Yeah, I would definitely second that. The gut is always a good place to go when dealing with anything

0:55:48.000 --> 0:55:54.240
 that's causing a reaction in the body as well as the how

0:55:54.240 --> 0:55:56.800
 about balancing blood sugar? Do you think that would matter

0:55:56.800 --> 0:55:59.600
 if he's going a long stretch of time without eating? Would

0:55:59.600 --> 0:56:02.320
 balancing his blood sugar, would that help the body calm

0:56:02.320 --> 0:56:07.680
 down too? Exactly. Both the chemical irritants

0:56:08.240 --> 0:56:16.800
 and the mechanical irritants are ineffective if you have high blood sugar or adequate blood sugar.

0:56:17.360 --> 0:56:25.440
 But for example, if you have an inflatable balloon in the animal's intestine.

0:56:28.400 --> 0:56:31.520
 And the animal has good blood sugar. If you blow up the balloon, nothing happens.

0:56:31.520 --> 0:56:34.960
 But if its blood sugar is a little on the low side,

0:56:36.080 --> 0:56:37.680
 you blow up the balloon,

0:56:37.680 --> 0:56:42.040
 you can produce instant asthma symptoms

0:56:42.040 --> 0:56:48.000
 because the autonomic nervous system is destabilized by low sugar.

0:56:48.000 --> 0:56:55.000
 Same with allergens. Low blood sugar makes you allergic to more things.

0:56:55.000 --> 0:57:01.000
 Yeah, I would agree with that too. So Ruth also asked a question on asthma.

0:57:01.000 --> 0:57:05.000
 She said, what are Dr. Peet's views on the use of those inhalers?

0:57:05.000 --> 0:57:09.000
 Her sleep is interrupted by hot flashes throughout the night as well.

0:57:09.000 --> 0:57:13.000
 What are your views on inhalers and why her sleep is interrupted by hot flashes?

0:57:13.000 --> 0:57:17.000
 What is interrupted by the hot flashes?

0:57:17.000 --> 0:57:18.000
 Sleep.

0:57:18.000 --> 0:57:28.320
 Yeah, her sleep is interrupted by hot flashes throughout the night? Yeah, progesterone, by maintaining your body temperature

0:57:28.520 --> 0:57:31.640
 and oxygen use during the night,

0:57:31.640 --> 0:57:36.480
 will improve the depth and restfulness of your sleep.

0:57:36.480 --> 0:57:40.560
 If your progesterone is low,

0:57:40.560 --> 0:57:43.360
 and usually if your thyroid is low,

0:57:43.360 --> 0:57:46.040
 your blood sugar is unstable,

0:57:46.040 --> 0:57:48.720
 falls too low during the night

0:57:49.680 --> 0:57:53.760
 and will trigger all kinds of symptoms,

0:57:53.760 --> 0:57:55.560
 hot flashes, night sweats,

0:57:57.280 --> 0:58:01.600
 nocturnal asthma and nocturnal epilepsy

0:58:01.600 --> 0:58:05.000
 are very well known consequences

0:58:05.320 --> 0:58:08.400
 of the falling blood sugar during the night.

0:58:08.400 --> 0:58:11.840
 Painful things become more painful at night

0:58:11.840 --> 0:58:14.040
 because of falling blood sugar.

0:58:15.580 --> 0:58:16.640
 Yeah, for sure.

0:58:16.640 --> 0:58:18.880
 Yeah, definitely the progesterone can help

0:58:18.880 --> 0:58:21.400
 with hot flashes just in general in the night.

0:58:21.400 --> 0:58:25.120
 So there was something else that you said

0:58:25.120 --> 0:58:27.320
 that made me wanna, what were you gonna say?

0:58:30.160 --> 0:58:33.760
 Experimenters have used something like a cup full

0:58:33.760 --> 0:58:38.760
 of cornstarch as a way to give pure carbohydrates

0:58:39.120 --> 0:58:43.120
 at bedtime and I found that even though

0:58:43.120 --> 0:58:45.000
 that was not good nutrition,

0:58:45.280 --> 0:58:47.440
 it would prevent the hot flashes

0:58:47.440 --> 0:58:51.900
 by giving you a constant supply of glucose during the night.

0:58:53.800 --> 0:58:54.840
 That's so interesting.

0:58:54.840 --> 0:58:57.840
 Like I've had myself included,

0:58:57.840 --> 0:59:00.560
 people mentioned that corn in general,

0:59:00.560 --> 0:59:02.140
 it seems like they sleep better

0:59:02.140 --> 0:59:03.880
 when they have corn for dinner.

0:59:03.880 --> 0:59:05.880
 Do you have any thoughts on this?

0:59:05.880 --> 0:59:08.480
 Because I don't really love corn for the fact of it does.

0:59:08.680 --> 0:59:11.600
 It seems to be a food that can elevate

0:59:11.800 --> 0:59:14.240
 blood sugar sometimes too high in certain people.

0:59:14.440 --> 0:59:17.520
 But I'm hearing that it actually can help with sleep.

0:59:17.720 --> 0:59:20.120
 Would you have any reason why?

0:59:20.320 --> 0:59:25.000
 Yeah, it doesn't have, for example, gluten.

0:59:27.080 --> 0:59:28.820
 If they're eating corn,

0:59:28.820 --> 0:59:33.820
 they might stop eating so much wheat and gluten.

0:59:33.840 --> 0:59:38.840
 And especially if the corn is in the form of tortillas

0:59:39.100 --> 0:59:42.700
 or lime processed corn,

0:59:42.700 --> 0:59:45.000
 that becomes very anti-inflammatory.

0:59:47.480 --> 0:59:52.480
 Just having some oatmeal or oat bran mush bedtime,

0:59:58.040 --> 1:00:01.800
 those are often very protective,

1:00:01.800 --> 1:00:03.280
 keeping your blood sugar up.

1:00:04.640 --> 1:00:05.840
 That's so interesting.

1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:07.240
 Yeah, I don't have corn very often,

1:00:07.240 --> 1:00:09.160
 but I find that if I have it for dinner,

1:00:09.160 --> 1:00:11.280
 like you mentioned, like homemade corn tortillas

1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:13.720
 or something, it's like my sleep is just phenomenal.

1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:15.760
 So I find that interesting.

1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:18.760
 Okay, that's all we have for today

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:20.120
 because we'll wrap up here

1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:22.140
 and we'll save the rest for next time.

1:00:22.140 --> 1:00:26.000
 But Dr. Pete, this is always so enlightening and educational

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:32.720
 and I love hearing your views on so many different topics. So we'll get to more questions next time,

1:00:32.720 --> 1:00:38.080
 but you guys check out his newsletter. That's RayPete's newsletter at gmail.com. If you missed

1:00:38.080 --> 1:00:42.800
 this one, if you haven't signed up yet, I highly recommend going ahead and ordering it and maybe

1:00:42.800 --> 1:00:49.040
 just shoot him an email. And I bet they'll send that one to you that they just put out because it is really excellent.

1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:54.480
 Dr. Pete, that carcinogenic metabolism was, was really a big eye opener. So thank you

1:00:54.480 --> 1:00:57.400
 for that. And thank you for being a part of this today.

1:00:57.400 --> 1:00:59.280
 Okay. Thank you.

1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:07.000
 Okay. Bye for now. We'll talk soon.

1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:16.680

1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:32.840
 I have clients all over the world and I love to spend time over the internet with each

1:01:32.840 --> 1:01:36.160
 one of them figuring out their specific needs.

1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:40.120
 So your specific needs, what deficiencies are you having, what symptoms are you dealing

1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:42.400
 with daily that we can address for you.

1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:49.440

 And let's set up a 15 minute free call for you, just to see if I'm a good fit for you

1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:16.320

 Again, email me, getfitwithjodell at gmail.com and let's get you set up feeling better, lose

1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:26.220

 lose those symptoms that you have hanging around,

1:02:29.500 --> 1:02:32.020
 and optimize your health as best we can.

1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:39.320
 So a common question I get is what are some of my favorite

1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:50.600
 supplements that I take daily? Well, here are my faves, just to name a few.

1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:53.960
 I love a good magnesium glycinate for stress and sleep.

1:02:53.960 --> 1:02:58.480
 I love a good multi-mineral to make sure I have all the raw materials for my thyroid

1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:00.520
 and my metabolic processes.

1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:05.980
 I like BCAAs, branched chain amino acids, when I can't get to adequate protein in the

1:03:05.980 --> 1:03:07.620
 midst of a busy day.

1:03:07.620 --> 1:03:12.980
 And I never go a day without my vitamin D3 and K2 drops under my tongue.

1:03:12.980 --> 1:03:16.660
 You know, supplements can be pricey and in a perfect world, wouldn't it be nice to have

1:03:16.660 --> 1:03:23.680
 a healthcare practitioner assign your specific supplement needs to you and find the one bio-individual

1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:25.440
 supplement needs that

1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:30.360
 match your body? Well that's where Fullscript comes in, my online supplement

1:03:30.360 --> 1:03:34.280

1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:26.920
 that there are a couple products that I can say have really moved the needle for my skin and hair and also are
