00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520
 Nothing is more expensive than bad information.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.280
 Know the source.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.320
 One Radio Network dot com.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.160
 Okay, here we go.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.040
 Welcome to part two of our show.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.040
 Hope you enjoyed that with Dr. Richard Massey.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.320
 Boy, I sure did.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.680
 The whole exosome things and the origin story and the virus.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.800
 Oh man, really, really fascinating.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.280
 Dr. Ray Peat is here and he's with us and we're very happy to have him each month.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.000
 It is the third Monday of each month around 1030 central.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.960
 I had a little trouble getting his picture together.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.960
 Sharon's going to send another one and I'll get it up so you can see what he looks like

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.920
 because he doesn't do the camera thing.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.520
 So we just do audio with Dr. Peat, which is great.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.520
 It's all that counts.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.160
 He's got some good things to say.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.080
 Ray Peat is a PhD and has been for a very long time.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.800
 He was, let me pull up his thing here, biology, University of Oregon.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.920
 He specialized in physiology and he taught schools including University of Oregon, Urbana

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.520
 College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, Universidad

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.360
 Verde Cruzana, Universidad Autonomia Unestado de Mexico, Blake College, private nutritional

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.080
 counseling for years.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.000
 His website is raypeat.com and you can do Ray Peat newsletter, I believe, it's email.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.600
 I'll ask him exactly.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.520
 I don't know why I don't remember that.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.360
 I should, Ray Peat newsletter and you get his newsletter every couple of months.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.120
 And you can email in right now, Patrick, at oneradionetwork.com or give him a call.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.680
 Dr. Ray Peat, good morning, sir.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 Good morning.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 How are things up there?

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.720
 You're on the way upper left coast, eh?

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.600
 Yeah.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:24.360
 I don't notice anything very different but I guess people are still acting pretty weird,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.840
 not going to their usual work and wearing masks and such.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.520
 Yeah.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:41.960
 We were talking about these exosomes with our last guest and I guess it was Dr. Andrew,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.080
 what was his name, the fellow up in New York that brought up the whole idea of exosomes.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.120
 So here's my understanding, let me know if I'm close, that these exosomes, they're everywhere

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.880
 and we breathe them out and breathe them in every day and this is a way that we kind of

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.160
 share, I guess, our common humanity with people and that these exosomes began to be named

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.600
 into a virus some time ago and virus has a whole connotation of being bad.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.280
 Is that close so far?

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.200
 That's close to what I believe.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:37.640
 It's not at all accepted by contemporary biologists but in the 1950s, a friend of mine was giving

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:47.760
 all of the background supporting that idea that organisms of all sorts are emitting particles

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.760
 like that.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:57.880
 They weren't called exosomes at that time but this person, Carl Lindgren, gathered up

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:07.000
 evidence that biologists had accumulated that really couldn't be explained any other way

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.760
 except for shared DNA and there's a lab in Germany now that for several years has been

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:26.320
 showing that human cells actually incorporate a certain portion of the DNA from the foods

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.880
 that we eat.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:40.040
 The particles, you know the phenomenon of presorption in which fairly big particles,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:49.000
 as big as a blood cell, for example, can pass from the intestine directly into the bloodstream

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 and exosomes are many times smaller than a cell so easily things that we eat, if they

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.880
 contain exosomes, are very likely to get into our bloodstream and once there, according

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:16.000
 to this German lab, the cell can take them up and incorporate them, possibly at some

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:27.360
 point use them, integrate them into the functioning DNA but a very, very large part of our genome,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:37.600
 so-called, well of the DNA inside the cell, our functioning genome is only a small percentage

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:48.040
 of the total DNA and the theory that we're absorbing DNA all the time would account for

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.040
 why there's all this non-functioning DNA present.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:06:00.880
 So it's possible that our species is actually, is it possible that we're actually upgrading

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.400
 everyone's DNA by breathing and that's how we're, I don't know, communicating with each

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.800
 other and helping each other?

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.960
 Yeah, but across species too.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.360
 Across species too, everybody, so animals too?

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.360
 Yeah.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.960
 Wow, man.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.040
 So is that what you believe, Dr. Peat?

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.040
 Yes.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.240
 I read that book.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.960
 It's pretty cool.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:41.960
 Over 50 years ago and it was very well documented but nothing easy to prove but very plausible.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:54.800
 So is it possible that flu viruses and cold viruses and any kind of a virus are really

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:02.400
 exosomes that we all have and we share and we run around and share with each other and

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:09.680
 these flus and colds are internal combustions and it's not something we actually get from

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.520
 some source that's not already a part of us?

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:33.040
 I think sometimes the, you know, Luke Montagnier, the Nobel Prize guy from the HIV virus dispute

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:41.480
 with the United States, he believes that organisms communicate basically by something like radio

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.560
 waves that resonate.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:54.040
 I've spent a lot of time studying the idea of resonance between organisms.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:08:03.640
 Montagnier believes it's electromagnetic waves that the DNA is tuned into.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:14.760
 I've spent most of my time thinking about the crystalline or liquid crystalline structure

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.920
 of the cell.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:27.680
 The idea of liquid crystals was developed in the '30s and '40s with evidence that there's

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.400
 long-range order within the cell.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:38.800
 It isn't just ordinary water but it's liquid crystal-like water.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:50.920
 The way you can operate, for example, a liquid crystal display screen, that's done by the

00:08:50.920 --> 00:09:09.800
 electrical control of the order in the crystal.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:22.600
 It's easy to demonstrate that it resonates to sound waves but the sound waves are not

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:29.520
 at all distinct from electronic fluctuations.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:41.200
 When you have an electrically active polarized molecule organized over the whole length of

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:49.160
 a cell, then you have the perfect conditions to resonate electronically, not just by sound

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.160
 waves.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:10:06.480
 There's a man in the U.S. who has a website called Cell Intelligence who has been demonstrating

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:16.800
 the intelligent behavior within a cell, not only of the whole cell but the highly organized

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.240
 structures of the DNA.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:30.280
 He argues that this liquid crystalline ordering system in the cytoplasm extends right into

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:42.520
 the DNA and represents the way that the needs of the cell can draw out exactly the part

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.960
 of the genome that is needed at that moment for those conditions.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.280
 That's one of the mysteries.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.200
 How does it change?

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:03.840
 When there's a change in the environment, the cell senses that and reaches in and draws

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:10.840
 out just the kind of DNA needed to change to meet those problems.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.400
 And then it's possible then as we do it and as your body does it and then you breathe

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:21.240
 it out and then you help other people to learn how to do it, I guess, right?

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.240
 Yeah.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.480
 Normally that's probably going on in a constructive way.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.960
 All the time.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:35.200
 But sometimes, for example, energy deficiency.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:43.560
 If you're badly nourished, your cell can't get the energy it needs either to maintain

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:59.600
 this very extensive organized crystal structure or to drive the selective process to pull

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.160
 out the DNA and make it properly.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.920
 Yes, without the nutrition, without the basic building blocks that we talk about.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:15.920
 Yeah, then those beneficial communicating processes can go wrong.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.360
 Instead of catching something useful, you catch a cold.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:25.400
 Oh, you mean so we could pick up some exosomes that are flying around?

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.760
 And not be able to use them properly.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.120
 Oh, and not use them.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.960
 Our system gets dumbed up.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.200
 Oh, I see.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.800
 So that's why people say, "I caught a cold."

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.640
 But it was their own internal combustion thing that created it.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:52.240
 Yeah, but the whole environment of the person governs or interacts with their energy state.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:13:02.360
 So if you're working in a stressful environment, that stress increases your risk of something

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.360
 going wrong.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.360
 Sure.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:11.040
 So then there's a, I guess what you're saying too, so then the cells and these exosomes

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:18.160
 and this exchange from organism to organism, animal, plant, I guess, and human, is happening

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:25.960
 on all levels, other than physical, and also physical, with the vibrations and the light.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.960
 Right, Doc?

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.960
 Yep.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.960
 Whoa.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.960
 That's pretty cool.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.680
 So are we back to the basics then?

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.740
 With everything that we know about everything and the way the world works, can we get so

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:47.360
 really simple if we just eat really good food, get some sunlight, get some water, get some

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.760
 exercise, we might be good.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.760
 I mean, we might be good to go.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:14:05.160
 Yeah, except there are so many factors working against all of those basic things.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.080
 Good quality food, good quality air and water.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.920
 Yeah, what does that mean, really?

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:27.240
 And then beside that, you have the direct stresses, like when you immobilize an animal,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.600
 just keeping it confined.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:38.480
 The more confined it is, the more it goes into the depressed, helpless condition.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:50.680
 And people have been confined so long by a restrictive, highly demanding economic environment

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:57.320
 that people are getting into this stress, helpless condition.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:07.320
 And animal studies show that you can bring the animal out of that helpless state, which

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:17.400
 greatly increases the likelihood of the animal giving up during a problem instead of exerting

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:26.320
 the energy that they do have, a psychological giving up and failing to use the right resources

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.320
 that are there.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:37.200
 And that accounts for things like the faith healers, just by giving them a conviction

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.200
 that there's a possibility of recovery.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.520
 It could happen.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:49.320
 Yeah, just pop right into the healthy state because they have been in this helpless, emotional,

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.720
 biological state.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:16:03.200
 And with rats, something as simple as giving them toys to play with and a bigger area to

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:14.440
 socialize with other rats, and even tickling a rat will increase its pleasure signals and

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:19.720
 help it get out of the depressed, helpless state.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:29.320
 Wow, so that could be an argument as well for say, what do they call them, confined

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.280
 animal, what are they, CAFOs?

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:39.320
 So where animals or cows could not be as healthy or as vibrant or as nutritious when they're

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.320
 confining them unnaturally.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:48.320
 Yeah, everyone needs a certain amount of play and lots of freedom.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.760
 Yeah, so that would be for dogs and cats.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.000
 I guess cats get over it.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 They just do okay living at home in the house.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.960
 I guess they adapt to it.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.000
 Yeah, even old cats like to play.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 Sure, sure.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.480
 So play is really important.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.800
 Ray Peters with us, Patrick Timpone on Radionetwork.com.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:28.240
 Wow, so how do you feel about then using things that are made in the lab like a sodium ascorbate

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:34.120
 or different magnesiums other than food to balance out nutritional deficiencies overall,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.120
 Dr. Peat?

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:40.040
 Do you think that's a reasonable thing to do?

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:50.800
 I had my own long-term experience with vitamin C starting in 1953.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:18:06.160
 At the time, it was sold as sevitamic or C-vitamic acid, but it was still the ascorbic acid discovered

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.840
 partly by Albert Santorgi.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.360
 I had heard about the virtues of it.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.240
 It was sold in 50-milligram tablets.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:29.120
 I had, for many years from the age of eight, the first time I spent any time in the woods,

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:34.240
 I was extremely susceptible to poison oak.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:49.720
 Going in the woods in 1953, I was almost incapacitated by extreme poison oak.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:57.280
 Someone told me about vitamin C. I took, I think it was just one or two of these 50-milligram

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:07.600
 tablets over the weekend and had no more poison oak reactions ever again in my life.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:18.800
 I have a slight itch if I handle it, but those 100, 150 milligrams over a weekend had that

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.520
 absolute effect.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:34.960
 When the big tablets came out in 1956, 500-milligram tablets, people were talking about it as preventing

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.640
 colds.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:43.440
 I took one tablet next morning, woke up with a sore throat and a cough.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.440
 You did?

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.560
 Just one 500-milligrams of vitamin C?

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:55.400
 Yeah, but the manufacturing process had obviously changed radically because they could sell

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:03.120
 it 10 times cheaper than what it had been just three years earlier.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:13.360
 Much of the great research done with it was in the late '40s and early '50s.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:23.320
 Ten years later, I was very impressed by Linus Pauling's argument, so I started taking it

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.320
 again.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:34.320
 I was absolutely convinced, did some experiments in the lab, found that it seemed to reverse

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:45.960
 or stop some of the hardening of the collagen in animal tissues, and so I went on taking

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.880
 it, but I had a chronic cough.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:58.000
 I went on for months, but on a trip to New York, the maid threw out my bottle of vitamin

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:09.120
 C, and so for several days, almost a week, I didn't have any, and my cough cleared up.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:14.520
 When I got a new bottle and started taking it, the cough came back.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:24.960
 I realized that it very consistently had something powerfully allergenic, and I experimented over

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.040
 the next few years.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:37.720
 I was volunteering in a clinic, and Eugene had a tremendous number of allergic people,

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:50.440
 especially because of the grass fields, burning commercial grass seed-producing fields upwind,

00:21:50.440 --> 00:22:00.160
 and so I was seeing dozens of people taking everything they knew to help their allergies,

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:09.200
 and I suggested, told them my experience, suggested they stop taking all of their supplements,

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:16.200
 and almost all of them discovered they didn't have any allergies except for their supplements.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:22.960
 What could be in some of these things, vitamin C and other supplements as we know them, that

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.920
 could be causing the allergic thing?

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.720
 Just extra things, extras that they put in there?

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.800
 No, something was happening in the substance itself.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:45.000
 A chemist, a free radical chemist, published an article describing taking chemically the

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:53.040
 purest form of synthetic ascorbic acid that was available, not from a tablet, but straight

00:22:53.040 --> 00:23:01.840
 from the, it was called reagent grade, and putting 500 milligrams in a liter of distilled

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:11.920
 water, then putting it in an apparatus that detects free radicals, and the apparatus showed

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:24.720
 that nothing but the pure vitamin C and the pure water was producing the concentration,

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:32.640
 a steady production of free radicals that a killing dose of x-rays would have produced

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.360
 shining on the water.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:41.880
 And he said, "Isn't that amazing that a person can swallow this and their stomach isn't killed

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:47.480
 the way the x-ray produced radicals would kill it?"

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:52.520
 He said that shows something about our tissue defenses.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:59.760
 So it's not the vitamin C itself, I mean obviously you get good stuff with oranges and fruit,

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.640
 it's the way that this stuff is made in the lab.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:10.160
 Yeah, I experimented drinking a gallon of orange juice and eating guavas and other extremely

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:20.400
 high vitamin C foods, and no trace of an allergy, but as little as two or three milligrams of

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:25.920
 the synthetic stuff would set off the allergy.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:39.080
 The chemist analyzed the traces, I think iron was the one he analyzed, but he said there

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:46.160
 are similar amounts of other catalytic heavy metals.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:55.240
 Just takes a few atoms of the wrong heavy metal to activate vitamin C and make it toxic.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:05.200
 And when it's produced by plants, the plants couldn't maintain it, it would decompose in

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:13.360
 free radicals if they allowed even trace amounts of these heavy metals.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:23.240
 So somehow the plants protect their vitamin C and if you eat it from a plant source, it

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.680
 goes right into your own tissues beneficially rather than harmfully.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.280
 Very interesting.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:37.400
 So we had a guest on I guess last week and we're going to talk about him a little bit.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:42.440
 He was suggesting that if you do synthetic vitamin C, that it does something to the iron,

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.840
 oxidizes it.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.760
 So that could be correct, right?

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:58.400
 The iron is reduced, the opposite of oxidation, but it takes the electron from the vitamin

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:05.320
 C and that puts the iron in a highly reactive toxic condition.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:12.520
 The iron can then give its electron directly to water, breaking down the water molecule,

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:21.520
 producing the hydroxyl radical, which is the worst indiscriminate destroyer, free radical.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.520
 Wow.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.320
 So I'm going to ask you about iron.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.120
 Let's take a little bit break because we had quite an interesting conversation about iron.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.800
 So I'm going to get your take on.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.640
 If you're on hold, you're welcome to stay there, hang in there.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.400
 We've got some things to do.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:39.560
 Patrick Cimpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.600
 Roy P. is with us.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.000
 So get your questions in.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.120
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.600
 So let's see.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.580
 Put this guy up.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:27:03.880
 I started doing shows about health and nutrition, I guess really it was in the 70s.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.520
 That's what really got me into trouble because I guess that's when I began to get fired from

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:15.720
 radio stations because I didn't know what I was doing.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.600
 I thought I was doing the right thing with telling people about stuff, but here I am

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.920
 in the middle of New Orleans where the whole thing was, you know, Mio Mio crawfish and

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:29.640
 Mio Mio and stuff like that and booze.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.640
 So I've been doing this a long time with healing stuff.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:42.200
 You could imagine the things and tools and machines and products that people have sent

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.280
 me over those, is that 40 years ago?

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.280
 I don't even know what it is.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.160
 I guess 40 years.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.160
 And lots.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.160
 And I've tried a lot of stuff.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.040
 Experimented with a lot of stuff.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:05.080
 But I'll tell you, the hydrogen technology with this machine that I've been on about

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:11.040
 a year, breathing the browns gas and drinking the water, I can, there's no doubt that this

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:19.320
 has been one of the most powerful things that I've done ongoing other than God.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.640
 Because that's the number one.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:32.920
 That I know you and I can heal, the body can heal through divine spirit without anything.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.760
 So that's my number one.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:39.920
 But there are tools that we are given that we can use, maybe food-based vitamin C or,

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.600
 I don't know, things, you know, food-based things that we promote that we think are good

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.900
 like pine pollen, some food.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.320
 But this hydrogen, there's something going on with this.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.960
 It's pretty magical.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:29:00.600
 You can go to molecularhydrogeninstitute.com and look at hundreds and hundreds of peer-reviewed

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.040
 studies on hydrogen.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:09.400
 And Browns Gas, the machine that we promote, AquaCure, is even a step above because it

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:14.440
 does something fun with the water that I'm just not quite sure.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.840
 There's a lifetime warranty on this machine.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.560
 There's a one-year, no questions asked, money-back warranty.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.840
 So if you don't like it, you can use it for eight, nine months and send it back and get

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.960
 back your two grand.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.360
 What's up with that?

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.800
 George Wiseman makes them.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.000
 George will be on the show soon.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.760
 Pretty incredible stuff.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.760
 Patrick Flanagan was onto the hydrogen thing.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:42.080
 There's many people out there selling little plop-plop fizzes to get more hydrogen in your

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.240
 body.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.240
 But that's great.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.160
 I'm not going to be, but breathe the gas and drink the hydrogen water that you make at

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.320
 home.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:56.360
 We have several emails and I can see some of it myself.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.200
 Some of my hair is coming back to a normal color.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:05.800
 I mean I started doing the gray thing 30 years ago and other people too.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:11.520
 So there's something pretty special going on with hydrogen purported to be one of the

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.040
 number one antioxidants on the planet.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.360
 Now there's a lot of ways you can get it.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.120
 Your body makes hydrogen.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.120
 You don't need a machine.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.920
 You're not going to die without it.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.920
 Don't worry about it.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.920
 It's not going to cure COVID.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.200
 You know, we don't say any of that stuff.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.160
 These are just tools that are just kind of God-given.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.880
 If you got the box and you want to do it, play with it, I think you're going to feel

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.200
 better and help you.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.040
 But you don't need it.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.720
 Body makes hydrogen with good food.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.240
 It's the way with all these things.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.400
 You don't need anything extra.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.880
 If you don't have any money, don't worry about it.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.880
 Get out in the sun, eat the best food you can, you'll be fine.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.360
 That's just my take anyway.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.760
 I, you know, I just, you know, whatever.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.920
 So this is the hydrogen machine.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.840
 You can go on oneradionetwork.com.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:06.360
 You click an order, click an order, hydrogen machine, and then I use promo code oneradio,

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:14.160
 oneradionetwork.com, oneradionetwork.com, promo code oneradio.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:20.640
 Previously we were talking with Brandon about the Blue Shield EMF device, and he says it

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.080
 goes out 90 yards in all directions.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:28.800
 It's an omnidirectional field that if you think about a huge sphere that's expanding,

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.960
 that's essentially what the waveform pattern looks like.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.960
 That's cool.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:39.400
 So it's putting frequencies into the body, and then how does that work in relation to

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.280
 electromagnetic field that's coming in the walls and the windows through a cell phone

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.280
 tower down the street?

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.000
 Yeah, so the cell repeaters and Wi-Fi and all this electromagnetic radiation in the

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.560
 environment, people mistakenly think that this is somehow going to act like a shield

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:58.280
 and block the radiation and make it not appear on any kind of tri-field meter or any measuring

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.280
 device.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.440
 And that's simply not the case.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:05.920
 It's more of an energy medicine, so to speak, where it's stimulating the bodies at the cellular

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:10.640
 level to create a cellular response to make all the individual cells much stronger and

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.240
 more able to adapt to the EMF stressors.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:18.360
 So that's number one on the physical or the somatic level where the body's experiencing

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.560
 a decrease in stress from electromagnetic fields.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.700

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:58.320
 Well, it's an honor to have Dr. Ray Peat, PhD, RayPeat.com.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.320
 And your newsletter is Ray Peat's Newsletter, right?

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.320
 Ray Peat's Newsletter?

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.320
 Ray Peat's?

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.920
 Yeah, Ray Peat's with an S. S, newsletter.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:13.520
 Not dot com, but email, at gmail.com.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.520
 Right.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.880
 Ray Peat's Newsletter, plural, at gmail.com.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.040
 And it comes out every couple months.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.320
 When's the next one coming out?

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:30.160
 Last month is going to come out at the end of this week.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.160
 And what's it about?

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.160
 The big...

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:40.200
 Education and what the virus situation is doing to education.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.200
 Wow.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.080
 I guess a lot.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.640
 Shutting it down, basically.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.280
 Yes, sir.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:34:01.120
 I met with the Gates Foundation people and Eric Schmidt, the former, for many years,

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:08.720
 CEO and chairman of Google, working for the Pentagon.

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:16.920
 He was saying, and his commission was saying, over a year ago, that schools basically have

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:25.800
 to be shut down because they're expensive and it's much cheaper to do it over the internet.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:33.600
 And just this year, he met with Cuomo and Cuomo said, "Yeah, what are all these buildings

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.600
 and classrooms for?

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.920
 We don't need them if we have the internet."

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.920
 Fascinating.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:46.080
 Even in Austin, I just heard that I think they're going to do online schools for the

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:50.840
 first maybe six weeks and then see how it goes.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.280
 But Dr. Peat, they keep testing people, more and more people.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.320
 And as you know, if you get a positive test, they think you have some unique, virulent,

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.480
 deadly communicable disease.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:12.160
 I think that testing the so-called incidence of disease goes up in proportion to how many

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.000
 tests they give.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:22.920
 And it isn't really anything to do with suffering from cold symptoms or any symptoms at all.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.600
 It's just the number of tests they're doing.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:38.360
 I think it's at this point consisting of a sales campaign for computers and the education

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.680
 so-called systems.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.480
 You know who B.F. Skinner was?

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.480
 Yeah, kind of know B.F.?

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.080
 Yeah, a little bit about him.

00:35:49.080 --> 00:36:00.960
 The behavioral psychologist argued that the concept of mind should be removed from science

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:12.320
 and education, that machines can restrict our behavior so that we give only the right

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:20.960
 behavior, no complex questions asked.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.580
 The student could be a pigeon.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:32.760
 You can get the pigeon to suppress all of its normal movements and give only the desired

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.760
 of pecking a certain switch behavior.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.800
 That's the principle of Skinnerian education so-called.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:50.840
 And exactly those principles are now forming the basis of online education.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:37:00.160
 They want to make training more efficient so that you don't push any of the unwanted

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.080
 responses.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:08.560
 You push only the right button and give the right answers.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.520
 So it's basically a mindless training system.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.040
 To just know, remember things and then repeat them on test.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:24.280
 I guess to your newsletter I'm sure you talk about the idea of then parents who are all

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.120
 set up to go to work, right?

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.120
 What are they going to do?

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.720
 And the kids need touch, right?

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:35.000
 And working with people and seeing other kids, I mean that's a whole other stress level on

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.400
 them, isn't it?

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:44.120
 One CEO summed it up very simply.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:50.600
 She said humans are biohazards, machines aren't.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:58.400
 They want to take humans out of the equation, turn everything into a robot production.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:03.840
 Dr. Ray Peters, if you're on hold, sorry, but I want to do this and then we'll begin

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.680
 doing some questions.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.880
 There was a fellow on that seemed like he was pretty well researched and he was a fellow

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:16.920
 talking about iron that I mentioned and the vitamin C issue that you confirmed.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:24.000
 And he was suggesting that early on, I don't know, 40s and 50s, somebody convinced people

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.040
 to start putting iron in our food, right?

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.000
 And iron enriched flour and things like that.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.880
 And then even increased that I think around 1980 or so, they wanted to do more.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:43.840
 And then when we have too much iron in our body, then that contributes to lower copper

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:51.040
 and then the iron can then rust and cause problems.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:54.280
 Do you think that most of us have too much iron?

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.680
 Is it possible in our body?

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.080
 Yeah.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:02.200
 Men steadily accumulate it through life.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:15.640
 The exceptions are starving in famine zones, for example, where no one gets any meat or

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.720
 eggs or seafood.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:26.640
 But everyone eating a good normal diet, the men steadily accumulate it.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:34.320
 And the incidence of heart attacks and heart disease, for example, correspond directly

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.600
 to the level of accumulated iron.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:46.640
 So men are well ahead of women up to the age of 50 or so because women are getting rid

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.640
 of some iron every month.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.640
 Menstruation, right?

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:56.760
 Just an ounce or so of blood is enough to keep the iron down.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:06.120
 But after menopause, women start accumulating iron like men and they actually catch up with

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:11.720
 men because of the slight difference in the hormones.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:19.160
 Estrogen makes you accumulate iron up to 10 times as fast as a man does.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:28.840
 So, then, well, so where do we get so much iron?

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:33.760
 And if we're eating organic foods and not iron-enriched flour, you know, and those kind

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:40.440
 of things, we're not really getting extra iron in our food, are we?

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:47.160
 Meat is always a very rich source of iron.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:57.880
 So if you eat any meat every day, it's likely to be adding to your iron excess.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:06.000
 And meat also has too much phosphate relative to calcium and magnesium.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:14.600
 And the combination of high phosphate and high iron tend in the same direction to produce

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:18.120
 stress and pre-radical damage.

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:22.640
 So it would be heavy meat eaters or have more iron?

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:29.240
 What other segment of the world, what are they eating?

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:34.240
 Anything in particular that ups the iron?

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:45.000
 Iron in food was being tampered with, adding iron and synthetic vitamins and such.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:56.080
 Even people who ate oatmeal and bread and rice, for example, were getting too much.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:04.000
 So what's the iron's connection to heart issues, too much iron?

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:14.560
 I think it's almost entirely the same thing that the free radical chemists saw.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:21.080
 When you're under stress, you don't need the vitamin C as a catalyst.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.880
 There are many other sources of electrons.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:35.600
 In fact, anything that interferes with oxidation is going to tend to put any iron stores that

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.280
 had been tucked away safely in your cells.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:47.800
 When you don't have oxygen sucking up all the stray electrons, a stray electron will

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:52.360
 activate iron that had been harmless.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:43:01.480
 So the stress creates electrons that activate the iron the same way synthetic vitamin C

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.800
 activates the iron.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:09.120
 So our stress response lowers the oxygen, and then that causes the oxidation of the

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:14.360
 iron that was okay until we got stressed out.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:23.560
 The iron becomes the active ferrous form, where the ferric form can be safely stored.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:31.120
 The ferrous form creates the hydroxyl radical, the most toxic free radical.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:42.920
 Then that damages DNA, creates detectable mutations, and turns on the whole inflammation

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.760
 process.

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.200
 And then what's the connection with iron and copper?

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:58.880
 Copper is a stronger oxidant than iron is, and so when stress creates the ferrous form

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:04.840
 of iron, copper can turn it back into ferric iron.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:16.560
 So copper defends against activated iron by putting it back into the passive storage form.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:22.760
 So the copper just helps the iron not to get toxic and harmful.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:29.800
 But then doesn't iron lower the copper levels too much?

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:38.920
 It probably does by competition, but I think it's more likely that stress is causing you

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:50.280
 to be unable to retain the copper efficiently, giving the iron a chance to butt in and knock

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.760
 the copper out of the place it should be.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:45:03.640
 So it's both too much iron and too much stress that makes us lose copper.

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:11.800
 When you start a free radical type of stress, we put out a protein called metallothionein

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:17.200
 that has sulfur in it that sticks to heavy metals.

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:26.280
 And we put that out to defend against all of these toxic heavy metals, but in the process

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:32.280
 it tends to carry away the good copper as well.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:41.840
 Copper binds strongly, so if you're poisoned by mercury, you'll produce metallothionein

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:50.000
 and it will also carry out some zinc and copper, which is not good.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:59.440
 Some folks think that things like beef liver, nuts and mushrooms are high in copper and

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.120
 advisable to have some in our diet.

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.920
 And then also to maybe give blood.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.400
 What do you think about giving blood a couple of times a year?

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:15.480
 Several studies have found that people are healthier who give blood occasionally.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:16.480
 Occasionally.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.480
 What would you think?

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.760
 Do you give blood yourself at all?

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.760
 No.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:27.200
 I just don't like to be around doctors and needles.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.200
 That's right.

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.200
 I understand.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.840
 Who wants people poking you?

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.880
 So you don't, I kind of hear you saying it doesn't sound like you really advise it or

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:41.880
 it's necessary to blood thing, but it's not going to hurt anyone to give blood a couple

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.440
 of times a year, certainly.

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:47.960
 No, it's probably beneficial for most people.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:47:00.760
 After you get around 50 years old or so, things like the exosomes tend to circulate in your

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:09.800
 blood after a certain age, they can start having an age promoting effect rather than

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.840
 a reparative effect.

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:20.200
 And so losing some of your old exosomes is probably part of what happens when an old

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.320
 person donates blood.

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.120
 I see.

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.600
 So here's an interesting email.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.120
 This is great.

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.240
 This is from Gloria.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.200
 She says, "I would like to give blood.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:37.600
 I heard Morley Robbins on Patrick's show, but I'm only 100 pounds and they won't let

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.640
 me give blood because I'm too skinny.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.120
 They think I am.

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:47.840
 And how can I get rid of any extra lead, I mean iron in my body?"

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:54.840
 Oh, stopping eating is the most important thing.

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.080
 Stop eating iron enriched foods.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:03.120
 Yeah, and cut way back on meat.

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:09.120
 One or two eggs a day will provide the essential iron that you need.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:19.640
 And emphasizing milk and cheese, for example, are notoriously iron deficient.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:29.640
 And so the extent to which your major calories come from cheese and milk, you're effectively

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.520
 subtracting iron from your body.

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.080
 Oh, you're actually taking some away.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:42.080
 Yeah, we're shedding it all the time from our intestines and skin cells.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:47.200
 Ayurvedic medicine, who I've kind of played around with for many years, Dr. Peat, they've

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:54.480
 often recommended taking a really nice copper kind of water thing and taking a little water

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:59.040
 that's been sitting in the copper vessel once a day or so.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.800
 What do you think about that?

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:05.240
 I think it's probably helpful.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:16.280
 You don't want to combine copper with any reductant, vitamin C or otherwise.

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:29.520
 In your stomach, copper or iron can oxidize fatty acids, vitamins, other essential nutrients.

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:38.280
 So you don't want free copper combined with food in the form of pure water on an empty

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.280
 stomach.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.280
 I think it's helpful.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:44.040
 Okay, do it on an empty stomach and leave it alone for a bit.

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:55.240
 So there are some nice food-based cherries and some pretty good things organic with vitamin

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.240
 C.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:03.320
 Do you think it's advisable or healthy to take some of those food-based vitamin C's

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:06.000
 extra every day?

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.360
 I tested myself.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:20.000
 When I stopped taking any synthetic vitamin C, I found that my urine contained around

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:28.200
 3,000 milligrams per day months after I stopped any supplement.

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:38.720
 I realized that the only foods that don't contain any vitamin C are grains, seeds, and

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.880
 nuts.

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:47.360
 Everything else basically, all the way from algae and potatoes.

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.360
 They have vitamin C.

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:58.160
 Clams, turnip, turnip greens are a great source.

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:05.960
 All living forms basically except humans, gorillas, and chimpanzees produce their own

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:06.960
 vitamin C.

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:15.200
 So seafood and vegetables and fruits all contain as much as we need.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:21.560
 I guess some of the oysters and shrimps and lobsters, they have a lot of good copper in

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.560
 there, right?

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.040
 If you want more copper too?

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:30.120
 Yeah, oysters are a very good source of copper.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:37.440
 So what would be some of the symptoms, Dr. Ray Peat, of someone who maybe doesn't want

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:43.080
 to do this test and find out about the iron load?

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:46.600
 Would there be some symptoms that somebody might say, "Oh, I might have too much iron.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.920
 I want to do more copper."

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:52.880
 Is there any symptoms that come up right on the top for you?

00:51:52.880 --> 00:52:04.160
 Well, the most studied is heart disease symptoms, but any of the degenerative things are activated

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:10.480
 by iron, inflammation, loss of muscle mass, for example.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:16.120
 Please, Dr. Peat, could you repeat what you said about hydroxyl, please?

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:22.720
 I was wondering if it's a byproduct of vitamin C. You said it is very good for something.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:30.440
 I can't help but notice it is the first part of the anti-malaria drug being touted by many

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:36.920
 doctors, hydrochloric acid.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:41.440
 When it's attached to a molecule like that, it's fine.

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:45.280
 It isn't a reactive free radical.

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:55.920
 But when something like ferrous iron in the cell contacts water, it creates a free hydroxyl

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:56.920
 radical.

00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:08.320
 An attached hydroxyl radical is part of everything normal like sugar is full of attached hydroxy

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.480
 particles.

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:21.400
 Inside the cell, about a ratio of eight to one of the vitamin C isn't in the form of

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.800
 ascorbic acid at all.

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:33.320
 The cell turns it into dehydroascorbate.

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:43.600
 About 80 or 85% of the vitamin C in our bodies doesn't show up in a test.

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:53.800
 It gives people the impression that meat and seafood and some plants don't contain any

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:57.960
 vitamin C when it's actually there in the form of dehydroascorbate.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:10.920
 Dehydroascorbate works like oxygen to protect against the excess electrons.

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:22.480
 If you take in a huge amount of any reducing material, which could be ascorbic acid or

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:32.800
 the various things that have been advertised as antioxidant supplements, those contribute

00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:44.280
 potentially toxic electrons that can produce the hydroxyl radical if they reach an excess

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.840
 level in your stomach and bloodstream.

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:59.200
 Because where they're really going to do their work is inside the cell in the oxidized form.

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:09.120
 Many of the flavonoid chemicals in oranges, for example, and guavas and vegetables and

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:21.440
 fruits, the colored yellow pigmented or orange pigmented molecules, historically they've

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:28.680
 been called antioxidants like vitamin C. But like dehydroascorbate, when they get in the

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:38.360
 cell they are functioning as oxidants working with oxygen to defend you against the stress

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:42.480
 induced free radical excess electrons.

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:48.360
 Wow, man, holy cow, that's pretty geeky stuff.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:53.800
 Patrick Timpone, really great stuff with Dr. Ray P. on Radionetwork.com.

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:58.600
 We're having a little bit of interruption with our stream.

00:55:58.600 --> 00:55:59.840
 Don't worry about it.

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:06.080
 The podcast will be available in its entirety.

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:09.000
 We're working with it.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.760
 Just hang in there and all is well.

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.640
 Patrick at one, Radionetwork.com.

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:23.280
 Let's see, here's something for you, Doc, with Chandra.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:29.520
 She mixes up a little bit of potassium chloride, some sodium chloride, some salt, baking soda,

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:34.600
 and some epsom salts, like a little bit of each, a half teaspoon or so.

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.200
 She drinks this throughout the day.

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:41.920
 Can Dr. Peat talk about the pros and cons of this concoction?

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:49.600
 If it agrees with you, then the chemicals are probably pure.

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:58.920
 You don't want a very large amount of potassium chloride because an overdose can give you

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.800
 low blood pressure or even stop your heart.

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:08.920
 So the potassium chloride is one you want to not overdo.

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:18.360
 But athletes, to improve their endurance, can take a tablespoonful of baking soda in

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:28.440
 a glass of water before they are going to bicycle 20 or 50 miles or something to improve

00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:35.440
 their use of oxygen and sparing their glucose for energy.

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:36.440
 Okay.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:42.080
 Here is somebody, Dr. Peat, Jeremy.

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:48.240
 He said he's lost his sense of taste and smell and has come up with a lot of unique

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:55.400
 symptoms that people as well as some other people I know are experiencing.

00:57:55.400 --> 00:58:02.280
 Does Dr. Peat have any ideas if this COVID could be causing this?

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:12.760
 A lot of stress inducers can cause, like I mentioned, the metallothionein protein is

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:18.040
 increased by stress of any sort.

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:26.760
 Anything that it can carry out of the body and produce a deficiency of zinc is one of

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:34.440
 those and the deficiency of zinc has been connected with the loss of smell and probably

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:36.640
 taste.

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:42.280
 So when we do extra things like a good living source calcium, we have a nice one that's

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:51.680
 oyster, not oyster but pearls, or other things like magnesium, things like that.

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:59.280
 Do we risk getting things out of balance if we don't do it carefully?

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:02.080
 No.

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:09.960
 Oyster shell and egg shell calcium carbonate is very safe.

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:19.720
 If you take too much, just any pure chemical is going to be rejected by your stomach and

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.600
 intestine.

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:33.200
 A concentrated potassium chloride tablet, for example, has been known to effectively

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:42.480
 burn a hole into the stomach or intestine because the potassium chloride relaxes the

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:52.240
 intestine and then the concentrated pill sits there disturbing the water balance of the

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.980
 cells.

00:59:53.980 --> 01:00:05.980
 Any concentrated large dose of table salt or vitamin B1, anything in a high concentration

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:10.160
 can disturb your stomach and intestine fairly seriously.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.260
 Very interesting.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:18.540
 Here is someone that lives in a condo upstairs.

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:21.460
 They're smoking.

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:29.780
 I've been having high histamine reaction symptoms and I feel stress and things like that.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:37.980
 Is there anything that I can do possibly to improve the air?

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:44.020
 I guess, have you ever seen any of these air purifiers, Dr. Peat, that work good?

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:50.660
 Yeah, they're almost always crazily overpriced.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:59.460
 An ultraviolet, a very strong ultraviolet lamp, if you don't look at it, it will produce

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:10.420
 some ozone and destroy viruses and bacteria in the air and to a certain extent detoxify

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:19.380
 some of the organic toxins if it's a fairly small space.

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:27.420
 Having a fan and the filter combined with a strong ultraviolet bulb, that's the basis

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:34.380
 for some of these air cleaning things that they often sell for $1,000.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.380
 You can do it yourself.

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:36.380
 Yeah, you can do it yourself.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.380
 You can figure it out.

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:46.020
 My 14-month-old granddaughter has eczema.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:51.380
 It seems like she scratches herself so much it's hard to see and prevent her from scratching

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:55.500
 anything that we could look at.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.060
 How old was she?

01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:00.660
 14 months.

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:07.780
 If the baby is still nursing, sometimes it's the mother's diet that contains an allergen

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:15.860
 that gets into the milk and creates a skin problem in the baby.

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:22.500
 So if she's breastfeeding, the mother should carefully check her diet.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:34.460
 And if the baby is eating foods, consider eliminating one food at a time for a week

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:38.700
 or so and see if that clears it up.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:44.960
 John wants to know, people are advocating eating grass-fed beef liver for copper and

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:52.300
 other nutritional requirements.

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:56.220
 How would it make sense and how often do we eat beef liver?

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.220
 It depends.

01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:04.900
 If you're over 50, for example, you don't want to overdo the liver because of the high

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.540
 iron content.

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:22.220
 For those people, shrimp, squid, clams, lobster, crabs, all the shellfish.

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:28.900
 Their blood consists of copper protein rather than iron-containing hemoglobin.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:34.780
 So they're a reliable source of a high concentration of copper.

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:40.820
 But it's interesting, some of the iron people talk about eating the beef liver because it's

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:46.700
 so high in copper which will lower the iron, but you said it's high in iron as well.

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:54.300
 Yeah, so you don't want to, I think something like two or three ounces a week is about all

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:58.300
 an older person would want.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:02.300
 This is from Cecilia, she's in Connecticut.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:08.540
 Can you ask Dr. Peat if he has been studying astrology, is there going to be something

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:14.700
 monumental happening with our sun and planets that could affect our world drastically come

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.680
 this fall?

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.060
 Can he give any insights?

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:30.220
 I don't know of anything that precise in time, but there have been some good physicists who

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:39.060
 have looked at the solar cycles and the annual changes in heat production coming out of the

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:41.620
 sun.

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:55.580
 For many years, the basic sun science has tended to predict an oncoming ice age with

01:04:55.580 --> 01:05:03.000
 occasional fluctuations into overheating.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:11.560
 Sunspot cycles affect the heat output of the sun, but the general drift of predictions

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:19.200
 has been that the sun is going to cool off for hundreds of years, starting anytime in

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.000
 the next several years.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.320
 That would be kind of nice here in Texas, we could use a 20 degree drop, that would

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.200
 be fine with me.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.880
 This is from Eric, he's in Finland.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.800
 Hello Patrick and Dr. Peat.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:39.800
 Last month, Dr. Peat referred to the influence of Professor John Beard and Dr. William Donald

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.880
 Kelly's cancer protocol.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:49.160
 This time, please give us insight on how Kelly and Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez were able to know

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:56.200
 how to balance the automatic nervous system via the diet and supplements so we, the average

01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:02.840
 person, can also achieve this balance on our own as a method to cure disease and maintain

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:08.720
 our health.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:17.080
 Keeping your blood sugar steady is the basic thing for regulating the balance between parasympathetic

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:21.480
 and sympathetic.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:30.880
 Every day around sunset, but especially if we lie down in the dark, the nervous system

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:39.840
 shifts strongly to the parasympathetic side and then at sunrise, for various reasons,

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:48.160
 it shifts back to the sympathetic or adrenaline dominated side.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:57.640
 With old age, the tendency is to exaggerate the downturn, the parasympathetic side, and

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:06.800
 it happens that many tumors grow fastest during the night and are stimulated by the hormones

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:13.120
 that control the parasympathetic side.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:21.520
 That's one of the things that the Kelly-Beard program does working on the pancreas.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:30.120
 They emphasize the proteolytic enzymes as getting into the bloodstream, not just into

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:37.080
 the intestine, but it's now confirmed that the proteolytic enzymes secreted into the

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:45.600
 intestine, a significant amount of that is absorbed directly into the bloodstream.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:53.840
 So a well-functioning pancreas is producing an increase of proteolytic enzymes in the

01:07:53.840 --> 01:08:02.880
 bloodstream that, according to their approach, protects against the incipient cancer, especially

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.440
 in the reproductive system.

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:12.800
 That was Beard's approach that Kelly based his thinking on.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:23.280
 The fact that the parasympathetic system increases cell division and produces conditions that

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:36.280
 exacerbate inflammation, for example, any pain syndrome usually is most intense between

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:47.320
 2 a.m. and 5 a.m., and mortality is generally greatest in the early morning hours because

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:55.960
 of that shift towards excessive parasympathetic activity.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:02.760
 Keeping your pancreas under control so it doesn't produce too much insulin is a very

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:10.840
 important part of avoiding that age-related nocturnal inflammation.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:11.840
 Interesting.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:17.560
 But you've not been shy about your use of and talking about sugar with orange juice

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:27.200
 and even beet sugar and things.

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:33.680
 What is not happening in the body where people do that, their blood sugar goes imbalanced

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:38.640
 or they have a fasting blood sugar that's 130 or 140 or something?

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.920
 Is that a pancreas issue?

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:51.680
 Partly, but it's generally that something is causing a block to the oxidation of the

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:56.880
 glucose and too much fat in the diet, especially polyunsaturated fat.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:57.880
 The poofers.

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:05.840
 Yeah, the fats compete with the sugar and stress increases the release of fat into your

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:11.360
 bloodstream and that happens at night.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:22.240
 Always the falling blood glucose calls out from storage the free fatty acids and that's

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:32.520
 one of the reasons, darkness and long nights of winter, why aging happens.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:38.560
 Almost all human aging happens during the night and when the nights are long in the

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:48.240
 winter, the aging process has more hours every day to act.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:56.160
 The lowering of the blood sugar and increase of free fatty acids during the night is part

01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:00.600
 of what drives that degenerative stress.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:09.760
 So if you wake up after four hours of sleep, for example, and renew your muscle and liver

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:19.440
 glycogen stores and brain glycogen with a glass of milk and orange juice, for example,

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:26.600
 that will interrupt the stress and let you get back to some restorative sleep.

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:31.640
 So that could be two go-to things for people to take at night if they wake up or before

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:35.040
 bed, milk and/or orange juice.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:41.960
 Yeah, there have been studies in which just a glass of warm or room temperature milk at

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:49.600
 bedtime interrupts some of the most important stress hormones that rise at night.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:55.160
 You know, it's interesting, this is anecdotal and not that what happens to me just means

01:11:55.160 --> 01:12:01.440
 anything to you out there, but Dr. Peat, I've been drinking lots of orange juice since talking

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.440
 to you.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:05.000
 It's so fresh, you know, the good stuff.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.800
 And my little blood sugar, boy, it's dead on 80 when I wake up and if I take it, you

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.720
 know, the fasting blood sugar.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:15.360
 So where's all that sugar going?

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.360
 Where's it all going?

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:19.320
 I mean, there's a lot of sugar in orange juice, right?

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:26.760
 Yeah, and it happens that orange juice has several things that reduce the work of the

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:36.120
 pancreas, the high potassium concentration, for example, in orange juice takes care of

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.800
 the insulin problem.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:44.680
 Your pancreas doesn't have to make much insulin at all if you're drinking orange juice because

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:49.920
 the potassium handles it instead of needing insulin.

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:58.080
 And then there are all of these flavonoids, the yellow pigments that block stress reactions

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:04.720
 and work like oxygen in the tissues.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:11.040
 One of the functions of insulin is to keep your fatty acids in place in your tissues

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:16.720
 so they don't block your ability to oxidize glucose.

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:20.960
 And these flavonoids have exactly that function.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.120
 They keep the cell able to keep oxidizing glucose.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.120
 Interesting.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:32.960
 And so what causes the free fatty acids from not doing their thing in the middle of the

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:33.960
 night?

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:34.960
 What causes that?

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:38.400
 What would we eat that would turn those guys off or do?

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.200
 Stress obviously would be one, I guess.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.640
 Calcium is the other.

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:50.040
 And to a certain extent, you don't want to take a spoonful of salt.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.440
 That would hurt your stomach.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:59.600
 But just some salty things like pork rinds or salty tortilla chips or something at bedtime

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:04.200
 and a glass or two of milk.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:15.520
 Both calcium and sodium help to activate the prefer oxidative energy production in the

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:22.640
 cells which normally they're impeded during the night by the free fatty acids.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:31.960
 And the combination of sodium and calcium will lower the stress hormones, especially

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:32.960
 parathyroid.

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:33.960
 Lower.

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:43.520
 And those parathyroid hormone, every night it rises and blocks your mitochondrial oxidative

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.520
 processes.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:52.320
 So the milk is, if you have enough vitamin D in your system, the calcium from the milk

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:59.880
 is in effect activating your mitochondria, restoring their ability to keep running even

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:02.480
 in the presence of some fatty acids.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.480
 So let me see if I understand.

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:08.040
 So the salt is good, the salt before bed?

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.040
 A little bit.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.040
 A little bit.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.040
 Yeah.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.040
 A little bit.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.640
 And then if you get a good source of calcium, that could also help everybody be happy all

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.360
 night before bed.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.360
 Yeah.

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:25.120
 Those work together to hold down the stress hormones and let your mitochondria function.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:32.160
 Darkness in all animals that have been studied, the longer the darkness, the more the mitochondria

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.160
 deteriorate.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:45.000
 And that's a combination of many things, but especially the rising fatty acids and parathyroid

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.440
 hormone.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:55.280
 So the longer, so if people tend to sleep more during the winter just because it's dark,

01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:00.680
 it's actually, they're not getting a lot of benefit out of that, are they?

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:01.680
 Yeah.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:09.000
 Being awake during a long winter night, it's worse than being asleep.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.720
 Oh, is it?

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.720
 Yeah.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:19.040
 If you're going to have several hours of good, restful, deep sleep, that minimizes the damage

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:20.040
 to the mitochondria.

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.040
 I see.

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:29.400
 And if you have to work during the night, you don't get the protective effect of deep

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:30.400
 sleep.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:39.920
 So it's still going to cause damage to the mitochondria to be in the dark, but it's better

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.320
 to pass the darkness in sleep.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.520
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us, Patrick Timpone on Radionetwork.com.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.320
 We got started a little bit late.

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.360
 Can you hang around for a few minutes, Dr. Peat?

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.360
 Okay.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.360
 You okay?

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.360
 Good.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.360
 This is Kane in Bellevue, Washington.

01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:03.360
 Can you please ask Dr. Peat to help me understand why high dose PUFA fish oil seems to help

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:09.480
 so many thrive for decades and for decades and going way back from athletes to brain

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:10.480
 injury.

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:16.080
 Fish oil has helped us, helping many perform at high levels, recover from severe brain

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:25.640
 injury, so I don't understand his negative approach to fish oils.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:36.600
 My negative approach, it would take a week or so to give the sources explaining it, but

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:48.840
 the short version is that when you ingest highly polyunsaturated oil, it's like the

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:56.840
 problem with taking in a large amount of synthetic ascorbic acid.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:05.880
 Any reducing and oxidizing catalysts that are present are going to cause an explosive

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:12.960
 degrading oxidation of these highly oxidizable molecules.

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:20.120
 Studies have found that by the time fish oil gets into your bloodstream, it's already highly

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:29.440
 oxidized and it's these oxidized free radical breakdown products of the fish oil that suppress

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:37.000
 the white blood cells and knock down your immune reactions.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:44.680
 So for the first six months, usually, you get these anti-inflammatory effects that seem

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:55.560
 very beneficial, but you've probably heard of the radon baths causing immediate relief

01:18:55.560 --> 01:19:05.240
 from arthritis and they used to give x-ray treatments actually to a sore knee joint and

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:14.320
 you'd get immediate knockdown of the inflammation in an arthritic joint from the ionizing radiation

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:25.280
 but the anti-inflammatory effects of a big dose of highly oxidizable fish oil is working

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:32.040
 by the same mechanism, knocking out the inflammatory white blood cells.

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:42.160
 But the effect six months later, the process starts showing up the harmful effects, the

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:52.680
 radiation damage continues for 20 or 30 or 40 years later and there haven't been such

01:19:52.680 --> 01:20:02.120
 studies with the polyunsaturated oil overdoses but the same kind of damage occurs and so

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:05.520
 you would expect the long-range damage.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:12.480
 What they see is that immune deficiency begins setting in after about six months of continuous

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:18.080
 supplementation of things such as fish oil.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:25.800
 And part of the argument in relation to the brain is that the brain contains a lot of

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:35.040
 these highly polyunsaturated fats but when you look at either humans over a period of

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:43.960
 several decades or in animal studies during a few years of an animal's development, when

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:53.840
 a cow or a person or a dog or rat is newborn, the brain has been highly protected against

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.280
 fatty acid absorption.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:21:03.960
 The brain makes its own polyunsaturated fats as needed from sugar.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:17.880
 The brain first produces saturated fatty acids and then creates an omega-9 glycolic acid

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:31.040
 and then that can be further unsaturated, desaturated to produce the highly unsaturated

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:35.200
 omega-9 series which are used in the brain.

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:41.560
 So those are the only proofs that the newborn brain contains.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:47.880
 They're defined as deficient in essential fatty acids but really that's the state in

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:56.320
 which the brain has its greatest metabolic energy and its greatest capacity to learn.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:04.600
 With aging, the brain gradually accumulates more and more polyunsaturated fats from the

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:13.360
 environment and as it does that, its metabolic rate slows down exactly in proportion with

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.360
 its ability to learn.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.520
 Interesting.

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:24.120
 What's the go-to things that we can do other than stop taking any PUFAs, polyunsaturated

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.960
 fatty acids, to get them out?

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:31.680
 Are there things we can do supplementally or dieterarily to get these guys out?

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:39.600
 Yeah, that's one of the benefits of adjusting your carbohydrate intake very carefully so

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:51.760
 that you get as much as 100% of your energy supply from carbohydrates so that you don't

01:22:51.760 --> 01:23:02.400
 draw down free fatty acids and that allows you to, when you do take in some environmental

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:08.560
 PUFA, you can oxidize that small amount safely.

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:16.600
 So if you keep just your general fat intake as low as possible, maybe 15% if possible

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:26.400
 of your diet as fats, but getting most of the rest of your energy from carbohydrates,

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:35.880
 not too much protein and as little fat as you can manage while still keeping a palatable,

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.600
 pleasant diet.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.100
 But that would be just for somebody who has a PUFA overload.

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:46.560
 If you don't have many PUFAs, you could do more fat and things like that, right?

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.400
 Yeah, a skinny person.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:54.200
 Yeah, like me, I just eat all the butter I can and I don't go anywhere.

01:23:54.200 --> 01:24:01.120
 Yeah, butter is fine if your oxidative system handles it so you don't store it.

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.960
 Yeah, yeah, butter, cheese and all.

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:05.320
 Here's a good one for you.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:12.440
 My husband's basal temperature is quite low, 96.5 and never gets to normal throughout the

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:17.520
 day and his heart rate is 57, he's 68.

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:21.760
 He wants to try one of the thyroid supplements hoping to boost his thyroid.

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:27.800
 Do you think this would work or should we get on something like armor thyroid or something

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:30.600
 like that?

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:39.040
 There are dozens of so-called natural thyroid products on the market, but some of them don't

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:46.280
 work at all and so if you have someone to write a prescription for armor, I think that's

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:51.240
 the best one to start with.

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:57.520
 So 96.5, that would be an indication generally of low thyroid?

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:06.480
 Yeah, that's two degrees Fahrenheit below normal and that's enough to slow all of your

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.600
 biological processes.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:15.560
 We have some people that are listening and watching on YouTube this morning, let's get

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:16.560
 to them.

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:24.660
 Dr. Peat, is it possible that using a near-infrared sauna every night can be counterproductive

01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:33.960
 for joint issues like arthritis or fibrosis and what are your three diet choices for joints?

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.440
 So near-infrared, which is those lamps, right?

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.960
 The heat lamps?

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:46.240
 Yeah, that's just closer to red light is what the near means.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:58.800
 But the body is always emitting infrared radiation near-infrared and far-infrared.

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:11.360
 So we're broadcasting in the range that TV stations and cell phones use.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:19.400
 Some of our, 70% of our biological energy goes out as radiation, much of it in the roughly

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:22.400
 infrared spectrum.

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:31.240
 And if you surround yourself with an insulator and reflector, you quickly overheat because

01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:40.480
 we count on losing two-thirds of our energy into the environment as radiation.

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:53.480
 And the problem with unnatural environmental heat added to the system like a hot bath,

01:26:53.480 --> 01:27:02.800
 if you don't have your orange juice or milk before and during a prolonged hot bath, you

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:12.640
 might faint from consuming your glycogen storage too fast because it does rev up your whole

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:17.240
 metabolic system and you need to feed it at a higher rate.

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:22.800
 So that's the only risk of something like infrared.

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:26.160
 Like saunas, near-infrared, far-infrared.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.280
 So it'd be good for even far-infrared that I like to do to juice up with some orange

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.280
 juice before.

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.560
 Yeah, that's very protective.

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:34.560
 Oh cool.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:39.040
 And the great thing about orange juice, Dr. Pease, is it tastes so good.

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:43.000
 I mean, phew, man, I tell you.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.440
 The body really knows how much it's worth.

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:48.800
 It really knows, right.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:51.360
 You drink it and you go, "Boy, this really tastes good."

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:57.800
 Should the spine, this is from Mjam on YouTube, should the spine ever be experiencing any

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.440
 kind of chronic pain?

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.440
 Should all of this pain be just inflammation?

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:10.880
 Yeah, you should never experience prolonged pain.

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:14.520
 And where there's pain, there's inflammation.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:24.400
 And if it proceeds too long, the inflammation will tend to produce fibrosis or excess collagen

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:30.320
 deposition and eventually atrophy of the good tissues.

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:38.960
 So stopping the pain is really not just symptom relief, but it's actually changing your biology.

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:47.760
 For example, aspirin and the angiotensin receptor blockers are working not just against the

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:57.840
 pain or immediate inflammation and hypertension or whatever, but they're stopping the problem,

01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:05.760
 actually reversing or blocking the proceeding degenerative processes.

01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:10.880
 Here's one from Xtalix, that's about the only name I got there.

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:16.360
 Can you please ask Dr. Pease, what would be the best approach to deal with an eight-year-old

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:20.440
 boy with muscular dystrophy?

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:24.440
 Is it safe to give him progesterone?

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:40.680
 Yeah, too much progesterone in a boy around puberty is able to interfere, prevent the

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:48.720
 testosterone production that will start around the age of nine or 10, the testosterone starts

01:29:48.720 --> 01:30:03.040
 rising slowly, so you don't want to be exaggerated in the use, but it does help to protect an

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:09.040
 atrophy process such as dystrophy of the muscles.

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:16.000
 Do women going through perimenopause in that era tend to need a little testosterone hit?

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:27.920
 No, if they are watching their thyroid and protecting their liver, the main thing is

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:38.880
 to not let estrogen production get out of control because aging, menopause, all of the

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:47.120
 stressful changes tend to activate the process of estrogen inside cells, not in the ovaries,

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:51.320
 but inside every cell of the body.

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:57.800
 Stress turns on the local production of estrogen, which isn't going to get measured in your

01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:05.720
 bloodstream, but if you took out a piece of tissue from a stressed person over the age

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:17.040
 of 55 or so, you're going to find a higher amount of internal estrogen and the aromatase

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:26.400
 enzyme that produces it, and if your cholesterol blood level doesn't increase steadily with

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:35.080
 age, your ability to produce your own progesterone and testosterone is going to be limited in

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:40.800
 proportion to the lack of available cholesterol.

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:43.880
 Here's an interesting one from Carol.

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:50.320
 What could help if I or one of my dogs were bit by a copperhead?

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:55.600
 I killed 11, whoa, last month on my yard, 11, oh my goodness.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.280
 She lives out in the country.

01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:04.520
 Any ideas what could help if she or a dog got bit by one of these guys?

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:12.120
 There have been several studies in which an electrical shocking device applied to the

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:22.120
 bite area will cause some kind of reaction that detoxifies the poison at the site.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:29.400
 Otherwise I don't know what the specific treatment is, but veterinarians would probably have

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:32.280
 an anti-serum to it.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.320
 What about people?

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:39.200
 So is there something she could explore, some kind of shocking device?

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:42.160
 Do you have any other further?

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:48.800
 I don't know the sources that make them, but you can find quite a bit of information on

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:53.640
 the internet about electro shock and snake bite.

01:32:53.640 --> 01:33:00.320
 So just Google electro shock and snake bites maybe.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:09.440
 Well, Dr. Peat, thanks for being here.

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:13.000
 One last thing, oh this is a good one too, I'm glad I caught it.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:18.120
 From JGL, what does Dr., that'll be a good way to close.

01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:23.640
 What does Dr. Peat think, does he think there's any negative effects, negative effects on

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:29.520
 our body from wearing a face mask, even if for just a little while?

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:33.440
 See they get the politically incorrect questions right at the end.

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:34.440
 So what do you think?

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:39.440
 I mean, they're making some people wear these things all day, right, at work.

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:48.040
 Yeah, there are lots of confirmed damages that can happen.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:53.800
 You were talking about exhaling exosomes.

01:33:53.800 --> 01:34:01.240
 Exosomes become concentrated, even if they're your own exosomes, you're going to concentrate

01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:12.480
 them and re-breathe them and any environmental stuff, instead of escaping normally with each

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:20.680
 breath, they're going to, to the extent that the mask does any filtering at all, it's going

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:29.760
 to also concentrate the debris inside the mask so that every breath is a little more

01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:37.200
 concentrated in the stuff that failed to be filtered out by the mask, but you breathe

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:45.560
 it in and then there's a certain filtering effect that keeps it from going away.

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:48.760
 Final final question just popped in, and it's a good one.

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:52.760
 Is Dr. Peat available for phone consultations?

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:53.760
 No.

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:56.760
 You don't do that any longer?

01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:57.760
 No.

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:01.600
 Gave that one up, huh?

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:05.000
 Too many callers, not enough time.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000
 Yeah, yeah.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.040
 Well, Dr. Peat, do you get any painting done these days?

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.040
 Yep.

01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:11.040
 Got a little?

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:16.720
 I got out to stand in the sunlight when it was too hot to lie down in the sun.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:21.440
 I stood up and dabbled on some paintings.

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:22.440
 What kind of things do you do?

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:23.440
 Landscapes?

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.440
 You do landscapes?

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.440
 Yeah.

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:26.440
 You do landscapes.

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.440
 Yeah.

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:30.800
 Well, his website is raypeat.com, right?

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:31.800
 raypeat.com?

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:32.800
 Mm-hmm.

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:35.480
 And we have Ray Peat's newsletter.

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:40.160
 That is plural, Ray Peat's newsletter, gmail.com, if you'd like to join that.

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:41.840
 And it's an honor to have you here.

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:45.040
 Thanks for everything, and we'll see you in about a month or so, sir.

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:46.120
 Okay, very good.

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.120
 Thank you.

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:48.120
 Take care of yourself.

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:49.120
 Okay, bye.

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:50.120
 Dr. Ray Peat's oneradionetwork.com.

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:55.720
 Boy, he's fun, huh?

01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:58.920
 It's amazing that he can remember all this stuff and then connect the dots with, "Whoa,

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.680
 and this and this."

01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:02.280
 It's really cool, Ray Peat.

01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:06.120
 His website, got a lot of good stuff on his website, raypeat.com.

01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:11.040
 Well, we had quite a day, huh?

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:14.160
 Sorry, the internet just got a little wonky there just for a minute.

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:19.880
 I guess about 45 minutes ago, but they fixed it up pretty quick.

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:21.760
 But the whole podcast will be here.

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.000
 I'm not sure how the video is.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.800
 I think it cramped our video style for a moment.

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:30.080
 You know, what are you going to do?

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.840
 We're very blessed with our internet.

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:37.920
 We love you, internet people.

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:38.200
 We love you.

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:46.320
 So, what do we have tomorrow?

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.320
 Let's see.

01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:51.120
 Oh, boy, we got a good show tomorrow.

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.600
 Tom Luongo is going to be here.

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:59.680
 Tom Luongo has got a really interesting whole story about gold.

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:02.680
 Let's see what gold's doing today.

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:03.680
 It's been booming.

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:06.680
 Whoa, whoa, double whoa.

01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.680
 40 bucks.

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:13.680
 It's up $40 today.

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:16.680
 Almost $2,000.

01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:21.680
 Silver's up 3.5%, 27.

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:26.680
 The dollar, I guess, is not happy.

01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:31.680
 So, we're going to talk about it.

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.680
 Gold's on a terror, or so they say, tomorrow.

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:37.680
 And then also Joseph Bender, he's really cool.

01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:42.680
 He's in Austin, and we'll talk about detoxification with Joseph Bender.

01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:45.680
 So, that's our story for tomorrow.

01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:48.680
 I love you all very much.

01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:51.680
 You're doing the best you can, no matter what anybody says.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:53.680
 Drink your orange juice.

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:56.680
 Drink your milk.

01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:00.680
 And I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:01.680
 I love you.

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:03.680
 May the blessings be.
