WEBVTT

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:37.680
 I think there's a lot to physics that has not been properly explored because I call it

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.680
 the Mowgli effect after the discovery of the atom bomb.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.200
 Whatever reigning paradigms of physics were in vogue at that time that were given credit

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.800
 for the discovery of the bomb became enshrined in a kind of untouchable glass like the holy

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.360
 of holies of scientism.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.240
 We kind of sealed it off and said, "Okay, nobody touched the physicists, especially the

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:12.820
 elite because they've discovered a world-changing world-destroying power in their minds and

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.720
 their equations and I think it created a kind of anthropological reverence that the human

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.520
 species almost unduly put into the theoretical physicist's hands.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.840
 It was actually the engineers that really do a lot of these things that the physicists

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.540
 get credit for and I think kind of encasing relativity and quantum into kind of an untouchable

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.400
 paradigm that we can't really, we can't think outside of that.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.400
 I think has slowed down the rate of innovation that physics could help us explore like we

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.160
 were kind of on the trajectory for before we went off in the World War II era, the new

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.780
 order that was established with the bomb.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:13.960
 In many ways I was when the government created big untouchable science.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.080
 It was kind of like the bomb was kind of like the founding moment of the order that

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.080
 we're in now.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.480
 It was like the founding myth.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:37.000
 But I think there have been a pressure in that direction with the logic of math behind

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:47.720
 the quantizing digital approach or the analog approach and I think the reality basically

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:59.560
 sees a causality place, Norbert Wiener sought an analog manner and the government coming

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:12.600
 along with the power to enforce and enforce the digital thinking because it overrides

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:23.120
 the judgment of the individual who's doing the experiment and observing makes it all

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.120
 just mechanical.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.120
 Interesting.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.120
 No criticism possible.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.120
 Yeah, it's interesting.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.760
 Yeah, that reminds me of Marshall McLuhan's, the medium is the message, you know, have

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.080
 you ever looked into his work with the medium?

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.040
 Do you think he was on the money with what he was talking about?

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.400
 I mean, he obviously didn't see where we're at today, but we are in a completely, you

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400
 know.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:57.720
 Yeah, sometimes he got a little formalistic and idealistic and essentially abstracting

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.320
 it too much, but his heart was in the right place.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.320
 Right.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.880
 Yeah, so you think that we've got too much digital thinking from government and not enough

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.880
 analog.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.360
 Is that which?

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:18.760
 Yeah, essentially, Andy is too much when it's under the control of government.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.840
 Norbert Wiener's fate at MIT was very representative.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:35.440
 He rejected money from the military for his research, but there is absolutely nothing

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:45.360
 wrong with his analog form of cybernetics and causality.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:56.640
 But the Pentagon went against obedience and digitalizing use of computers, and so they

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:07.680
 pushed Nolan Chomsky to the foreground and just totally obscured Wiener's approach.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.680
 Interesting.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.760
 Yeah, it's interesting how there's a lot of sketchy origins for a lot of the big digital

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.200
 platforms like Google and stuff, having a kind of relationship to some of the intelligence

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.000
 groups of our government, you know.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.560
 Oh, total creations of them.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.560
 Yeah.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.720
 Nothing creative, just imposed doctrine.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.240
 Chomsky's so-called linguistics was absolutely unworkable.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:46.360
 It simply destroyed what was known about linguistics and was utterly fraudulent, but just by arrogance

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:54.520
 and Pentagon money, he changed the way universities teach language and linguistics.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.160
 In a way that doesn't work at all.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.440
 How did that shape the world we're in today, you know, that move?

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:15.880
 In 1968, I did a student initiated a course at the University of Oregon, in which we

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:27.920
 asked a well-known professor from each of 10 departments to present one-week lecture

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:40.640
 on what was the most important contribution of his department to understanding the nature

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.120
 of man.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:58.560
 There were people from linguistics, anthropology, literature, sociology, philosophy, 10, 10

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:08.960
 separate disciplines, and after about the third lecture a student came up and said, "This

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.140
 is a joke, isn't it?"

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:19.440
 Because everyone was saying Chomskyism was their department's best contribution to understanding

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.080
 the nature of humanity.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:36.820
 It turned up every one of the 10 that viewed already in 1968 and already in 1960 or '62

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:44.040
 when I was working on it, obviously there was a fraud.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.740
 A deliberate fraud?

00:07:46.740 --> 00:08:08.060
 One of his students, one of his spaces was these rules generate language, and they pointed

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:16.380
 out that nothing is generated; you can't know which rule to apply until you know what

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:26.800
 to form in the language as you want to explain, and he said, "Well, of course, to generate

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:35.560
 is use in the mathematical sense of to account for," but it was in his public statements

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:47.500
 saying to generate describes of creative mechanism in the brain genetically installed

00:08:47.500 --> 00:09:02.300
 set of rules, and that these rules are explaining the creative generation of previously unproduced

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:11.420
 language, but one of his flight students got him to say, "Well, no, if it just means

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:20.600
 to generate in the sense of account for," right, yeah, it's interesting because Chomsky

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.940
 has presented as an anti-establishment figure for the left, but he's really kind of a court

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:33.180
 jester in your opinion, huh, and so- Oh, yeah, it's the most recent thing about that people

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:44.980
 who refuse to be vaccinated should be socially isolated, and someone said, "Well, who would

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:52.420
 take care of them, basically, how would they survive if they were isolated other than you

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.220
 said that's their concern?"

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.220
 Wow.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.220
 Interesting.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:06.300
 Yeah, what do you think of some of these other figures that have become kind of Godfathers

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.740
 of where we are now in our culture?

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:17.380
 I'm thinking about folks like Herbert Marcuse, he worked with the OSS, and he ended up becoming

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:24.700
 a big figure, in my opinion, for the development of what we think of with these influence of

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:30.260
 the Frankfurt School in the development of what they popularly call social justice movements

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:37.980
 today, is that, by design as well, by these powerful forces to create these critical theories?

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:52.100
 I think so, getting away from the basic idea of a class and on this humanitarian judgment

00:10:52.100 --> 00:11:06.740
 that there was no conflict between the formal Marxism and the communitarian Christian ideals

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:23.860
 of social morality, but under the influence of the government, the secret services, the

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:37.340
 marginalized ideas of politics were used very deliberately to distract attention from the

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:42.940
 basic things of class, power, and justice.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:43.940
 Right.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:51.460
 Yeah, so you would say, would you lump some of the French post-modernists that came over

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:58.980
 the big wave that hit academia in America, the 1960s and '70s, and all that, was--

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:04.340
 Oh, the CIA was big in that.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.180
 Why?

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:21.340
 It was abstracting, it was confusing, distracting from the continual practical approach to politics

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:29.980
 and deconstructionism and a lot of it just became mystical garbage.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:30.980
 Yeah.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:35.300
 Yeah, that's a good way of putting it, mystical garbage.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.620
 Are you familiar with the work of Slavoj Jiejek?

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.980
 I'd say it's again.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:40.980
 Slavoj Jiejek?

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:55.020
 Oh, yeah, he was sort of a maniacal talker, a very fun to listen to, but it doesn't seem

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.340
 to have much traction getting it deeper.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.340
 Right.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:06.180
 So, you think the whole post-modern project in terms of its intellectual effect on America

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:15.020
 has been something the CIA and other forces have put into our politics to scramble the

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.900
 powerless and confuse them?

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.420
 I think so.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.020
 And what is their purpose of doing that is, you know, the anti-establishment right would

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:30.140
 say, "Oh, that's because they were planning a communist takeover of America that they,

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:36.180
 you know, there's a long march through the institutions, and so this is all part of that

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.180
 process."

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:51.500
 I think it was just to insert their weakening slant on things.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:14:03.540
 I can't think of his first name, but a former professor in Ethiopia and an author of a very

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:12.300
 interesting libertarian, you can find his articles on, I think that my brain is getting

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.500
 tired of the libertarian.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.500
 Lou Rockwell?

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.500
 Yeah, exactly.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.500
 Lou Rockwell.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.500
 Yeah.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.500
 And Cummings, is his name?

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.500
 Iver.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.500
 Iver Cummings?

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.500
 Yeah.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.500
 No.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.500
 No.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.500
 Iver.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.500
 No.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:47.260
 But he showed how the CIA took over the anti-apartheid movement.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:15:00.820
 He inserted sexual politics, and everything except simple justice thinking, and Cummings

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:13.200
 has a very detailed analysis and history of the South African role of the CIA and how

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.480
 it interacted with the New Left politics in the U.S.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:24.240
 Yeah, I think it's interesting, you know, how America, you mentioned Ethiopia, and I interviewed

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:30.960
 Prince Ermias Salasi, the grandson of Emperor Holly Salasi, and the story of how Emperor

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:38.980
 Salasi was basically set out to die by the American establishment in Ethiopia, you know,

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:46.600
 in this, you know, this Soviet-backed uprising, but it's really, if you actually look at it,

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:54.320
 a lot of the intellectuals that were stirring up the Ethiopian, you know, revolt and ultimate

00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:00.520
 killing of Emperor Salasi were people who came from America, you know, intellectual new

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:06.780
 left thinkers that were coming over and radicalizing the population, and of course, Emperor Salasi

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:13.480
 had his flaws, but he certainly did a lot to try to, you know, push back against colonialism

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:21.320
 in Africa, and he's, you know, becomes a victim of America's foreign policy as well.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:27.200
 So what is that, you know, I guess, what is the animating force behind these institutions?

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:35.680
 Is it, do they have a, do they have a, you know, a motivating vision of the world, that

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:41.300
 kind of religious imposition that they want to remake the world in a certain way?

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.900
 Are they ideologically motivated?

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.900
 The people who were-

00:16:43.900 --> 00:17:01.580
 Oh, you have things like white racism and Darwinism and the, through the eugenics tradition, imperialism

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:13.060
 and the whole profession of anthropology was motivated by this, a very strong trend of

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.940
 English racism.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.260
 And that's what's moving the CIA's actions through the recent history in America, you

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.260
 would say?

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:34.980
 Yeah, you know, major strain of the ruling class through the end of the 19th century,

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:46.880
 for most of the 20th century, was dedicated to genocide through eugenics.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:18:00.860
 And it was only in 1945 when Hitler became a scapegoat for just about everything that

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:10.160
 American genetics people had to take the word eugenics out of their lexical.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:23.060
 The American Journal of Genetics changed its name suddenly in 1945 to the human genetics,

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:33.240
 but exactly the same racist, white supremacist ideas were permeating the whole so-called

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:47.880
 science of genetics and the anthropology that was applied policy of the ruling class largely

00:18:47.880 --> 00:19:03.960
 recruited from places like Yale in this CIA, blurring essentially the nature and the evils

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.200
 of the assumptions behind genetics.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.200
 Right.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.360
 But you say that they are motivated by white supremacy, but that's the number one thing

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:19.120
 they call everything today, Joe Biden said his number one enemy is white supremacy and

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.000
 you hear about the critical theorists talking about institutional white supremacy and they're

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.520
 rooting it out with these organizations, Black Lives Matter and all these different things.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:41.780
 Yeah, it's a very fraudulent kind of justice movement, but that doesn't really do anything.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.480
 So why is it just a classic projection?

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:49.820
 You project to your victims what you're doing, what you believe and what you want.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:20:02.660
 Yeah, basically the same way that the journals had to drop the word eugenics, the whole culture

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:14.560
 realizes that it isn't popular to talk white supremacy as a supremism, but that's still

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.880
 their basic policy to create it.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:26.240
 Now, do you believe that this is like people feel like this great reset is a part of this

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:34.860
 kind of controlled demolition of the American economy in a shift towards a new kind of globally

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.860
 managed?

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:47.300
 Yeah, it's actually that these all of these threads became very open with the World Economic

00:20:47.300 --> 00:21:02.200
 Forum, Rockefeller Institute and several other foundations have been segmented very openly

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:11.240
 that the population reduction and destruction of the existing economy have to go together

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:23.200
 and Klaus Fab just openly said that the COVID epidemic came along just in time because the

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.000
 climate change wasn't working fast enough.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:36.280
 So now we've got something down that can significantly move towards destroying the economy

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.560
 in just two or three years.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:44.960
 Yeah, we're seeing constant supply chain disruptions and baby formula shortages.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.720
 Of course, those baby formulas are filled with toxic poofers, as you would say.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:22:03.600
 Yeah, and the Ukraine war is not just part of the way to destroy the economy and get 100

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:13.880
 to come on massively within a matter of a few weeks, we're right on the edge now of

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:22.600
 the southern hemisphere hunger epidemics because of the war or because of the sanctions

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:36.880
 for the war, but they totally whitewashed the origins of the war, the west reasons for

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:49.200
 supporting the, you know, Victorian New London for, might then revolution, that, what was

00:22:49.200 --> 00:23:03.160
 to impose a change of constitutional law on the Ukraine because they had passed laws to

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:20.080
 protect the smaller medium-sized farmers who wanted to produce the traditional crops not

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:33.120
 genetically modified and the west wanted to destroy those laws to rewrite the constitution.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:47.760
 So that Monsanto could write the laws and require the privatization of all of the productive

00:23:47.760 --> 00:24:02.040
 land so that Monsanto could provide their round of and resistant seed for essentially

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:16.440
 Monsanto's sake and the crude people have been steadily working on that to knock out

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:27.880
 the protective laws put in the Monsanto laws and that, but at the same time this was happening

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:44.520
 the Europe had put out instructions to boycott Americans genetically modified grains and

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:56.960
 the policy of Monsanto, so there is a conflict between U.S., G&O policy and European G&O

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:11.460
 policy fighting it out within this coup change in the Ukraine and Russia had been even more

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:26.700
 consistent in avoiding Monsanto's laws and G&O then Europe even, so if you see direction

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:41.980
 policy favored by losing the battle of Europe against American GMO production that puts

00:25:41.980 --> 00:26:01.680
 the U.S. against the Russian and the Kennedy European boycott of G&O.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:06.160
 You think that's the main driving issue is the GMO thing in Ukraine?

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:20.660
 Well, it was at the major thing for the coup in 2014 and gradually back and forth putting

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.980
 in Monsanto's laws.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:34.020
 How do you rank that issue compared to the IMF loan issue and all that, about the U.K.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:39.020
 Ukrainian government making a decision to be more closely connected to Russia's oligarchs

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:45.560
 versus the EU's oligarchs financially and the debt obligations they would have to pay

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.220
 to the IMF?

00:26:48.220 --> 00:27:01.200
 Well, the IMF and World Bank are the major forces in enforcing Monsanto's privatization

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:20.740
 of the wheat and the oligarchs tend to go with the privatization of direction policy as

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:25.500
 a self-consistent against GMO.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:30.740
 Now, another thing that they've been pushing lately in the media that you never saw before

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:35.660
 or like this, well, I guess it's been a long time since the mainstream media talked about

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.300
 it, is the UFO thing.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:44.720
 I mean, remember the media used to talk about the UFOs flying over the White House?

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.720
 When was that?

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.040
 It was the 1950s?

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.940
 Was that when Eisenhower was president?

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:56.740
 And then all of a sudden it goes off and they do this announcement that there's nothing

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:02.140
 here and then, you know, and so it's become kind of a tabloid subject.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:06.740
 And now all of a sudden, you know, CBS at 60 minutes and they've done a congressional

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:12.860
 hearing now just a couple of weeks ago that they're revisiting this UFO thing and they're

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:20.980
 saying it's these objects that are tic-tac in shape and they move way beyond hypersonic

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:27.940
 speed, they can go in the water and go back up into the space and like almost instantly.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:35.680
 I've actually interviewed some of the naval people who have reported these events themselves.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.980
 They seem to be credible and genuine in their reports of what they saw.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.020
 But I wonder what this all is.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:46.980
 Is this a government hoax?

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:51.780
 Is this just a bunch of eyewitnesses all getting it collectively wrong?

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.860
 I mean, we look back into the records of American history.

00:28:55.860 --> 00:29:03.700
 We see in earlier decades in the 50s, naval pilots reporting flying lozenges.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.700
 They didn't have the word for tic-tac established as well as we call them now, these tic-tac

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.260
 objects, you know?

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.180
 So they've been seeing these objects for a long time.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:15.220
 So if that was some kind of secret technology from China or Russia, that would be hard to

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.420
 believe they had that back then.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.660
 What do you think is this story?

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:23.540
 Is this a hoax from the government or what?

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:34.580
 I've had my own few experiences like when I was in the 7th grade.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:43.980
 My mother, now that night, hanging laundry, and she said she just saw something very strange.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:54.220
 There were 9 green, luminous objects, it was about 9.30 at night.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:30:03.940
 And they were silently moving across the sky towards the north, and the next morning in

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:14.300
 the paper, in Portland, about 5 minutes or 10 minutes later than that, the same reports

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.180
 came out.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:26.700
 And so they were traveling at something around the south some miles an hour in the group,

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:45.500
 and no more was made of those sightings, except that looking, following the trajectory,

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:54.940
 there had been a little earlier in the southwest area.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:31:07.180
 If on the same trajectory, again, the same 9 luminous green triangles.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.140
 So what do you make of that?

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:15.460
 I mean, I was wondering if that's something that the government's pushing to try to scare

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:21.380
 us to the new hysteria, but you're saying it might be something real, or how could they

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.940
 have that kind of technology so long?

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:43.260
 Yeah, that was very fast for the, around 1915, and in the 1970s, I think it was, I was viving

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:54.860
 out this way, south side of the city, and that there had been a very short sort of chain

00:31:54.860 --> 00:32:07.780
 with one of those, like a gas station's very tall album tower, sort of a plastic bubble

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:20.420
 of sighted to help in closing four fluorescent tubes, so the sign was luminous, to some extent

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:31.260
 during the day, but I was viving along outside of my eye, I saw what looked like one of these

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:41.180
 luminous plastic pods, about for the tower, would have it, but it was in the daylight,

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:50.820
 and I'm very, just like a brightly illuminated, white or silvery pod, roughly the shape of

00:32:50.820 --> 00:33:02.920
 one of those signs, as you look like people, and I watched it, assuming that it was an

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:11.660
 actual, it would have been the sign, seeming to move, as the car moved along, but suddenly

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:27.100
 I saw there was no stem attaching it, and instead of rising as a approach, it started

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:38.460
 lifting towards the horizon, and slipped down behind the hills, so at the positions of the

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:49.040
 hills it would have been about 200 feet tall or something, and in orbit it was bigger,

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:59.520
 and it looked in the papers for anything about it, and some very different areas, Northern

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:12.600
 California, I think, was said that there had been some experiments that basically unexplained

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:22.000
 what they were doing, but the government said they had done something, but it was a very

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:31.440
 spectacular, huge luminescence in the daylight, is it your personal opinion that these things

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:38.120
 could be government technology that they've had for a long time, you don't believe it's

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:47.060
 extraterrestrials or something like that, I consider it a possibility, but so far I

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:57.960
 think it's more likely that some of them are maybe natural phenomena, others are government

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:03.520
 saying these are covered up, and what do you think the government is coming out publicly

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.520
 in their favorite state media outlets, like CBS, to talk about these things has real

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:13.320
 phenomena now, what's in their interest to do that?

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.880
 I don't know.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.040
 Yeah, it's interesting.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:25.840
 I really appreciate your time, I don't want to take up much more of it, I guess I wanted

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:32.960
 to get a baseline of your thoughts about where we are today in current events, do you have

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:40.400
 any kind of prognostications, are you hopeful about the future in the long term, or do you

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:46.360
 think things are going to steadily go downhill for a long period of time in America at least,

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:50.040
 or do you believe it's very open, the choices?

00:35:50.040 --> 00:36:02.840
 It has been made open by the conspirators themselves, these last ten years or so, and

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:09.120
 I think the fact that the public is now, just that the Prince is starting to talk about

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:22.680
 and recognize that just because it seems impossibly huge as a conspiracy, that they're really

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:36.480
 considering that the conspiracy could be that evil and that's huge, I think that's a potential

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.160
 dilemma of hope.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.760
 And do you believe the ultimate goal of the great reset is kind of a malthusian reduction

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.600
 in the population and consolidation of markets under cartel control?

00:36:48.600 --> 00:37:00.440
 Oh yeah, the faster reduction of population, the better, and the destruction of the mere

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:09.520
 economy that has supported billions of people, they don't need that.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.760
 They want a lot more space for themselves and their friends.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:22.880
 Yeah, and a better ratio of power and force.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.320
 Do you think that's what's behind the metaverse, the Facebook creation of these people, virtual

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:31.880
 reality, where you're going to supposedly want to stay on this virtual reality world

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.880
 24/7.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880
 Oh yeah.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:46.520
 Have you read any of Eric Smith's papers or talks since he was openly working for the

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.520
 Pentagon?

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.680
 Oh, the Google guy?

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.680
 Yeah.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.680
 What's he doing now?

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.680
 What's he talking?

00:37:52.680 --> 00:38:00.880
 After a Google or before Google?

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:08.760
 In 2019, he emerged from the Pentagon as the head of an agency of artificial intelligence

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:19.000
 and was actually saying these things that we have to destroy the existing economy so

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:26.240
 that we can more quickly have total control through artificial intelligence.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:31.720
 A lot of people believe that we're already basically controlled by artificial intelligence

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:38.800
 because of how much these algorithms control the population's moods and hysteria's and

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:45.160
 manias through algorithmic manipulation in Google and Facebook and Twitter setting the

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.220
 tone for what people think and feel.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.220
 Yeah.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.220
 And the election control.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.220
 Right.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:55.000
 So is there any way to, what's your, I mean, do you have any prescriptions about how to

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.400
 break free from this stuff?

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:04.160
 Is it just freedom or education, enlightenment, innovation, you know?

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:09.800
 Encouraging everyone to investigate and talk about it.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.800
 Right.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:18.080
 So do you land on a kind of a political conclusion of libertarianism or anarcho something?

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:25.920
 And there's all kinds of anarcho groups that you see out there, you know?

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:39.800
 One important thing is to stop being divided and conquered and stop worrying about competitors

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:49.680
 and realize that essentially it's everyone against, you know, flop and gates.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.680
 Wow.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:56.560
 And how do you think is the best way to beat them at their power game because they want

00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.560
 people to react violently because that's how they were able to create more power.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.600
 Look at what they've done with the January 6 riot.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:09.520
 They've milked that as a religion for them as a kind of remembrance of their sacred temple

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:16.520
 being, you know, sullied by the unwashed masses from flyover country that weren't supposed

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:24.600
 to be anywhere near that temple, you know?

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:37.280
 Everyone has to start recognizing that we're all deplorables and stop squabbling among ourselves

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:45.600
 and focus on the very, very few people who were actually doing it.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:52.600
 Do you believe that the action that positive change can happen through the electoral process

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:58.840
 or does it happen by creating a counter, like an alternative economy, an alternative food

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:05.240
 system that, like, is it action in that way of organizing a society outside of their grid?

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.240
 Yeah.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.240
 Yeah.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.960
 I think we have to have direct reorganization.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.960
 Interesting.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.960
 Yeah.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:17.200
 Well, I really appreciate your -- what's that?

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:30.000
 The Google controls everything through the algorithms, I think makes the election change

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 meaningless.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 Yeah.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.640
 What do you think about Bitcoin as a solution or these cryptocurrencies?

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:49.560
 I don't think there's anything there if anything that's probably a creation of the NSA or who's

00:41:49.560 --> 00:42:02.120
 ultimately in control of the Internet, and I don't think there's such a thing as real

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.120
 secrecy.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.120
 Right.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:11.560
 Do you believe -- are you a fan of gold and silver as a real money, a hard asset that

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:12.560
 actually --

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.560
 Yeah.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:28.560
 In practical amounts, I'm extra of it because silver is too heavy to carry around a large

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.480
 amount of wealth.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:42.840
 And gold is so hard to negotiate without the government recognizing it.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.840
 Right.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:44.840
 Yeah.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:51.440
 I think what you're saying is accurate that we need to get out of the false dialectic

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.560
 and kind of embrace -- it's just so hard.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.760
 You know, they put so many triggering things that divide people.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:04.480
 The newest thing that has been inflammatory is trying to normalize children to embrace

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:11.760
 gender reassignment surgery, you know, and hormone blockers at five years old and six.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:18.360
 They're taking toddlers into drag queen bars where there's a lot of, you know, very sexualized

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.400
 content and stuff.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:26.280
 That kind of stuff makes it very difficult for, you know, your average rather conservative

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.960
 family to get along with the, you know, the leftists that are kind of buying into these

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.400
 cultural identity markers.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.640
 How do you overcome that?

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:49.400
 Start fixing the so-called "left" that recognizes it's a deliberate ploy of the institutions,

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.640
 the government at foundations.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.840
 Interesting.

00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:04.480
 Is there a good left you like or, like, where do you point people to read or learn from

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.480
 philosophers or --

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.480
 Oh, okay.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:16.200
 You have to look back at the under -- or so years of whole-hearted terms mean and why

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:22.400
 they have glossed to their meanings so totally.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.760
 What do you make of this new right that's emerging on the right, you know?

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:30.920
 Is that another controlled opposition or is there something there?

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:43.200
 Most of it, I think, is manipulated for our dealings, mistleting the public.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:52.560
 Yeah, it's hard to navigate and have discernment to know where do you get your best accurate

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:56.520
 information from?

00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:06.280
 The trend thing was very powerful at confusing people on what is left and what is right.

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:12.680
 And that regard, it was a good thing because it scrambled people's normal patterns, right?

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.680
 Yeah.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:19.680
 Yeah, it's interesting to see, you know, I think we're living through what could be a

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.240
 very, very difficult and dangerous time for America.

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:30.320
 I think that the folks who run these globalist institutions are treating America like a fire

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.320
 cell.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:36.560
 When your stores closing, everything's half off, it's a vultures are coming and starting

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.560
 to pick apart.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:42.320
 And it's happened for a long time now, but you can really start to see a lot of the

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:50.880
 machine in the, you know, veneer of comfort and wealth in America really start to fray

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.880
 right now.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:58.080
 And I think it's a very apocalyptic moment, so to speak, in the true sense of the word

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:02.360
 of unveiling that which was hidden, you know?

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:06.680
 Are you familiar with the work of René Girard, the anthropologist that taught at Stanford?

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.680
 No.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:13.600
 Yeah, he was an anthropologist that I think you would like his work.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:20.960
 He believed that all culture and language was all mediated on hidden victims, this sacrificial

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:27.600
 mechanism, what he called the scapegoat mechanism that societies are constantly on the hunt

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:34.560
 to, you know, devour escape, go to maintain the sense of differentiation and order.

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:40.080
 And that's kind of the heart and soul of the social contract and everything we consider

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:48.440
 to be modern is really a vestige of the sacred, you know, sacrificial ritual.

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.800
 So I think that's kind of where we're at right now.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.280
 This whole process is falling apart and they're trying to hunt for scapegoats and it's not

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.240
 working, you know?

00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.240
 Yeah.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:03.400
 Well, Dr. Peat, I appreciate your time and how can people stay in touch to read your

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.400
 work.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.820
 I always like to let you share with people where they can contact you.

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:16.120
 Oh, my website is always there, repeat it at thebreakeat.com.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.120
 We're very good.

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.120
 Thanks again, sir.

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:19.120
 Okay.

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:20.120
 Thank you.

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.120
 All right.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:40.760
 Bye.
