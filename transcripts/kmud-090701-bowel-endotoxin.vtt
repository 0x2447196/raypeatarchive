00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 My name's Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 which run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8pm,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 or which are sourced from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 to this month's topic of bowel endotoxin.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 So, the number here if you live in the area is 923 3911

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 or if you live outside the area, the toll free number is 1800 KMUD RAD

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 and we can also be reached toll free on 1 888 WBM HERB

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 for further questions during normal business hours Monday through Friday.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 So, this month we're again very pleased and fortunate to welcome Dr. Ray Peat back to this show

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 and we'll be exploring the emerging revelation concerning endotoxemia

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 and how unsaturated fats further burden our bodies in ways we could never imagine.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 So, welcome to tonight's show Dr. Peat.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Thanks.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Okay, perhaps for those people that are tuning in this evening,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 if you could outline what is endotoxin, how is it formed and how is it harmful to our health?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 I'm not sure that people really know what it's doing in the bacterium

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 but it's been known since 1892, it was called endotoxin to distinguish it

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 from the older known bacterial toxins that the bacteria in effect secrete to poison something in their environment

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 and supposedly the endotoxin only comes out when the bacterium is broken apart

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 but I think actually it leaks a little bit all the time.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 So, I wouldn't say that it's strictly an endotoxin like the textbooks used to say

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 but it's somewhat of a structural protein but it's a medium to smallish molecule

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 that can leak out in the process of growth and cell division and so on

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 and its other name is lipopolysaccharide because its structure is a chain of sugar molecules with fatty acids attached

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 and that gives it kind of a soap-like behavior that is part of why it's toxic so generally

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 and they are so common in the environment that organisms have their basic defenses against them.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 One of our basic defenses is the high-density lipoprotein

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 and they talk about it in terms of carrying cholesterol but I think really its historic main function

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 is that it's our first defense against endotoxin once the endotoxin gets into the bloodstream

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 but normally the intestine is a good barrier against absorbing the endotoxins

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 and if some of it leaks through the wall of the intestine into the blood vessels

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 and gets carried to the liver, the liver enzymes break it down

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 and so it shouldn't normally reach the bloodstream in significant amounts

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 but it's a matter of tens of milligrams that can circulate into the bloodstream every day.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Do you know, as an aside, do you know if there is a value, a picogram or whatever value

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 associated to a "acceptable level"?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Yeah, it stimulates defense reactions and so it's kind of like a toughening up reaction

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 to have a small amount of it.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 If you're born in a germ-free environment, your first exposure to bacteria is likely to be lethal

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 but absorbing a little bit of the endotoxin toughens up the system.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Okay, this would be, and again this is an aside, it's not something I was planning on going through with you

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 but perhaps this harkens back to the, as you said, the kind of germ, yeah I'll say germ-ridden

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 but the germ prevalent society maybe of a hundred years ago producing children that had better immune systems

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 and did not have autism or any of the other syndromes maybe associated with the sterile environments of today.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Yeah, I think the ups and downs when you try to be too sterile and then are exposed inevitably to germs

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 the sudden shock is probably a lot more stressful.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Right, okay, well getting back to endotoxins then and you mentioned lipopolysaccharide

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 and some people will have heard of LPS or lipopolysaccharide.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 How is it harmful to our health if the bacteria, if I'm right in thinking that these bacteria

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 are the main source of this endotoxin and we are exposed to varying amounts of it daily,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 how is it harmful to our health?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 It triggers a whole series of reactions and it seems to be a physical chemical process

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 that sort of stirs up a cell to recognise a threat and set off a chain of reactions

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 and it's the things that it sets into action that really cause the chronic accumulating damage,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 degenerative damage.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 It's one of the first things that does on exciting a cell is to cause the cell to take up calcium

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 and to activate the synthesis of nitric oxide and the nitric oxide and the cell excitation

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 that goes with absorbing calcium trigger other reactions and a small amount of endotoxin

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 can stimulate the intestine to contract more but if the cells are getting overloaded with it

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 that and possibly other irritants can cause cells to produce so much nitric oxide

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 that the nitric oxide becomes a major metabolic disruptor

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 and will cause the intestine to lose the ability to contract

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 and it will poison the respiratory apparatus so that cells can't make energy to fight back

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 and at that point with increased nitric oxide and reduced energy and taking up calcium

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 the cells also take up water.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 And then they become basically non-functioning to a degree.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 Yeah, they're under stress and if the body can deliver enough energy to them quickly

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 they can excrete the water and the calcium and turn off the nitric oxide

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 and return to normal functioning but when they swell up

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 another place that the textbooks give a very simplified mistaken idea of what is involved in

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 bowel damage from endotoxin, they talk about the leakage between cells

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 as if the cells lose the glue that holds them in contact with each other

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 so holes open up between cells.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 That does happen but it isn't necessarily the worst way that the endotoxin gets into the cells

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 and passes through the cells.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 The whole structure of the cell, the cytoplasm, as it takes up water

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 instead of being fat-like and tending to exclude water and prefer to absorb fats

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 the introduction of this sugar connected to a fat acts like a soap

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 and makes the cell tend to admit not only more water but pretty much anything that is in its environment

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 so the whole substance of the cell becomes kind of spongy and leaky.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 When this starts affecting the whole organism that kind of change occurs all through the body

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 once the stuff has passed through the lining of the intestine and crosses across capillaries

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 and gets into the bloodstream then the endotoxin starts doing the same thing

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 to any cell it comes to and so it will leak out of capillaries

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 no matter where it is in the bloodstream if the liver hasn't filtered it.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 So if it happens to reach the brain it will cause the brain capillaries to leak

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 whatever is in the bloodstream so it can contribute to multiple sclerosis

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 and the endotoxin leaking into the brain does the same thing

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 it triggers the release of nitric oxide and a whole chain of chemical reactions

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 that every organ has its particular way of responding to the endotoxin

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 but there's a generality no matter what the organ

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 there are basic defense reactions that will occur not only to endotoxin

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 but to any radical threat to the survival of the cell

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 so that x-rays and gamma rays will produce essentially the same kind of change

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 in brain cells or bowel cells that endotoxin does

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 and so if you're overexposed to x-rays for example you'll get constipated

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 the same way that overexposure to endotoxin will cause constipation.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 Okay so there's a kind of saponification going on then?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Yeah and opening up, loosening up of the cell structure

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 so it becomes instead of like if you imagine a lump of gelatin dipped, soaked in oil

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 it'll stay stable in the presence of water

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 but if you mix a little bit of lecithin with it, it'll quickly start taking up water

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 and then the whole thing is on the road to dissolving and breaking up.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 Okay, well perhaps this would lead me on to my next question for you

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 which was that many of our listeners perhaps have heard the term "leaky gut"

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 or "leaky gut syndrome"

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 can you outline again, perhaps you've already done that in part

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 but can you outline what causes a leaky gut then

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 and how a leaky bowel wall may lead to this translocation of bacteria

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 and/or endotoxin into the bloodstream?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 Yeah, endotoxin is always present in the intestine

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 and it's always the first thing to defend against

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 but many other stresses and toxins like radiation

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 or heavy metals or estrogenic substances

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 or too many polyunsaturated fatty acids and so on

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 all of these things tend to loosen up or saponify the cell structure

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 and cause the cell to take up water and let junk enter from the environment

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 into the cell substance itself

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 and getting into the cell substance then it can just as easily go out the other side of the cell

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 into the underlying extracellular material

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 and from there across the capillary cells and into the bloodstream

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 and that is essentially what the leaky gut is

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 it's leaky cell substance which involves leaky capillaries

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 and ultimately it can cause leakiness of any tissue

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 in the precancerous states

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 for example you see substance leaking out of the characteristic cell

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 and those indicate a tendency to develop cancer in that organ

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 because that organ is most stressed and is leaking its substance

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 for example the prostate specific antigen is just a normal prostate protein

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 that leaks out because the cell is under stress

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 and the same protein leaks out of breast cells when they're under stress

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 and characteristic proteins leak out of any cell when it's under stress

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 so it literally is the cell is falling apart

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 it's breaking down, it's leaking

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 and something as simple as vitamin E

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 can tremendously strengthen the cell and help to hold it together

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 so it doesn't leak its protein substance out into the environment

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 and what would be the mechanism behind that?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 oh no one really knows but partly it's stopping the free radical damage

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 that nitric oxide is producing

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 and it helps to keep calcium from overloading the cell

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 and keeps the water from associating too closely with the proteins

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 and a lot of protective substances will do that

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 the natural hormones progesterone and testosterone

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 help to toughen up the cell and keep it from leaking

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 the factors similar to vitamin E that are associated with energy production

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 coenzyme Q10 and vitamin K

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 are closely associated with vitamin E and energy production

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 and they are extremely powerful at defending the respiratory apparatus

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 from nitric oxide and endotoxin

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 when you mentioned a few moments ago

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 when you were talking about the influx of water into the cell

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 and the cell not having sufficient energy

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 would thyroid be a part to play in raising the energy of the cell?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 yeah the thyroid is essential for making the enzyme

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 that essentially allows oxygen to absorb electrons out of the mitochondrial system

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 the mitochondria takes up electrons from sugars and fats

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 and it drives energy from those electrons as they are passed along to oxygen

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 and thyroid is the essential factor for making that happen

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 and there are other supporting factors

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 a system called the uncoupling proteins

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 that simply make the electrons run more quickly to be taken up by oxygen

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 and what that does is produce carbon dioxide more quickly

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 which turns off the formation of lactic acid

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 and that turns off basically the nitric oxide forming system

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 so if you can run the system fast enough with plenty of thyroid

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 then you'll make the carbon dioxide and inhibit lactic acid formation

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 and pretty well defend against producing nitric oxide

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 and that gives you relative immunity to the lipopolysaccharide

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 ok, is that what they call the electron transport chain?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 yeah

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 the NADH and that other cycle

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 yeah, the electrons pass from that down to oxygen

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 but they can't do it without thyroid

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 and the temperature is one of the factors

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 when you run the electrons through the system

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 you produce heat as well as carbon dioxide and ATP

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 and keeping the temperature up is one of the things

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 that helps to turn off the production of nitric oxide

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 and other free radical destructive factors

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 so all of these harmful x-rays, LPS from the bacteria in our intestines

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 excess of estrogen that our own bodies can just be producing

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 not necessarily from what we're taking as HRT

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 or other forms of oral contraceptive pills

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 but all of these things are essentially free radicals

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 that are damaging our oxygen usage

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 is that correct Dr. Peat?

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 yeah, and not all free radicals are toxic

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 but nitric oxide, the one that is so widely produced

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 in response to stress

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 it increases greatly with aging too

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 just because aging involves the progressive stress reactions

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 I remember the, I think they were called poppers

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 weren't these chemicals or drugs of some kind

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 that were nitric oxide based and were becoming

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 and they were very damaging and that's probably why

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 just explain the...

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 yeah, nitroglycerin has been used as a drug

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 to open the circulation to the heart

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 and nitric oxide didn't really get much interest

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 scientifically until Viagra came along

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 and that's basically doing the same thing as nitroglycerin

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 but it's extremely toxic

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 it's just like eating toxins and getting irradiated

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 and getting old ahead of time

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 wow, quite a price to pay

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 so it's just a very potent, powerful free radical

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 that people don't really realize the damage that they're creating

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 by depleting their bodies of oxygen

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 yeah, and some free radicals can actually defend

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 against the toxic free radicals

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 when the thyroid and oxygen are working properly

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 the electron transport chain involves lots of free radical activity

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 but it is all productive and protective

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 the faster you run oxygen through the mitochondrion

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 under the influence of thyroid

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 the less free radical damage you have

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 to the structure of the cell and the mitochondrion

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 ok, alright, well...

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 if you are low thyroid or somehow lack oxygen acutely

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 the electrons, instead of being safely passed through this chain of free radicals

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 the free radicals wander off and attack the fats

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 that make up the mitochondrion

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 and then those fats become peroxides

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 which are sort of a randomly destructive kind of free radical

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 so these would be the polyunsaturated fats that you're talking about

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 which, just for our listeners to clarify

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 includes the common vegetable oils available

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 like corn oil, sunflower seed oil, safflower seed oil, canola

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 also includes fish oil, hemp seed oil, flax seed oil

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 cotton seed oils and a lot of pre-processed packaged foods

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 yeah, and all of those tend to accumulate in the tissues

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 and when they are given acutely

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 as an emulsion for example, they used to do it in hospitals to fatten people up

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 now they do it to suppress their immune systems if they are transplanting a kidney

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 they not only suppress immunity

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 they create sort of an instantaneous diabetes

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 and inability to respire and use sugar

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 so it's like if we eat food that's fried in these oils

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 then we're essentially ingesting a free radical

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 well, very quickly, yeah

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 an experiment I did illustrates how even at room temperature

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 they spontaneously oxidize

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 I took a rubber hose in a bottle of I think it was safflower oil

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 and put the other end in a glass of water

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 and just at room temperature

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 over a few hours the bottle was in effect respiring

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 it was sucking oxygen up and drawing water up into the tube

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 and the oxygen was combining with the unsaturated fats

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 and in the process forming lipid peroxides

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 which are toxic free radicals

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 and the situation is even worse in our body when it's at 98 and above degrees

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 yeah, much faster at that temperature

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 and we have catalytic amounts of iron and heavy metals

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 moving around to accelerate the reaction

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 well, ok, you're listening to Ask Your Ob Doctor on KMUD Galbraithville 91.1 FM

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 we're very pleased to have Dr. Ray Peat join us again

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 and this month's subject was the topic of bowel endotoxin

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 so the number if you live in the area is 923 3911

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 or the toll free number is 1800 KMUD

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 so in 5 minutes or so we'll be opening up the number

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 sorry, 1800 KMUD Rad

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 beg your pardon

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 ok, I had another question for you Dr. Peat

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 I think just very briefly then perhaps if you want to outline again

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 what free radicals are and what foods promote or prevent the formation

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 free radicals and/or endotoxin

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 yeah, since the polyunsaturated fats are the main material that causes sort of an explosion of free radicals

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 once the process starts with endotoxin and nitric oxide

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 simply minimizing those in the diet is a basic way to defend yourself

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 there have been, for essentially 100 years

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 there have been studies showing that a fat free diet

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 if you give the required nutrients

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 a fat free diet extends life span and reduces cancer and other degenerative diseases

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 1927 study showed that there was no spontaneous cancer in rats on a fat free diet

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 and that has been repeated thousands of times in different ways

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 there are roughly 100 studies that show the tremendously beneficial effects

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 of even a short term deficiency so called of the polyunsaturated fats

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 when a rat is made deficient according to the way they define the deficiency

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 they simply don't feed them any polyunsaturated fats but give them purified nutrients

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 those animals can stand tremendous physical trauma that would kill a rat on a normal diet

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 and they can be given cobra venom and survive where a normal rat doesn't

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 toxins that would produce diabetes in normal rats doesn't hurt the so called deficient rats

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 basically any kind of abuse that they can think of

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 the fatty acid deficient rats are much much more able to tolerate and survive without harm

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 so why are we so brainwashed in this day and age to the point that these fats are called essential fatty acids

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 the people, the burrs who in 1929 through the 1930s were promoting that idea

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 were working for one of the big fat businesses, lard and then vegetable shortening businesses

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 and when independent researchers checked their claims in the 1940s

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 they found that what they had done was simply produce a vitamin deficiency

00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 because when an animal is not eating the polyunsaturated fats which poison the thyroid function

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 their metabolic rate is about 50% higher than the normal animals

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 and if they feed them only a normal amount of vitamin and protein

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 they become nutritionally deficient so these researchers at the University of Texas lab in the 1940s

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 had been working on vitamin deficiencies and they recognized that the burrs had simply produced their vitamin B6 deficiency

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 and so they gave a fatty acid deficient diet to rats and then gave them extra vitamin B6

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 and it cured the syndrome so the whole issue was settled in 1946

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 but in the 1950s the nutrition textbooks said that it's a controversial topic whether they're essential or not

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 because people were still promoting the idea that we need lard or vegetable shortening

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 and then the industry went through a big change when they discovered that

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 first they had economized on food consumption by pigs and chickens

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 by poisoning their thyroid gland with a chemical that turned out to cause cancer in humans

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 and so they looked for another way to poison the animal's thyroid so it wouldn't eat so much but would get fat

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 and what they found was that the polyunsaturated fats just as the burrs had demonstrated in 1932

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 suppressed the metabolic rate and that was when the feeding pigs a diet of essentially pure corn and soy

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 where the polyunsaturated fats took off.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 Before that they had fed them vegetable waste and whey industrial waste which was very good for the pigs

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 but they ate a lot of it and didn't get fat.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 They weren't good for marketing.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 The agriculture industry found that they could tremendously increase return pounds of pig per pound of food consumed

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 and since they were at that same time the paint industry discovered how to turn petroleum into paints and plastics

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 so they didn't need linseed oil or safflower oil anymore

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 and so there was this big industry, soy oil and so on, that wanted another market besides feeding pigs and chickens

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 and so they convinced people to eat their production that they couldn't sell as paint.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 And the story continues into 2009.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Then after 50 years the original data which was that the vegetable oils caused softening of the brain

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 and infertility and cancer and so on, that was known in the early 1940s.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 Finally that became too public that the essential fatty acids known as linoleic acid mainly

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 everyone was catching on that those were carcinogenic and caused heart disease.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 So about 20 or 30 years ago there was this gradual change of marketing

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 as the fish industry was being pressured by the Environmental Protection Agency

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 to stop throwing their waste skins and heads and so on in the bays or in the landfills

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 because they were causing tremendous pollution.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 That was when fish oil came on the market.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 They were making fish protein out of the skin and the head to sell to Africa as a food supplement

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 and the oil spoiled so fast they marketed it for human medical use.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 It's a lesson through history that wherever there's a waste product

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 there's always an agency or an industry to turn it into a profitable product.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 Yeah, shrimp shells are now a medical product and I'm waiting for used tires to come out of the whole food.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Rubber, it's good for you.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 Oh my gosh, I don't laugh, it'll probably happen but it'll happen so covertly

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 that we won't know it for another 50 years.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 Oh my goodness.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 I want to go back briefly to the point that you mentioned about the endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 being broken down by the liver.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 So we know that the liver is a detoxification organ

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 and I know that on several of our shows over the years we've kept on banging the message home

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 that you need to look after your liver because it's the thing that looks after you very much

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 in terms of metabolically deactivating some toxic metabolites and cleaning us, helping to stay clean.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 How do you view liver health or the improvement in liver health and how would you approach that?

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 The liver has several ways to catch toxins

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 but when it starts having to work too hard to detoxify things, the brain is our second most active detoxifying organ.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 It has very intense enzymes analogous to those that break down toxins in the liver

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 but if the liver is spending too much energy detoxifying, it becomes unable to produce albumin.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 Albumin circulating in the blood is one of the layers of defense.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 When the stuff gets into the bloodstream, the high density lipoprotein made in the liver increases when we're being poisoned

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 and so estrogen and alcohol increase the high density lipoprotein.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 And this is what the doctors are telling us is the good cholesterol.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 Well, it is good because it's a reaction to being poisoned.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 So it helps protect.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 When we're having a bowel problem.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 So if you have a low HDL, that may be not such a bad thing because it's indicating you don't have a high toxin load.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 Yeah, I think so.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 And the albumin circulating in the blood binds things preferentially fatty molecules

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 and so between the albumin and the lipoproteins, our blood can hold a lot of stuff temporarily

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 to give the liver a chance to catch up.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 As it repasses.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 Destroying them.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 Right, okay.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 Because I've heard of the albumin as being one of those factors obviously responsible for that colloidal osmotic pressure.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 Yeah, and when the liver is starting to be poisoned and estrogen and radiation can do the same thing as endotoxin,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 the ability to form albumin decreases.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 And so looking at the albumin in the blood test is one of the first indicators of a person's basic resistance.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 If it's high, their prognosis is usually good.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 And if it's down around 3, where the normal is 4.5, you're going to have to clean out the bowel.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 I've seen people in just a couple of weeks go from below 3, like 2.5, up to over 4 just by eating fiber and fruit juice.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 To reduce the absorption of the endotoxin.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 Do you figure the given reference range to be accurate?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 Well, yeah.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 The best prognosis is in the range of 40 to 50 or 4 to 5.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 And when it's below 4, they've put the normal lower and lower as people get thicker.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 15 or 20 years ago it was considered bad to be under 4.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 Now it's normal down to 3 point something.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 As we all get thicker.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 We have a caller on the line.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 We have a caller on the line for you, Dr. Peat.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 So, caller, you're on the air?

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 Yes, Dr. Courtney, I have a question for Dr. Peat.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 But I'd first like to make a statement.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 I'm living proof that this man is saying his real God-sent truth.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 I have Crohn's and have had for probably about 20 years.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 I've been diagnosed for about 8 years.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 And I've had four major surgeries.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 I've had all but 12 of my intestines removed and have a double ostomy.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 And by change of diet, I no longer have any Crohn's symptoms whatsoever.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 And it's along the same lines that Dr. Peat is speaking about.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 My question is, Dr. Peat, do common doctors understand these things?

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 And if they do, why don't they tell that to their families if they treat?

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 Sorry, can I interrupt you for a second?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 Can you, caller, if you haven't already turned your radio off,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 can you please turn it off?

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 We're having quite a lot of feedback here.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 Let it go away.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 The average doctor learns his high school courses very well.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 And then it happens that the medical school courses on the elementary canal

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 and digestive physiology are really just a repeat of what the junior high

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 and high school textbooks had in.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 So doctors get a very superficial picture of nutrition and digestion.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 I see.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 So possibly it is how I believe that they're just trained to be drug pushers

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 at a lot of medical pharmaceutical companies.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 Yeah, I think that's their basic function.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 I've been running into more and more fairly famous gastroenterologists

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 who are barely better than the junior high textbooks.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 Well, I thank you so much, sir, for all of your God-sent wisdom and knowledge.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 And I hope you have a long, long lived life, sir.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 Thank you.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 Okay, I think there's another caller on the line for you, Dr. Peat.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 And the lights are flashing.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 So go ahead, caller.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 Hello.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 I have a question, but I also wanted to mention that you had spoken last month

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 about raised heartbeat as being preferable.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 And that was the first I heard of that.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 But since then I've heard of that in another radio show.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 So, Dr. Peat, can you explain to us why the standard heart rate we're taught in medical school

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 is supposed to be between 70 and 80 beats per minute, and you've mentioned--

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 Or less.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 Or less, right, yeah, preferably less.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 Supposedly if you have an athletic heartbeat--

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 I've always told that low heart rate is healthy.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 Then you have a pulse around 60, and you're very healthy.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 You have a very healthy heart.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 So why do people feel better when they have a pulse above 80?

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 Because the brain needs oxygen and sugar,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 and just to keep all of the systems warm and respiring actively,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 unless you have a very, very big heart,

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 it usually takes around 80 or 90 beats per minute to pump enough oxygen and sugar around the tissues to keep them warm.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 And over the last 30 years, the normal temperature that doctors look for has decreased considerably.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 At the beginning of inventing thermometers, normal temperature was around 37 centigrade, 98.6 or so during the daytime Fahrenheit.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 And in recent years, the average temperature of Americans has decreased considerably,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 and that means that the heart rate can go slower, and the person feels that they're getting enough sugar and oxygen,

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 but they don't really feel as good as they should.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 I've talked to a few people who had temporary episodes of hyperthyroidism where their heart rate went 125 for a couple of months,

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 and they've reckoned consistently they say they never felt so good in their life.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 Obviously, just as an aside, since we started working with you, we've seen so many people with low temperatures,

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 and it's always the rarity to find a person with the right temperature, and yeah, it's kind of few and far between,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 but they certainly do react or respond rather to the protocols that you've outlined.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 There's another caller on the line for you, Dr. Peat.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 Sorry, Corin, are you done asking questions?

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 Because I know you wanted to ask a question about whether kelp and iodine-rich seaweeds are good for thyroid health,

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 and I don't know if you're still on the line anymore.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 Well, I've got in my file, I think it's about 80 articles on the toxic effects of getting excess iodine,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 and thyroid cancer is increasing at a tremendous rate, and I think part of it is the polyunsaturated fats,

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 but another part is a chronic, lifelong overdose of iodine.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 In various studies, taking more than twice the essential required minimum of iodine is enough to increase the rate of thyroiditis

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 and increase antibody attacks on the thyroid and so on.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 So when you sent me 20 articles detailing the thyrotoxic effects of excess iodine from sea vegetables and other sources,

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 that was just one-fifth of the articles you say you've seen that show this.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 Yeah.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 Right, okay, so we have another caller on the line.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 And there seems to be a little bit of feedback going on.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 I'm not sure if that can be managed in the studio or if that's external.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 Okay, caller, you're on.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 Hi, I had actually two questions at the same time.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 The first one was wondering if you could speak briefly about saturated fats and if they're beneficial or not.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 And then the other question was you mentioned staying away from the polyunsaturated fats

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 and maybe vitamin E and the field studies that you've done that seem that you can do to help people with OCD.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 I was just wondering if anybody could help so you could do co-accessories for field studies.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 And I'll take questions after that.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 Thank you.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 Thank you.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 Could you repeat the question?

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 I couldn't understand it.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 Okay, well, I could hear it.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 The caller was asking what are some protective things we can do.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 Dr. Peat, you've mentioned vitamin E.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 Oh, yes.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 Sorry.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 And also the co-enzyme Q10 and --

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 The lady wanted to know also about saturated fats.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 Yeah, the saturated fats are very protective,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 but you can make your own saturated fats if you eat enough sugar like fruits instead of bread.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 There are a couple of groups that are curing cirrhosis and hepatitis with giving more saturated fats

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 and excluding the unsaturated entirely.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 So they are anti-inflammatory and therapeutic,

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 but you don't necessarily have to eat the saturated fats because you can make them if you get enough sugar in the form of fruit.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 Okay.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 And so the other question was what other suggestions do you have to help reduce our bowel endotoxin load,

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 our free radical load on our bodies?

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 You've mentioned the CoQ10, the vitamin E, thyroid.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 Oh, anything that speeds transit through the intestine and aspirin or anything anti-inflammatory.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 The fruit juices contain some of the natural anti-inflammatory chemicals,

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 but in a pinch it can help -- aspirin surprisingly can act as a laxative because it suppresses nitric oxide

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 and defends against endotoxin.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 And the fibers that are protective and don't support bacterial growth are the basic way to stimulate quick passage through the intestine

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 and minimizing endotoxin formation.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 Raw carrots and boiled bamboo shoots are very good fibers because they're germicidal

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 as well as being able to bind the endotoxin and other toxins.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 So they not only help to kill these bacteria that are producing these harmful endotoxins,

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 but they also absorb them so you can excrete them.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000
 Yeah.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 Excellent.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 And the other herb we wanted to mention -- oh, sorry, we do have another caller on the line.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 Yeah.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
 We'll be right back with the herb.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 Go ahead, Carla.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 Thank you.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 Thank you, doctor.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 I've suffered from irritable bowel syndrome all my life or ever since I was a child.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
 And then the last three years I became vegan.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 And then in the last couple, like three months, I took wheat out of my diet.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 And I used to have irritable bowel problems for at least once or twice a week,

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 and I have noticed no problems.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.000
 I mean, very few before I took the wheat out of my diet once I became vegan.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 But once I took the wheat out, I haven't had a problem.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 And I would like you to address that.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 And please, could you explain really what's happening with irritable bowel?

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 Because, you know, they call it irritable bowel, but what is it really?

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 Thank you.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 It basically is the inflamed bowel, and it can -- the same chemicals that can cause the usual paralysis

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000
 that develops with aging and causes constipation,

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 those same substances can shift over to causing intensified peristalsis leading to diarrhea.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 But it's all an inflammatory process that is triggered by irritants.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 And wheat and other seeds contain chemicals that the plants --

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 the two major problems with any kind of seed, especially certain grains like wheat,

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 they contain their protein in a storage form, gluten,

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 which happens to resemble a protein that our tissues make under the influence of estrogen or stress.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 And so if a person has some problem dealing with the control of estrogen,

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 that predisposes them to react violently to the gluten

00:51:51.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 because the same sequence of amino acids exists in our own estrogen response protein and the gluten protein.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:11.000
 But besides the problem with the gluten, seeds all are -- they're the next generation of the plant,

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:20.000
 and so the plant puts its most intense toxins and defense substances into the seeds deliberately

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 to interfere with grazing animals and such,

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 so that you can take the enzymes that are needed to digest proteins,

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 and the substance in the seed won't affect that type of enzyme in the plant,

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 but it affects all animal enzymes.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 So they're specifically designed to interfere with animal metabolism.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 So the vegetarians forget how toxic the plants have to be

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 because they don't have the ability to fight or to run,

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 and so what they use is chemical defense.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 Chemical weapons.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 Okay.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 Well, Dr. Peat, I want to be a little bit selfish and cut off any more callers at this point.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 I know the lights are flashing, and do excuse me.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000
 I don't normally do this, but I do have one more specific question,

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 which relates to bowel endotoxin and bowel functioning,

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.000
 and I know from a newsletter that you haven't finished.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 It's something I know you've begun, and I've managed to get a copy of it,

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 that you're a pretty big exponent of cascara,

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 and cascara is a Pacific Northwest native tree called a rhamnus persiana,

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 and the Native Americans have used it for centuries as an effective laxative,

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 and the main constituents are things like anthraquinones with glycosides of imodin

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000
 and other alpha-alumodin.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 So what do you think of -- how do you view constipation as a cause of morbidity,

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 and how do you view the action of cascara?

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:16.000
 Well, all of these responses to inflammation tend to become progressive

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 and even lead to the death of some of the nerves in the intestine,

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 and so it's better to use any substance such as a plant drug

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 rather than suffer the consequences of inflammation,

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:47.000
 and it happens that cascara has structural analogies to many of our own substances.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 Vitamin K and coenzyme Q and progesterone have structural similarities to cascara,

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 and so what it's doing is reinforcing our defense systems,

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 and it's very unusual among drugs because it basically reinforces all of the good processes

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 and doesn't support any of the inflammatory toxic processes.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 So it's anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, helps to reduce anxiety, for example,

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 increases energy production the way thyroid and progesterone do.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 Everything that our own system does, it reinforces,

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 and my newsletter is going to talk about the history of related substances.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 Early in the century when free radicals were discovered,

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 a doctor in Michigan, W.F. Koch,

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 began working out the implications for how to defend our cellular respiratory system

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 from these toxins in the environment,

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 and one of the substances he worked with was the anthraquinone.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 He went to Brazil and the famous Brazil wood, it's red because of the anthraquinone,

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 but he explored all of the quinones that he could

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 and found that they work with vitamin E, vitamin K, and coenzyme Q and thyroid

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.000
 to maintain and protect respiration.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 Excellent.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000
 Well, I'm going to have to cut you short too, I'm afraid, Dr. Peate,

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 because it's 7.58 and a half.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 Dr. Ray Peate can be contacted via his website on www.rayPeate.org.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000
 No, .com.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 Oops, sorry, it's changed to .com, so rayPeate.com.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 For those of you who would like to consult further,

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 we can be reached on 1-888-WBM-ERB, Monday through Friday.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:22.000
 Thank you to all of you who listen regularly and those who tuned in this evening,

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000
 and thank you very much again, Dr. Peate, I would love having you on the show.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 And I know from the wealth of people that phone up

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 and the people that have tried to get on this evening,

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 I'm sorry that we cut you short a little,

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.000
 but I know that you're very popular and I very much appreciate you just spread the good news.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000
 And we're hoping that Dr. Peate will come visit us in Humboldt County

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 and do some more nutrition classes.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000
 That's right.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 So keep your ears open for that on a public service announcement.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 Look to the future, folks, and for those of you who have ears, let them hear.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
 Good night.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 Thank you. Good night.
