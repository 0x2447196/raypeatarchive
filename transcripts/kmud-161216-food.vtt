00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 Well, welcome to tonight's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.200
 And my name is Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.700
 For those of you who perhaps never listened to the shows, they run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.800
 We're both licensed medical herbalists who graduated in England with a master's degree in herbal medicine.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.900
 We provide a wide range of medicinal herb extracts from our own CCOF certified herb farm.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.900
 And we consult with clients all over the States on wide ranging subjects,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.500
 many of which we've discussed on the show even.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.700
 So, once again, very pleased to have Dr. Ray Peat with us to share his wisdom.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.300
 I've just got his latest newsletter.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.900
 He does produce pretty prodigious amounts of written work.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.400
 And I know some people sign up for his newsletters.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.700
 And I know there's been a bit of a shortage with his newsletters in terms of reaching the production that's necessary to fill people's desires.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.900
 So, that's good news and bad news in some ways.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.200
 So, Dr. Peat, you on the line with us?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.600
 Yes.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.900
 Okay, great.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.900
 What I think I want to do is just let people know that the show does run 8 to 8 o'clock.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.200
 It's a live program.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.700
 And I just want to let people know that normally we open the lines from 7.30 to 8 o'clock.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.700
 But just like to bring that point open now where if people want to call in,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:29.900
 because I've got some questions here from previous shows that people haven't been able to get on air to ask the questions.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.600
 And they've written them to me, emailed them to me.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.000
 So, I've compiled several of them.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.200
 And there are others I know that are out there that perhaps if they listen to the show now, they might want to call in any time.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.700
 So, the number if you want to call in, if you live in the area, there's a 707 number.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.400
 That's our area code, 707-923-3911.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.400
 And for those people, and it was written to by a gentleman in Australia earlier on today,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.900
 said he's had trouble getting through to the internet line.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.500
 But there is an 800 number.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.400
 It's 1-800-568-3723.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.300
 Although international callers would want to use the 707-923-3911 number.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.800
 That's correct.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.500
 Or if I'm not too sure what people do with internet-based calls to the show.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.400
 I'm not too sure if that's – does that happen?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.700
 People call in on Skype numbers?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.200
 No.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.700
 Okay.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.200
 All right.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.700
 Okay.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.700
 So, there's the 800 number, 800-568-3723 or a local number, 707-923-3911.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.200
 Okay.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:39.100
 So, for tonight's show, we're going to open up parts of previous shows based on inflammation.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.700
 And Dr. Peat's current work looking at autoimmunity, linking that to estrogen, linking that to

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.200
 inflammation and how the whole concept of cell energy is something that he's constantly

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.800
 advocating with thyroid hormone as one of the pillars.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.600
 Not forgetting things like progesterone, pregnenolone, vitamin D. Obviously, there's plenty of other

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.500
 supplements and nutraceuticals that we're going to be mentioning as we go on.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.700
 But Dr. Peat, would you, just in case people that tune in, we do get them fairly consistently.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.100
 They've heard the show for the first time or they heard the podcast for the first time.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.400
 They've heard of you for the first time.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.900
 And I was speaking or rather was written to by a lady who'd first discovered your works

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.100
 in 1990 and has been following your advice ever since.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.100
 So, there's a wide spectrum of people.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.300
 Would you just outline your background, your professional and academic background?

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:45.300
 I'm a PhD study at the University of Oregon, 1968 to '72.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:53.900
 Before that, I had been a graduate student and teacher in linguistics, philosophy, psychology,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.100
 English lit, among other things.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.700
 I see that one of your questions from last month, I think, was about the trophoblast

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.700
 theory of cancer.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.700
 Right.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:20.200
 And just when I was starting in my biology study in 1968, I had known a famous old cancer

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:32.300
 genetics researcher, Leonel Strong, and he was studying the curability of cancer, mammary

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:40.600
 cancer in the strains of mice that he developed by different types of liver extract.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.100
 And in thinking about that, I realized that there might be an overlap with the work he

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:57.240
 was doing with the old John Beard trophoblast theory of cancer, which was behind the lay

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.400
 trial treatment that we were in.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.400
 From almond seeds.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.400
 Okay.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:18.000
 The lay trial activates a process that its proponents thought just as a poison for the

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.460
 cancer cells.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:27.900
 But since it involved activation by the enzyme beta glucuronidase, which happens to be an

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:38.740
 enzyme that activates estrogen, I saw a link with Leonel Strong's work in which the cancer

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:46.060
 prone animals inherited from their mothers, the prenatal gestational conditions, they

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.580
 inherited a tendency to have high estrogen.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:58.380
 And he used a liver extract, the animals that he treated with the liver extract not only

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.740
 didn't get cancer themselves, but their offspring for several generations didn't get cancer.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.300
 And was that because of the vitamin B6 in the liver helping their bodies?

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:25.140
 He believed it was one of the nucleotide fractions that has analogs in the mainline cancer chemotherapy,

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.940
 but he believed it was stabilizing the DNA.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:42.260
 And my impression was that there were anti-estrogenic substances in the liver and some of them were

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.580
 also the nucleotides that Leonel Strong was talking about.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:58.860
 But anyway, the trophoblast theory, even though I think it's wrong in its details, it's extremely

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:04.580
 rich in its overlap of the actual facts of how cancer develops.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:14.620
 So the estrogen factor that Leonel Strong was working on and the role of enzymes such

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:22.900
 as beta glucuronidase, the late trial theory was based on, overlap with the trophoblast

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.900
 theory.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:38.100
 And the main treatment that people used going by the beard trophoblast theory, the pancreatic

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:44.420
 enzyme or extract to the pancreas were a main part of that therapy.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.940
 Okay, so I have a couple of questions I want to ask you about what you've just said as

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.940
 your statements.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:57.380
 You mentioned now the product later or that some people listening might recognize as the

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.780
 seed kernel extract from almonds?

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.780
 Apricots.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.340
 Apricots, sorry.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.340
 Apricots.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:10.780
 Okay, so wasn't the rationale for that that it would break down the sugar linkage and

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.620
 release cyanide and that's how it was kind of a…

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:21.860
 That was the Krebs idea that it was poisoning.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:28.700
 His theory was very nice except there was a theory for the late trial that he defined

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:38.020
 as the glucuronide, the molecule that he published had the glucuronic acid on it which would

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:49.300
 be specifically released by cancer cells or by any inflamed cell but would be poisonous

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:55.260
 only to cancer cells because they lack the ability to detoxify cyanide.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.820
 Right, right.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:04.300
 Now isn't beta glucuronidase an enzyme that breaks down the beta linkages, sugar linkages?

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:15.540
 Yeah, and the glucuronic acid happens to be how toxic substances are detoxified for excretion

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.940
 by the liver through the kidneys.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:24.820
 Estrogen glucuronide is the excreted, one of the main excreted forms.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.660
 It can be sulfate or glucuronide mainly.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:35.300
 I have a great liver mushroom pate recipe if people want to make that for the holidays

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.940
 and the mushrooms have anti-estrogen compounds in them too if you boil them down really well

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.420
 before you cook the liver with it.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.180
 Yeah, we mentioned the…

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.060
 You've mentioned in the past here the button mushroom extract which has been used as an

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.380
 aromatase inhibitor.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.180
 So that's another interesting point.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:58.860
 I wanted to get in later on tying these things together because there are lots of different

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:05.500
 herbs that have compounds in them that show anti-aromatase activity and that's very interesting

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.540
 in the concept of treating cancers.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:14.980
 There are plenty of literature out there from Native American cultures to cultures from

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:23.100
 other countries that use different herbs for carcinomas in situ, for skin cancers, for

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:30.060
 solid cancers, abdominal, etc., organ-based cancers and it seems like quite a few of the

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:36.860
 instances there is an aromatase inhibiting activity within that herb and that's probably

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:44.060
 would best explain by your understanding and what you've written and that would be a estrogen

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.460
 suppressing effect.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.940
 I guess we will get into that a little bit later on but I just want to run these questions

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.700
 by you from people who have tried to call in previous shows.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:00.980
 And the number again if you live in the area 707-923-3911 or there's an 800 number, it's

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:01.980
 800-568-3723.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.860
 Dr. Ray Peat's joining us once more.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.700
 And if you want to email me for the liver pate recipe, it's Sarah, S-A-R-A-H @westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:20.780
 All right, so I had a couple of questions based on sugars and one of them was does dextrinization

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.860
 and protein coagulation change complex carbs into simple sugars?

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.700
 Do you know much about this dextrinization?

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:40.660
 Yeah, it is a process that has been used for about 200 years.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:51.660
 The first form of it was basically what they used to make carob syrup, corn syrup, boiling

00:11:51.660 --> 00:12:05.380
 corn starch with sulfuric acid and it makes a pale, almost clear syrup but the longer

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:13.180
 you cook it and the harsher the acidic or basic conditions are, the browner it gets.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:25.260
 And the, when you talk about a browning reaction, molasses, they know that the brown stuff in

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.820
 molasses is mutagenic and carcinogenic.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:33.740
 Just like any charred carbohydrate is, right, or charred starch or sugar.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:44.420
 Yeah, and generally when you sort out the corn starch from the germ, you're still getting

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:52.540
 enzymes and there are amino groups spread throughout the starch part of the grain and

00:12:52.540 --> 00:13:01.260
 those amino groups participate in the classical browning reaction that makes these mutagenic

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.180
 carcinogens which have a brown color.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:19.260
 So the dextrinization produces some dextrose, some simple sugars, but that's a matter of

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:27.700
 how sweet and liquid it is or how viscous and gummy it is, depending on how far you

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.660
 carry the breakdown reaction.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:42.780
 So on average, dextrins are considered to have mainly groups of glucose molecules that

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:52.020
 are around 10 molecules long, 5 to 10 or 15.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:58.260
 Alright, so this is a process and it could change complex carbs into relatively simple

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:03.060
 sugars but not so simple because the simple sugars, obviously, things like glucose, fructose,

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.100
 sucrose, etc., just single units, subunits or two.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:14.900
 Yeah, the gumminess of it corresponds to the amount of starch left in it, broken up starch

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:22.780
 makes, turns the solid starch into a semi-liquid gummy material.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:30.460
 So like cane juice, if anyone has ever had cane sugar juice, fresh juice, it's very thin,

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.620
 very, very thin.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.980
 There's like basically zero starch in that, right?

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.620
 The refined cane sugar?

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.260
 Oh no, just if you have like fresh cane juice.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:46.260
 Or you just, they juice the sugar cane and they give you a little...

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.100
 Yeah, the sugar...

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.580
 It's very thin.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.540
 It contains sucrose itself so you don't need to process that.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.300
 Right, but I'm just saying that's why cane juice is so thin whereas corn syrup is so

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.340
 thick because it still has a starch in it.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.340
 Yeah.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:05.580
 Alright, and just to recap there, anything really to do with temperature and starches

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:12.540
 involving caramelization is, it can definitely be termed as carcinogenic in terms of the

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.180
 makeup of the caramelized products.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:25.220
 Yeah, at least as far as the combination with amino groups and amino acids and proteins,

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.700
 those are the best known mutagens.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.700
 But...

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.700
 The burnt toast.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:41.060
 Yeah, acrylamide turns up in every time you heat a natural carbohydrate that contains

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.380
 traces of amino acids or proteins.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:54.460
 And in the absence of the amino acids instead of acrylamide, you probably get small amounts

00:15:54.460 --> 00:16:00.900
 of acrolein which is another very toxic carcinogenic material.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:08.140
 And what about protein like meat and eggs, when they brown, is that also carcinogenic?

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:14.980
 There are traces of sugar in those and so you do get some of the same compound.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:25.500
 Alright, well another question was, do amylase or amylopsin help change complex carbs into

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.500
 sugars?

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.900
 I know amylase but I'm not too familiar with amylopsin.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.100
 Yeah, that's just a pancreatic amylase.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.100
 Got it, okay.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.340
 Alright, so this is amylase would be like a salivary amylase.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.340
 Yeah.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.980
 Okay, alright, so that was those two questions.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:49.420
 I had some other questions from another person based on diet and, you know, recommendations

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.420
 for diet.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.140
 They've been a long time listener.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:17:01.380
 They were also quite aware of your favorites in terms of foods from basic orange juice

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:10.140
 to your constant advocation of carrots, grated carrots and coffee for B vitamins.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.260
 In terms of general nutrition, I just wanted to recap for those people that maybe haven't

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:21.800
 listened too much before but in terms of calories for a female, what would you rate as being

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:29.060
 generally acceptable calories for relatively sedentary type work just so we can understand

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:33.380
 those people that perhaps they look at their food caloric intake, they'll probably recognize

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:39.660
 they're getting far too many calories and what is actually realistic to burn in somebody's

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.620
 healthy metabolism versus the calories they're getting from food.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.420
 So what do you think is a caloric intake for a female?

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:51.180
 I would 2,000 is a ballpark.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:59.340
 You can be very sedentary and still burn close to 3,000 and some people can be moderately

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:08.180
 active and get along on 1,700 and lots of people now are hypothyroid enough that they

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:20.900
 can move around with just ordinary daily activity and still gain weight on 700 or 800 calories.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.540
 So you really have to look at your metabolic rate.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.540
 And also if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, I know when I was full-time breastfeeding,

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.500
 I think I probably ate 3,000 a day.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.500
 And didn't gain weight.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.180
 No, and maintained weight.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:42.100
 Okay, how about proteins in terms of someone's intake for a female for example?

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:53.620
 The military did a big study on people mostly of military age in their 20s, both men and

00:18:53.620 --> 00:19:02.340
 women of all the different sizes that are in the military and found that to do just

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:09.460
 ordinary work, office work or whatever, both men and women needed at least 100 grams of

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.060
 good protein every day.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:20.820
 But you see lots of people getting by on 25 or 30 grams and I've known people always with

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:26.500
 pretty serious symptoms who were getting only 20 or even less grams per day.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.500
 Right.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:34.860
 Now do you expect things like tissue repair to be poor, muscle mass obviously not to be

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:41.820
 in evidence and difficulty maintaining skin, nails, hair, that kind of thing with low protein

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.820
 intake.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.820
 Yeah.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.100
 And it's hard if you're a meat eater, you could say, "Oh, it's easy," but then you don't

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.380
 want to eat that much meat.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.980
 You don't want to be eating meat three times a day.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.980
 It's too much meat intake.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.380
 So then you really have to rely on eggs, which you can't eat any more than two eggs a day

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.900
 because they contain some PUFA.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.340
 And so then you're left with dairy.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:07.020
 So really I think dairy is the primary source of protein that's healthy for people to be

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.020
 getting.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.020
 Yeah.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.620
 Well, I know you advocate gelatin a lot in terms of protein content and...

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:17.660
 Yeah, but that's not going to make up to 100 grams of protein when one eight ounce glass

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.940
 of milk has eight grams.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.060
 Okay.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:25.820
 And then what do you recommend for sugars?

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:33.900
 It really depends on your digestion, your intestinal health.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:43.820
 When I was in Mexico, I saw a lot of nutritionists trying to justify a bean and rice-based diet

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:50.900
 and there are lots of reasons that you can't get along very well.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:58.700
 Even though the amino acids seem to be equivalent to protein, it turns out that potatoes are

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:04.220
 infinitely better than beans as a source of protein.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:10.420
 But that requires, either of those require that your intestine be in fairly good health

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:19.140
 because the complex carbohydrates of either of those can support bacterial growth if you

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.700
 have a sluggish digestion.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.300
 Hang on, are we talking about juicing potatoes and cooking it?

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.300
 No, just...

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.620
 Yeah, if people were going to eat potatoes as a source of protein, they better have a

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.460
 pretty strong intestinal wall.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.460
 Right.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.220
 Otherwise, all that starch will irritate them.

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:37.260
 Yeah, because I know you advocate potato juice and use that in a double boiler to make a

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.300
 kind of scramble that's actually starch-free, isn't it?

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:46.180
 Yeah, that's for people who have a digestive problem but still need a very high quality

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.180
 protein.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.180
 Yeah.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:55.340
 Okay, so just to recap in terms of the amount of grams of sugar for somebody in a day to

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.340
 be...

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.340
 If you...

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:05.860
 The studies that I've written about in the late 1800s, they found that diabetics were

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:12.940
 putting out about 12 ounces of sugar in extreme terminal diabetes.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:18.900
 They had about 12 ounces of sugar in their urine every day as glucose.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:27.740
 And so they reasoned that they would die less quickly if they replaced that amount of sugar

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.780
 that they were losing.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:37.860
 And so they gave them a regular diet plus 10 or 12 ounces of plain white sugar and found

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:42.780
 that instead of dying more slowly, they got well.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:50.060
 So it depends on what stress your system is under.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:55.620
 Huge amounts of sugar like that can be curative if you're under stress and need something

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.380
 to compensate for the stress.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:06.940
 But if your digestive system is very healthy, you can get along just with starch instead

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.860
 of sugar.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:16.900
 You still need a few hundred grams of carbohydrate, either a starch or sugar every day.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:25.740
 So like we had a client who had broken his knee and ankle and had very extensive surgery

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:31.580
 and he was needing, I think, up to 400, I think a pound of sugar a day in various forms,

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:37.340
 you know, marshmallows and homemade marshmallows, sugar in the milk in order to sleep, to lower

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.980
 the amount of stresses he was recovering when he got out of the hospital.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.580
 That was what he needed to sleep.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.220
 And of course, he weaned himself off of that when he got better.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.460
 But initially, that was very curative for his sleep and his healing.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:59.420
 I've seen similar things in people with cancer or just extreme old age insomnia when they

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:08.620
 drink a little syrup like concentrate of sugar in milk or eat a bowl of ice cream during

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.820
 the middle of the night, they could get back to sleep.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:16.860
 Yeah, he went from not sleeping at all, like waking every hour and just completely restless

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:22.260
 and in pain, just sleeping all through the night, just from increasing his sugar.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:30.820
 Okay, so in terms of a daily diet, and I do get this question pretty often in terms of

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:37.780
 it's new to people and so they think initially the diet is pretty restrictive.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:46.580
 We've kind of produced a three-page or thereabouts breakdown of foods that we know from you and

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:53.580
 what you've researched that is healthy, thyroid supportive, anti-inflammatory foods and those

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:58.660
 kind of foods that are definitely to be avoided, obviously, the polyunsaturates which really

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:04.100
 kicked off this entire thing with you, with us seven years ago.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:09.860
 In terms of, I even ask you personally, what kind of foods that you would, you typically

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:15.660
 eat just to throw that out there and then we'll break down some of the foods here that

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.580
 may be not obvious that people probably don't eat too much of that, they don't know they

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:27.580
 can because it probably sounds like it's too either fattening or sugary or too problematic

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:28.580
 from another perspective.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:34.500
 But what kind of foods do you typically gravitate towards that keep you going?

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:45.780
 Two or three quarts of milk up to a gallon of milk per day, usually 1%, and usually one

00:25:45.780 --> 00:26:00.140
 big egg fried in butter typically, and orange juice as much as is available if it's good.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:11.980
 At least a pint, preferably more good sweet orange juice, and typically about once a week

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:24.740
 some oysters or some liver, almost every day some kind of gelatinous soup, tail soup or

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:30.460
 sometimes chicken soup with all the fat skimmed off.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.460
 Okay, well that's kind of key ingredients.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:39.000
 So Sarah, I mean because the person asked, they said they were very aware from listening

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.020
 to you and having, they came across you in the early 90s they said and they've been paying

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:49.700
 attention to you ever since in terms of your books and newsletters, but what they were

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:54.260
 asking for which was kind of, in some ways it was a little strange because they thought

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.420
 by now they would have recognized all the kind of foods that you do gravitate towards,

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:02.180
 but we've produced a pretty extensive list of those foods that are thyroid suppressive

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:08.020
 that people don't always recognize whether it's beans, nuts, seeds, you know, and that

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:14.940
 kind of typical polyunsaturated rich foods that would have a thyroid suppressing effect.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:21.380
 But I know Sarah's a very good cook and you do make some excellent food and so I'm very

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:25.900
 lucky to have that, so I don't ever find there's any shortage of variation.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.580
 I mean every now and again obviously we eat lots of different cheeses, we drink a lot

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.420
 of milk and orange juice.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:36.260
 We eat milk powder pancakes every morning that I make ahead of time so I don't have

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:40.460
 to make them every day and that's a pretty easy recipe if you can find some good organic

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.380
 nonfat milk powder.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.580
 How often do you eat the milk powder pancakes, Dr. Peat?

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:54.900
 Every day when we have the powder supply, then we run out of it and don't eat them for

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.980
 a few months.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:01.380
 Now I know what to get you for Christmas, Dr. Peat.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.660
 So yeah, we usually have one meal.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:09.420
 I try to tell my clients that if you split your meals up into proteins, you're going

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:14.540
 to have your liver or your oysters or your meat or your broth because it doesn't have

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.140
 to be heavy on the protein side, then you want to have that with one meal.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:23.700
 You want to have your dairy, like whether it's cottage cheese or homemade ricotta cheese

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:29.020
 is really easy to make or your milk powder pancakes and you can make them savory too

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:33.740
 and grill them with melted cheese on top.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.420
 Also you can do Greek yogurts.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:42.580
 There's some good organic Greek yogurts that are very, very high protein and not sour.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.380
 And then you have your egg meal and I tend to like eggs for lunch rather than breakfast

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.940
 because of the blood sugar lowering effect of the eggs.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:53.620
 I feel it's nicer to have something sweeter like the milk powder pancake for breakfast

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:58.020
 with coffee rather than having eggs with coffee because both of those things lower your blood

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.700
 sugar.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:07.380
 And then all the bone broths and the types of meats that are certainly good for you in

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:13.500
 terms of not being purely muscle meats like brisket has an excellent saturated fat layer

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.500
 on it.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.980
 And then lamb shanks are nice to roast.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.380
 Ox tail like Dr. Peat talked about, that's very gelatinous.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:26.460
 Otherwise if you have ground meat, I just sprinkle a little extra gelatin in there and

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:33.060
 maybe some leftover drippings from a roast I made to moisten it up and to give a little

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.060
 extra gelatin.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.060
 Okay.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.100
 Anyway, but that was one of the questions asked by somebody.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:43.500
 And incidentally, if people want to contact us anytime, Monday through Friday, you can

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:47.460
 either write, best thing to do actually is probably write an email to either Andrew or

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:53.620
 Sarah at westernmetallicalmedicine.com and we do have a pretty extensive sheet that we've

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.940
 produced about three pages or so.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.220
 And it's pretty much based around thyroid supporting and thyroid suppressive foods.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.020
 So it gives a pretty good overview.

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:05.980
 And for sugars, I mentioned the proteins for sugars.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.700
 I like to use honey.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.580
 We have our own bees and that's great to get a good raw honey.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.100
 Otherwise there's lots of honey available.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:21.060
 And sugar and milk or orange juice, honey or sugar and milk, orange juice, ice cream,

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.300
 fruit when it's in season.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:26.540
 Right now we're getting some really good little tangerines and satsumas.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.980
 We have a bunch of apples from our tree that are really ripe.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.780
 It's just important when you eat fruit that it's from an organic source and it's a ripe

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:33.780
 source.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:38.580
 I know Dr. Peat, you talk about how a ripe apple can be okay, but an unripe apple that

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:42.420
 was picked unripe can be very disturbing to the intestines.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:47.540
 Lots of the fruit in supermarkets aren't properly ripened.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:54.420
 Even plums are sometimes hard to digest and allergenic.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:58.420
 And things like dried prunes, you have to experiment with them.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.980
 Because a lot of them will give you gas, dried fruit will give you gas and it's just something's

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:02.980
 wrong.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:03.980
 I don't know.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:04.980
 What goes on with dried fruit?

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:05.980
 What do they do wrong?

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.260
 They use unripe fruit before they dry it, Dr. Peat?

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.940
 I think so.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:18.500
 When the polymers haven't broken down, they will feed bacteria rather than the person.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.540
 So you'll know whether it's easy to digest because if it isn't and it's not good for

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.860
 you, you'll be getting gas.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:27.020
 Isn't that a pretty good rule of thumb, Dr. Peat?

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.020
 Yep.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.020
 So getting on to another question.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.380
 One more thing I just want to mention is milk.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.580
 It's a very good source of high-quality sugar, lactose.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:40.500
 So one glass of milk has 12 grams of sugar, one glass of orange juice has 25.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:45.380
 So you can add extra sugar to your milk to make up your quota.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.340
 And I basically say 150 grams a day is like a diet level.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.020
 Wouldn't you say so, Dr. Peat?

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.020
 Yeah.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:56.940
 Well, for an active person, for someone sedentary, maybe that's the right amount to maintain.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:57.940
 Yeah.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:05.900
 And the lactose in milk is famous for helping to absorb the calcium, but some studies indicate

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:14.140
 that fructose or sucrose can serve the same purpose and spare the calcium in your diet.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:21.500
 So you can be deficient slightly in calcium and make it up by having enough sugar to keep

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:25.660
 the stress down so you don't waste your calcium.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:29.620
 And also, Dr. Peat, you said that people who think that they're lactose intolerant because

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:36.500
 when they drink milk they get terrible gas and indigestion, you can almost retrain your

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:41.740
 digestion, but basically remanufactured lactase so you can break down the lactose.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:45.180
 It's just if you're not drinking milk, your body will stop producing the enzyme to break

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.180
 it down.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.180
 It's as simple as that.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.180
 It's just science.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:53.660
 And especially if a person is hypothyroid in the intestine, it has trouble producing enough

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.020
 enzymes.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:33:00.180
 And also has trouble producing enough stomach acid and all sorts of digestive problems you'll

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.400
 develop with hypothyroidism.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:07.380
 So if you just take a tablespoon a day, and if you're really sensitive, you can start

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.740
 with like a half a teaspoon or a teaspoon and every day increase it.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:15.980
 Within a month, you'll have a full spectrum of enzymes because that's what it takes.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:21.980
 If you've studied pharmacology, you'll learn that it takes a month to fully manufacture

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.980
 the amount of enzymes.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.700
 But Dr. Peat, you were saying that it might only take two weeks.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:32.220
 Yeah, especially if your thyroid is good, you can change your enzymes more quickly.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:36.180
 And then the more you drink, the more enzyme you'll make and you'll be able to adjust to

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.180
 it.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:42.380
 So it's not like you can't ever eat dairy or eat cheese or drink milk again.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:45.980
 I just had another question here I wanted to get by.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:46.980
 It's pretty quick.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:47.980
 It won't take too long.

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.660
 I'm not too sure where they were going with it.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.300
 Red LEDs, I know we've done shows on red light.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:34:02.020
 They wanted to know if red LEDs would be sufficient for red lights as opposed to the 250 watt

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:07.140
 heat lamps that normally we're recommending.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:17.940
 Probably at least some of the wavelengths are enough to reactivate the respiratory enzyme.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:26.820
 And that's one of the best known but crucial effects of sunlight, incandescent light and

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.020
 some of the LEDs.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:40.340
 The respiratory enzyme copper atom in the darkness, it tends to be displaced from the

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:45.900
 enzyme causing failure of the respiratory system.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:51.900
 And the red light has just the right amount of energy to move the copper back into its

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.980
 proper oxidizing position.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.660
 Okay, cool.

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.460
 So red LEDs will work.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.060
 And then if people have them, that's all well and good.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:03.900
 Otherwise, red light from a good source 250 watt heat lamp.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.900
 Okay, we have our first caller here.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:10.460
 So let's take this next call and see where you're from calling.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.660
 What's the question?

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.660
 Hello, you're on the air.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:19.340
 We can hear your TV so we know you're there.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.340
 Hello.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:21.340
 Yeah.

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.340
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.340
 Hi.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.340
 Okay.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.340
 I want to know what you think about being a vegan.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:26.340
 Vegan eating...

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.340
 Go ahead.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:28.340
 Yeah.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:29.340
 I know, I'll let Dr. Peat answer the question.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.340
 I know it's very popular now.

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.340
 Being a vegan means you don't eat anything from an animal.

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:45.100
 Is there any way you can eat that way and be healthy and get enough protein and vitamin

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.100
 B and all that?

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.100
 Yeah, let Dr. Peat answer it.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:51.100
 I've got personal experience with this, but I know Dr. Peat's got a lot more.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.340
 So Dr. Peat.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:36:00.580
 The closest you can come to it would be eating potatoes and mushrooms.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:04.980
 Mushrooms are very similar to animal protein.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:16.340
 And your intestine can make vitamin B12, which is sometimes deficient in a vegan diet.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:25.180
 And so with the trace minerals of mushrooms and the high quality proteins and vitamins

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.660
 of potatoes, you can do pretty well.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:32.420
 But most vegans don't do very well.

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:36.180
 What do you think they're really deficient in, Dr. Peat?

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.180
 Oh, calcium.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.180
 Yeah.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:39.180
 There you go.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:43.140
 They break bones too easily once they get to be 60 or 70.

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:47.620
 Well, what is the advantage to being a vegan?

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.540
 I think it's usually an ethical thing.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:55.780
 They don't like to bother their animal neighbors by eating them.

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.020
 There you go.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.180
 It's mainly an ethical consideration.

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:07.140
 Oh yeah, they don't want to eat killed animals from big agribusiness and that sort of thing.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:12.660
 But living in a country, you can have your own goats and chickens and that sort of thing

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:16.180
 and raise everything you want.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:21.700
 Other than that, from a health point of view, it doesn't seem very healthy at all.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:30.220
 And I once heard that there was no natural indigenous cultures, let's say, that were

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.220
 vegan.

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:36.100
 There were some that are vegetarian in very hot countries where I guess it's hard to preserve

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:41.380
 meat and there's lots of fruit available and there'd be a different balance if it's really

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.860
 a hot country.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:49.180
 But there's no place where you're going to find a vegan diet among indigenous people.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.180
 Is that true?

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:58.220
 Some people have studied the Fulani people of Africa and found that they were pretty

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:04.060
 close to vegan but very sick, lots of heart disease.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:09.820
 So you mean from atheroma, from some kind of polyunsaturated damage?

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.980
 Probably because of the calcium deficiency.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.540
 Calcium is good for your heart?

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.900
 Very very important for your heart.

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.420
 How much calcium do you need a day?

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.820
 2,000 milligrams a day, which is basically two quarts of milk.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:26.780
 So you can break that down if you wanted to do yogurt, cottage cheese.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:31.820
 I take additional eggshell powder from my own eggs, ground up in a coffee grinder as

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:32.820
 fine as you can get them.

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:38.740
 A quarter teaspoon is about 600 milligrams.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.740
 Coffee has calcium?

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:47.140
 No, sorry, I grind the eggshell in a coffee grinder to make powder.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.980
 But coffee has some minerals in it.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.700
 Yeah, you say that coffee is good.

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.300
 I drink a cup of coffee every morning.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.300
 Good.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.780
 I think three or four would be better, but not in the morning.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:56.780
 Anyway, thanks for your call.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:57.780
 Alright, thank you.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.700
 Okay, we have another caller on the air.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.780
 Let's take this call away from, and what's your question?

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:11.220
 Spirock, I was wondering about the correlation of a high dairy allergy and I'm also a vegan.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:15.820
 So what will I do for calcium and protein besides the potato every day?

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.060
 What about eggshells?

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:22.780
 I was just talking, would you do eggshells or not because that's from an animal?

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:23.780
 Yeah.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.740
 Oyster shell, wow.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.700
 That's another animal, I guess.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.740
 Hard to swallow, isn't it?

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.140
 But you can put it in capsules.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.860
 I just swallow it down with a little water.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:36.140
 It kind of forms a little bolus and it's easy to swallow.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.140
 It wants to...

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.140
 You can't get it from like vegetables.

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.820
 Well, you can boil greens.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:47.460
 Leafy greens, if you cook them thoroughly and save the water, are a good source of calcium

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.700
 and magnesium.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:52.780
 How much do you think you would have to eat if you were strictly vegan and this is how

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.700
 you were going to get your calcium?

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.540
 About a pound, I think.

00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:00.620
 You'd have to boil a pound down a day and then drink all that water?

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:01.620
 I think so.

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:06.140
 And another way to help get the minerals out of the greens, especially those with oxalic

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:10.400
 acid, but even with kale, is put baking soda in it.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:14.860
 And that helps neutralize oxalic acid because oxalic acid that's in spinach and chard blocks

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:20.780
 your absorption of the calcium.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:24.980
 And you'll notice they cook much quicker and the liquid goes very dark colored because

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:29.900
 of the minerals that are leaching out of the cellulose leaf into the...

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.380
 What about the protein intakes?

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.660
 The protein, I mean, the fruit does have some protein, the potatoes.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.380
 How many pounds of potatoes would you have to eat a day, Dr. Peat, to get, would you

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:40.380
 say five pounds?

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.380
 Five pounds.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:42.380
 Yeah, there you go.

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.580
 So you could eat five pounds of potatoes or you could juice those potatoes better still

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.860
 if you didn't want to physically eat the bulk of five pounds of potatoes.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.100
 And are a lot of nuts bad for you?

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.100
 Say that again?

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.100
 Was that...

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.100
 Nuts.

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:56.100
 Is nuts bad for you?

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.100
 No.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.980
 Well, yeah, nuts have a lot of polyunsaturated fatty acids that are very estrogenic.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:05.100
 So a lot of nuts is not good.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.100
 That's correct.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:09.460
 And better to have more seeds.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.540
 Seeds and nuts are both very high in polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:13.940
 They're not a great source of protein.

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:17.740
 I mean, what do you think about the protein in nuts compared to the protein in beans and

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.740
 legumes, Dr. Peat?

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:23.980
 Oh, some of them are slightly better.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:34.340
 But the only nuts that I know of that are fairly safe for the fats would be the macadamias.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.340
 They're pretty saturated.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:39.060
 Macadamias are the better one?

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.060
 Yes.

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:44.380
 I don't know what the protein content of macadamia nuts are though.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.380
 It isn't very high.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:46.380
 Okay.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.380
 Well, thank you for your call, Paula.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.380
 Thank you.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:53.740
 And just a side note about that potato juice, I have made it.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.420
 Have you made it, Dr. Peat, too?

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.580
 Where you scramble the potato juice?

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.140
 What was that?

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:03.380
 Where you juice the potatoes and then you separate it from the starch and you scramble

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.380
 it?

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.380
 Yeah.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:06.380
 It's pretty tasty.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.380
 Oh, yeah.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:12.620
 It tastes pretty much like mashed potatoes when you put butter on it.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:16.140
 And if you let the potato juice, I noticed I had to let it settle.

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.340
 So all the starch went to the bottom and you can tell.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:23.020
 Like if you put cornstarch with water, the starch falls to the bottom and you can feel

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.020
 it.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.020
 It's starchy.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.700
 So with potato juice, it's the same way.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:30.900
 The starch falls to the bottom and you have this juice on top and you just pour that juice

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:31.900
 that's on the top.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:32.900
 But you have to let it settle.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:33.900
 Don't use it right away.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.900
 And it's all protein, isn't it, pretty much?

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.460
 Well, once the water's gone.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.460
 Yeah.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:46.940
 The slimy part of the juice is it should be sort of like egg white, depending on the type

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:47.940
 of potato.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:53.020
 Some of it is very gelatinous and cooks easily.

00:42:53.020 --> 00:43:00.380
 The others are kind of watery and you get a mushy mashed potato effect.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:01.380
 Okay.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.940
 So it's probably the waxy versus the floury potato.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:04.940
 Okay.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:05.940
 We have another caller here.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.420
 So let's take this next caller.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:08.420
 Call away from.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.420
 And what's your question?

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.420
 Bob in Willis.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:11.420
 Willis.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:12.420
 Hi.

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:13.420
 What's your question?

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:19.420
 We're getting involved with fermented vegetables, cabbage and all kinds of fermented vegetables.

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:24.020
 We're doing it ourselves and it's just terrific.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:30.780
 And it really straightens up the flora in your gut and throws your whole digestive tract

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:31.780
 in.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:34.780
 What do you think about fermented vegetables?

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:37.780
 I'll take the answer off the air.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:38.780
 Thanks for your call.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.620
 And did you hear that caller's question?

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:41.620
 Not most of it.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:42.620
 Fermented what?

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.620
 Vegetables.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.660
 He said he's been getting into making his own fermented vegetables.

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.180
 And what do you think about that?

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:52.460
 Oh, some of them taste very nice, like sauerkraut.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:57.940
 But I don't think there is much nutritional value in them.

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:06.820
 And there's a risk of getting bad fungus contamination in them.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:15.540
 In Asia, where fermented vegetables are very popular, they've seen a lot of stomach and

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:22.820
 throat cancer that comes from the fungal contamination of fermented vegetables.

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.980
 And what about the lactic acid content?

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:32.460
 Lactic acid puts a burden on your liver to turn it back into glucose.

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:37.060
 It takes more energy than you get out of the glucose.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:41.420
 So you think it's more nutritious to boil the vegetables rather than ferment them?

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:42.420
 Yeah.

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:48.540
 And what about the, the caller also mentioned about the gut bacteria, the probiotics?

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:54.020
 The small intestine, I think, is best when it's cleanest.

00:44:54.020 --> 00:45:01.900
 Very vigorous people with good digestion and high thyroid function have almost a sterile

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:08.580
 small intestine from their mouth to their appendix, basically.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.940
 There's nothing growing.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:17.700
 So they get a chance to absorb all of the nutrients without competing with bacteria.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:23.420
 Then in the healthy person, the bacteria grow just in the colon.

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:30.580
 So you don't want to support bacterial growth higher up in your intestine.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:40.060
 The H. pylori is an example of much too high in the digestive system for bacteria to live.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:47.580
 I just had a throat swab done and it was, they couldn't find anything in my throat swab.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:53.620
 So the doctor said there's something wrong because your mouth is sterile.

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.580
 Anyway, we have another caller.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.700
 I just wanted to put out the number again for those people that listen to the show.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.180
 We've gotten to eight o'clock here.

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:03.180
 Dr. Ray Peats, very kindly joining us again.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.180
 Okay.

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:12.860
 Number is 707-923-3911 or 800 number for those folks in different parts of the States.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:16.300
 1-800-568-3723.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.180
 So we have another caller on the air.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.420
 What's your question and where are you from?

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:21.420
 Yes, Colorado.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.420
 Colorado.

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:23.420
 Welcome.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:30.580
 And the question is, how would I find out if my methylation is interfering with my vitamin

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.460
 D absorption?

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:39.660
 I tried a therapeutic dose, a higher therapeutic dose of 12,000 I used for a couple of months

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:47.980
 and I did bring the level up to 73, but my symptoms persisted that I'm trying to figure

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.420
 out what to do.

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.780
 I went from 30 to 73.

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:53.780
 Okay.

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:58.540
 So Dr. Peat, did you hear that?

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.180
 The line's not that great, but...

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.180
 I'm sorry.

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:02.180
 That's okay.

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.180
 Methylation.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.180
 Yeah.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.180
 How would I know my methylation is working?

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:09.340
 Dr. Peat.

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:10.340
 Vitamin in general?

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.620
 I think she's saying in relation to B, B vitamin.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:13.620
 No, D. I'm sorry.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.620
 D as in dog.

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:15.620
 Oh, D. I beg your pardon.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:16.620
 Okay.

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.620
 I know, because I was saying, I just wrote a note to Andrew.

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:21.620
 I said, "What B vitamin?"

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.620
 Yeah.

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.620
 Okay.

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.620
 It's D.

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:28.060
 D, vitamin D. Have you had your vitamin D blood level checked?

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.060
 Yes, I did.

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.060
 It's 73.

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.060
 Yeah.

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.060
 Oh, that sounds plenty enough.

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.060
 That's pretty good.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.060
 That's good.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.900
 So what, in terms of methylation, you were saying, because I thought we were dealing

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:41.500
 with methylating vitamin B12 and that being an issue.

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:42.500
 Right.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:51.340
 I understand that the receptor sites of vitamin D may recede if your methylation is not correct.

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:54.060
 Dr. Peat.

00:47:54.060 --> 00:48:01.500
 I would guess that any symptoms you have that are related to vitamin D might be from not

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:09.500
 having enough calcium and magnesium or maybe having too much phosphate in your diet.

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.260
 Okay.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:23.380
 It's important to have more, on a molar basis, more calcium than phosphate in the diet.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:30.780
 Americans often have five or six times too much phosphate relative to calcium.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:36.380
 Because of the high meat intake and the high starch intake and the high bean and grain

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.380
 intake.

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:45.220
 Well, I've been about nine months without any, one meal of some meat a day.

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.500
 And what about calcium?

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:51.220
 I drink about two or three quarts of milk a day.

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.460
 Well, that should be adequate for calcium.

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:54.460
 Yeah.

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:56.540
 What are the symptoms you associate with the vitamin D?

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.780
 I get a headache in the middle of the night.

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:00.780
 What about sugars?

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:02.020
 How much sugars are you getting a day?

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:06.260
 I get lots of sugar.

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:11.380
 I drink milk all night long with sugar and honey.

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:13.740
 And I eat marshmallows.

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:19.020
 It used to be coffee that would take the headache away, but now I found marshmallows help better.

00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:20.860
 And gelatin?

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:26.860
 Do you eat any antiseptic fibrous food like raw carrots?

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:27.860
 Yes.

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.260
 Every day.

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:30.860
 What about your thyroid function?

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.900
 Have you tested your temperatures and pulses?

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:33.900
 Yes.

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:37.140
 I can only keep it up to about 98.

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.140
 I can't get higher than that.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:45.820
 Well, that could be a big problem because if you're below 98, your immune system's at

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:46.820
 like half power.

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:47.820
 It's only 50% functioning.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:48.820
 Exactly.

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:52.700
 And so I think I have some kind of mycoplasma.

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:59.380
 I've been taking the tetracycline low dose for about six months now.

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:02.100
 And it has not changed it.

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:06.820
 And so I was thinking I was going to have to...

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.420
 Did you identify what mycoplasma it was?

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.420
 Not yet.

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:14.860
 I think I'll do a nasal swab and try to find out because it seems to be connected to my

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:18.060
 trigeminal nerve neuralgia.

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:20.140
 What about your liver function?

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:24.580
 Liver function has come back to a normal function because I've been on this diet.

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:27.420
 Yeah, that's definitely diets and a long time.

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.380
 Have you tried aspirin?

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.380
 I do.

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:34.180
 I'm up to three aspirin three times a day.

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.380
 I take every six hours.

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:37.940
 You're taking vitamin K?

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.860
 With vitamin K, yes.

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:40.860
 Good.

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:45.740
 What do you think about the thyroid function helping the...

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:49.580
 How much thyroid do I take a day now?

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:56.460
 I'm up to 1.75.

00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:01.540
 I'm up to 1.75.

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.540
 So how it is...

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:05.740
 And I take the T3 also with meals and between meals.

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:12.500
 How it works with thyroid is some people need like two micrograms.

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:14.020
 Some people need 200.

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:16.340
 It depends on your body.

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:21.340
 And the best way to tell is with your ankle reflex and also with your temperatures and

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:27.900
 pulses and if you can't get your temperature up above 98, then you don't have enough thyroid

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:28.900
 basically.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.100
 Unless I have a bad stress day and then it'll go up.

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.100
 Yeah.

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:38.020
 Well then that's just adrenaline raising it but you'll notice it will fall after meals.

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:46.940
 Sometimes a mysterious headache can be traced to a single supplement or a single food that

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:52.460
 you might have only once a week causing an allergic irritation.

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:53.460
 Yes.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:52:00.460
 I think I found that the microbial enzymes in cheeses and I try to find the very best

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:01.460
 I can find.

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.860
 I'm going to eliminate that and see if that doesn't make a big difference.

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:07.420
 Because you can definitely find cheeses.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:12.540
 It's not so much a plug but it's just a fact that Costco do actually sell some very good

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:16.460
 European cheeses that are made with animal rennet and not microbial enzymes.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.060
 Thank you very much for that.

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:26.180
 And the two cheeses that we know are made with animal rennet are the Parmigiano Reggiano,

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:30.640
 the very hard Italian Parmesan and then also the sheep and that's cow's milk and then they

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:34.040
 have a sheep's milk Pecorino Romano.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:38.580
 Those are both very traditionally made cheeses and people that have sensitivity to cheese

00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:40.980
 don't find any problems with those two.

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:41.980
 Very good.

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:42.980
 Thank you for that suggestion.

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:47.180
 I'll keep on going but I appreciate all the help you've given me.

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:48.180
 You're welcome.

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.180
 I really appreciate it.

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:50.180
 You're welcome.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.180
 Thank you for your call.

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.180
 Okay.

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:55.940
 Well it looks like we do actually have another caller who's calling in now so I didn't get

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:59.180
 a chance to really ask you any questions Dr. Peat about this month's subject but that's

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.180
 not a problem.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:04.040
 I'm glad people have got their answers to their questions and there's one more person

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:08.120
 here who their call is being fielded to see if they actually want to pose a question or

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.120
 they just have comments.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.120
 Yeah, it does.

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.440
 Okay, so let's take this next caller away from.

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.440
 What's your question?

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.440
 Hi, it's Scott from Ontario, Canada.

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.440
 Ontario, Canada.

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:22.960
 My question I'd ask you, just a quick one hopefully, when raising calcium and getting

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:28.720
 heartburn, what would be the cause and secondly what to do for oily skin?

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.720
 Okay.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:33.680
 So wait a minute, you said when you increase your calcium intake you get heartburn?

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:39.400
 Yeah, so if I'm drinking two quarts of milk a day and having lots of cottage cheese and

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:44.120
 then trying to use extra eggshell or calcium carbonate and then getting like a heartburn

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.120
 reaction.

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:49.080
 Do you know if you get it specifically just to the eggshell when you take that in isolation

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.320
 or without food though?

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.000
 Are you aware of that or do you take?

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.520
 Or the cottage cheese if it's very acidic.

00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:00.880
 Yeah, I think the only one I add in like the extra, like the supplement of calcium carbonate

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:01.880
 or eggshell.

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.840
 How much eggshell are you taking?

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:06.840
 About half a teaspoon.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:07.840
 Half a teaspoon.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.480
 At a time or during the day?

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.480
 At a time.

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.480
 That might be too much.

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.120
 I take like an eighth of a teaspoon at a time but then I drink a lot of milk so if people

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:21.000
 don't drink milk then you'd need to take like a quarter teaspoon at each meal with the food,

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 after the food.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.640
 And you definitely want to take it with food because it...

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.000
 I have, yeah, I've noticed people...

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.400
 Quite a lot of people talk about upset...

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:32.280
 It's usually more loose, it causes their stools to be loose or hard.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:36.600
 But Dr. Peat, what would you think is contributing to this gentleman's heartburn?

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:46.360
 Oh, lots of people get stomach irritation from calcium supplements and magnesium supplements.

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:56.640
 When manufactured or in an excessively pure form, the eggshell is almost a pure calcium

00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:04.680
 carbonate and your stomach and intestine have trouble with pure chemistry.

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:13.640
 The more mixed substance is like milk, is extremely complex and so it's very soothing

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:17.560
 to the digestive membranes but any pure chemical...

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:21.600
 It sounds like a good rationale against pharmaceuticals.

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:22.600
 Yeah.

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:26.120
 Okay, so the question about the heartburn, what do you think of that?

00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:31.000
 And then oily skin, I think, was the other part of the question.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.440
 In general, oily skin is very good.

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:38.180
 It ages very slowly.

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:44.520
 If you have oily skin when you're 25 or 30, you'll probably have young looking skin when

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:50.400
 you're 60, just because it's metabolically so active in general.

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:54.880
 So it signifies a good thyroid function in terms of the turnover?

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:55.880
 Usually yeah.

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:56.880
 Yeah, good.

00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:01.440
 Okay, so did you have any other comments about the heartburn though from that caller regarding

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:02.440
 the calcium?

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.560
 Is the caller still on the air?

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.560
 I'm still here.

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:06.560
 Yeah.

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:08.560
 Do you take it with a big shell and an empty stomach or after food?

00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.760
 No, I take it with food.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.600
 Okay, well maybe it's just too much at once.

00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.600
 What do you think, Dr. Peat?

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.720
 Half a teaspoon at a time is maybe a little intense?

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:18.520
 Yeah, I would just skip it for a week and see what happens.

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:23.120
 I mean, if you're getting two quarts of milk plus some cottage cheese, you're probably

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.120
 good.

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.880
 Yeah, I think I am good.

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:31.240
 I'm just trying to really push that calcium phosphate ratio.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.520
 How much meat are you eating a day?

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.240
 I'm not doing any meat right now at all.

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.360
 I'm doing basically all dairy and fruit, cooked fruit.

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:40.720
 Well, that's a diet very low in phosphate.

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.080
 Dairy is not high in phosphates.

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.080
 Yeah.

00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:47.360
 He's trying to increase the calcium to phosphate ratio by bringing his phosphate consumption

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.360
 down.

00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.360
 How much, are you taking vitamin D at all?

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:54.400
 Yeah, I do take vitamin D, vitamin A, E, and K.

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.240
 Yeah, especially up there in Canada.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.120
 Don't take too much A.

00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:01.880
 Sometimes vitamin A can be irritating to the intestine.

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:06.440
 I had to stop using it orally several years ago and use it only on my skin.

00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.960
 There you go, because it's fat soluble.

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:12.440
 Planet thyroid suppressive, how much A were you using a day?

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:13.440
 Are you using it?

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.440
 It depends.

00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:20.920
 I try to do it orally or transdermally, so usually maybe five to 10 every couple of days,

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.520
 about 10K.

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:26.480
 That might be a little bit too much for your thyroid function because if you ate four ounces

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:32.480
 of beef liver, it typically has on average about 10,000 units and you would want to eat

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:36.280
 four ounces of beef liver once a week, so that might be a little bit too much A.

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.280
 Okay.

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:42.560
 Okay, well, thank you for your call anyway.

00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:47.080
 We're right to the top of the hour now, so it's kind of coming to the close of the show.

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.080
 Appreciate your time.

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.080
 Thank you very much.

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.080
 You're welcome.

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.280
 Dr. Peat, are you still there, Dr. Peat?

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.280
 Yeah.

00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:55.280
 Yeah.

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.280
 Thank you very much for joining us again.

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:57.280
 We're at the closing show of 2016.

00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:02.600
 We'll look and see, gee, I think by the third Friday of next month, we might have a new

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:08.960
 president and we might have got through the ups and downs of the contentious ongoing electoral

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:14.160
 results with the college and yet to cast their final vote on the 19th.

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.200
 And it's been, it has been eight years.

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:18.560
 And Dr. Peat first joined us on the show in 2008.

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.960
 I thought it was seven, but yeah, okay.

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:24.840
 You said it has only been seven years, but yeah.

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:25.840
 It was 2008.

00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:29.840
 Dr. Peter, thank you very much for your time.
