WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720
 Well, welcome to this month's March the 20th, 2020 edition of Ask Your Arab Doctor on KMED

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.000
 Gagabor 91.1 FM. From 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you'll be invited to

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.120
 call in with questions related to this month's very specific topic of the worldwide frenzy

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:29.980
 surrounding the coronavirus. Dr. Peat is going to be joining us and he's bringing a very

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.280
 interesting mental shift in the way that we're looking at this to bear. And just want to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.520
 state at the very outset of this that it's a very emotional subject and no one is taking

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.200
 death lightly. When you've got loved ones that are dying, it's absolutely no joke. So

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.440
 while some of the comments may seem a little light on it in terms of statistical numbers

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.200
 and some presentations from a Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg in Germany, I will give information

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.960
 out for people to search all of this on the internet and see for themselves how some of

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:18.080
 these statistics have been extremely skewed and that the data can be seen fairly clearly

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.920
 from several other sites around the world that monitor outbreaks of viral pneumonia.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.680
 So Dr. Peat, are you with us? Yes. Okay, thanks so much for joining us. As usual at the beginning

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.400
 of the show, I always ask you to introduce yourself so that people who are listening

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.960
 to the show, maybe haven't listened to you or heard you before, can find out a little

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 more about you. And at the end of the show, we can give out your website where people

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.760
 can go read some of the abstracts and articles that you've written and find out some more

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:59.680
 about you. Okay. I got a Master's of Arts degree in 1960 from University of Oregon,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:10.720
 then a PhD in 1972 specializing in physiology and biochemistry and have been concentrating

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:21.200
 on reproductive and aging biology but with special attention to the nervous system and

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:31.160
 how nutrition interacts with those changes. And it turns out I never was at all interested

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:40.080
 in virology, but it happens that this particular virus impinges exactly on the things that

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.440
 I've been working on for a long time, inflammation, aging, and cellular respiration.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.880
 Excellent. Good. Okay. I know we've spoken the last few days here to thrash out some

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:05.120
 of the details surrounding the very alarming, certainly media alarming information and the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.840
 lockdown statewide in California and across the states in America, similar to what they

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.720
 did in China. Anyway, without going too far into that, I think what I would like to try

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:26.840
 and do is to just outline influenza to people. I think a lot of the terms confuse people.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.600
 I think there's a lot of terms and a lot of, you know, synonyms given to things and that

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.680
 people need to understand what it is that we are working our way through here, what

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.760
 we are dealing with, influenza, and the various designations given to these influenzas of

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.440
 which there are four, type A, B, C, and D, with only really type A, producing all of

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.920
 the major flus, the Spanish flu and the Asian flu, Hong Kong flu, the bird flu and SARS

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.400
 and MERS, et cetera. These are all the things that I think have come to the public attention

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.040
 over the years with, in the last 15 years for sure, the potential pandemics that never

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.560
 did become pandemics, but certainly were very fatal to those great percentage of people

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:24.200
 that got them from the MERS and the SARS. So influenza, I mean, when most people get

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.200
 a common cold, a common coronavirus, it is another coronavirus, so let's not keep them

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.680
 separate so people can understand that the common cold is the same type of genera of

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.400
 virus as is influenza. And that the main issue I think with this, before we get into some

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:53.080
 of the political and some of the actual facts around statistics that have really, I think,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.080
 alarmed people, and not just to mention the people that have been shown in hospitals and

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:06.160
 on ventilators, and unfortunately for those people that have died, it is extremely tragic.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:14.480
 I'm not saying or downplaying it in any way. So influenza, as far as I know, the main thing

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:22.160
 with influenza is the massive amount of inflammation that comes as the body's immune response to

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:31.960
 the virus, and it's a severe complication that we get viral pneumonia, and that is and/or

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.640
 secondarily bacterially infected. And then so that you can get various strains of bacteria

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.480
 that wouldn't normally take up residence in the lungs that can become overwhelming to

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.440
 a system that's already crashing because of the inflammation.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:57.000
 Yeah, when a person gets a verified influenza virus, for example, a typical analysis will

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:07.520
 find various other viruses like common cold viruses and other respiratory pathogens as

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:16.520
 well as the true influenza virus. So even when there's a confirmed definite flu virus,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:25.920
 you can't be sure that that's really the culprit because like at present, most of the people

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:35.360
 getting seriously sick or dying are old, definitely beyond their mid-50s, and the highest mortality

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:47.160
 is over 70. And one place said that 99% of the people dying with the coronavirus were

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:55.960
 suffering from other very serious things such as diabetes, hypertension, stroke symptoms,

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:03.200
 and things that made it much more likely that they would die from a stress. But also other

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.320
 pathogens take advantage of that weak condition. And then just because you have one particular

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:17.320
 pathogen that you have a test for, you can't be sure that that is really a contributing

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.080
 factor even when there are so many other pathogens present.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:29.920
 Yeah. Okay, so somebody catches a species of virus known to cause influenza and that

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:37.980
 then either does or doesn't become complicated. We've heard a lot in the news about this particular

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.680
 outbreak and we'll get into the, you know, whether it's a zoonotic infection or whether

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:50.840
 it's weaponized and all of the things that have come out that are seemingly plausible.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.520
 But I know we've got some facts coming out that I'd be very interested to hear from you.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.880
 What you mentioned a couple of days ago, and I don't know how long it will take for that

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:06.680
 to propagate, but we'll find out from you in a moment. But the actual death rate really

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.240
 is as you said, it's from the older populations, although there's been reports of people, young

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:17.360
 people, old middle-aged people, have suddenly got the complications of this infection which

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.720
 have become viral pneumonia and overwhelming inflammation. And that's how they suddenly

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.240
 end up short, very short of breath and then needing ventilation in a hospital environment.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.280
 And it's the seemingly overburdened hospital system with those kind of cases that seems

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:43.640
 to be making the drastic news. So, so far as, let's get into the, let's get into the

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:52.200
 origin of this because I think most people are just buying the standard kind of doctrine

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:59.760
 that this is coming out of China, it's a Chinese origin, it's come from a wet market and there's

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:06.000
 a zoonotic infection meaning that animal species that naturally have their own influenza, because

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.600
 it's not just human beings that suffer from influenza, but bats and pigs and camels and

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:18.560
 mice and civic cats, etc. Many species have their own type of influenza. But rather than

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:25.920
 the news talking about the wet markets and originating in Wuhan, you came out with some

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:34.160
 very interesting facts, interesting, controversial or shocking news about it. And in terms of

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.960
 the gene sequencing that's happened, it's quite interesting for people to hear this,

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:43.560
 so would you outline what you've understood as an origin for this?

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:51.600
 The virologists in Europe and the United States, South Korea, Taiwan, as well as China have

00:09:51.600 --> 00:10:05.480
 the Chinese refer to the DNA sequence analysis as showing that the trunk of the series of

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:18.600
 the family tree is in the United States. There are five different branches or varieties occurring

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:31.080
 early in the United States before the strain in China identifies as the fourth or fifth

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:42.720
 branch off this trunk. And that's based on the fact that they're analyzing substitutions

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:56.800
 of bases in the DNA chain. And when you see three different changes, the third one, if

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.320
 you have one with two of the changes and then a third one with three changes and then a

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:10.760
 fourth with four changes, the ones with the fewer changes necessarily came before the

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.760
 last one.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:18.080
 This is like a phylogenetic tree in botany, right, where they classify the PCO.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:26.600
 The family tree of this virus shows that the one occurring in November in Wuhan will be

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.920
 the fourth or fifth descendant of this virus.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:38.800
 So what's the position on where this would have perhaps come from then?

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:47.720
 People have been pointing out, for example, a 2015 article in Nature magazine was just

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:57.840
 a news item mentioning that people connected to the CDC, I think working at Fort Detrick,

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:09.160
 Maryland, were working to produce a vaccine to the coronavirus. They were creating pathogens

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:17.160
 to develop a vaccine in advance so that when a natural epidemic broke out, they would have

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:24.440
 a vaccine ready because normally it takes 12 to 18 months to prepare a vaccine for a

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.840
 new strain.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:34.320
 And by that time, the flu season has passed. And so the vaccine doesn't do much good. This

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:42.920
 was pointed out in 1976 in connection with the so-called swine flu pandemic, which never

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:53.840
 existed. And the man who pointed out that the whole idea of making a vaccine for influenza,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:59.880
 a disease of that sort, which mutates rapidly and the vaccine production takes at least

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:06.600
 a year, that the whole thing, he said, was conceptually fraudulent.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:13.880
 So he got fired and the government announced a pandemic, but basically only one person

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:19.400
 died from that virus. So it definitely wasn't a pandemic.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.400
 And that was back in 1976?

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:29.280
 '76, yeah, the swine, great swine flu pandemic, in which the only people died were a few hundred

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.840
 from the vaccine and a few thousand that got paralyzed from the vaccine.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:40.720
 Wow. Okay. So basically what you're saying is that when virologists look at the gene

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:48.680
 sequencing of the current coronavirus and then they can see the genetic changes saying

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:55.160
 that there were four or five different steps before it, meaning that the current or the

00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:01.680
 one that broke out in Wuhan had ancestors that they'd already known about in the United

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.680
 States.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:11.560
 Yeah, but if the CDC could, in their lab, experimentally produce a pathogen that might

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:17.040
 naturally occur, if they could produce it before it naturally occurred, then they could

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:22.880
 have their vaccine ready for it. So they were working on that. That was reported as a news

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:31.760
 item in 2015 in Nature. But right below the title of that news item, the editors last

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:39.720
 month inserted an editorial note that people have been citing this as indicating the possibility

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:49.360
 that the virus escaped from the CDC's Fort D'Etre lab. They said that wasn't a proper

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.760
 thing to suggest.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:59.840
 But even if it wasn't an escaped virus from a bioweapons lab, if they were working on

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:05.880
 viruses that occur naturally and trying to find vaccines for those viruses, then...

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:11.640
 Yeah, that was a perfectly proper thing to do, according to their... They patented a

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:23.840
 coronavirus in 2003 specifically to work on that project. So there was nothing improper

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:31.400
 conceptually that they wanted to be ready with a vaccine. But that was a 2015 news report

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:40.040
 in Nature magazine. And then last summer, either July or August, it was in the news

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:47.760
 that the CDC had ordered the closure of the virus lab at Fort D'Etre because they had

00:15:47.760 --> 00:16:00.280
 carelessly let their escape protection system deteriorate and their water filtering system

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:08.400
 wasn't working. So they closed the lab because of the danger of an escaped virus. That was

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:14.880
 in August of last year, just two months before the outbreak.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:25.480
 And then American soldiers have been participating in international military athletic contests.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:35.880
 It's been an opportunity for Olympic athletes to practice becoming soldiers so they can

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:44.240
 full-time train while still being an amateur. And normally, they've scored very well in

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:55.600
 world competitions. But last year, for unknown reasons, there were either 180 or more soldiers

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:05.960
 there in the competitions. And they came in 35th in rank among all of the countries of

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.960
 the world.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:12.000
 The US soldiers came in 35th in the competition that was held in Wuhan.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:21.840
 Yeah, that's what I've been reading. And the Chinese were ridiculing what miserable

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:31.520
 athletes they were and commenting on whether that reflected on the American army. But normally,

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:36.240
 the army athletes were outstanding Olympic quality.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:42.320
 Interesting. So it went from what you would normally expect in an Olympic competition

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.560
 presentation, you'd have people of the highest level. It went from that, what would normally

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:55.720
 happen to a stunning 35th place and comments about how amateurish the competitors from

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.720
 America seemed.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:05.320
 Yeah, the Chinese in particular were saying it was hard to imagine why they came in so

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.320
 poorly.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:13.640
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Doctor on KMED Garbleville 91.1 FM from 7.30 to the

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.440
 end of the show at 8 o'clock. You're invited to call in with questions related to this

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:25.400
 current pandemic and the frenzy and hysteria that's been generated for sure about COVID-19.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:36.920
 So Dr. Peat, you were also mindful that when I first heard it, I just couldn't quite believe

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:45.320
 it but the potential source of this could potentially have been from this country. And

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:52.680
 that I know there's been sparring between both nations about who to blame because most

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:58.640
 people in the press wants to just take the natural assumption that these zoonotic infections,

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:04.280
 they do occur and it's typically the finger pointing was at the wet market in Wuhan because

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:11.960
 it exists and animals have been known throughout history really to transmit disease to humans.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:19.240
 But this information about the phylogenetic tree of the virus' genome and how it's changed

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:26.240
 over time indicates a historical timeline for it and that it was prior to the outbreak

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:32.360
 here in Wuhan that the sequence originated. So that's very interesting.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:43.880
 A very recent article was published by top rank virologists saying that this particular

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:53.280
 virus was impossible to anticipate and to engineer. So even though that was the intent

00:19:53.280 --> 00:20:03.800
 of the CDC for years was to make a pathogen, these recent virologists say that just the

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:11.800
 nature of this particular one, they can't foresee that anyone could have engineered

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.640
 this one. Okay, I think probably what we want to talk

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:24.880
 about at this point in time is the numbers. Certainly from the alarmist point of view,

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:31.560
 it's gripped everybody's attention. I would say that spectacularly having spectacularly

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:38.880
 gathered everybody's attention in one go, they, I say they, but I won't say they, this

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:46.240
 event has shut down most of the western and the rest of the world in terms of paralyzing

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:55.400
 it both economically and financially. And I guess it's one thing to see or to wonder

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:01.720
 how we're going to come out of this economically and another to speculate that people were

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.320
 shorting the stocks or selling. We've had a couple of examples here of some

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.600
 senators who've sold several million dollars worth of stocks prior to this happening because

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.320
 of the briefing that was given back in late January.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:22.080
 Yeah, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr, the morning before

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:30.320
 he gave a talk and a week before announcing it to the public, he one morning sold 1.7

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:36.520
 billion. Okay, let's briefly mention this doctor's

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:42.720
 name because he's certainly in the news and he's been in the news before in 2010 when

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:49.520
 he basically said the same kind of thing about a previous, I won't call it a pandemic because

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:59.840
 it never did turn out to be a pandemic, but Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, so Wolfgang, W-O-L-F-G-A-N-G,

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:09.880
 Wolfgang, and his last name is Wodarg, W-O-D-A-R-G. Would you like to speak a little bit to Wolfgang,

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:15.280
 his background, or we can get into the statistics that he highlights that at this point in time

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:21.640
 really basically flat out refuse to believe that this is anything exceptional.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:27.240
 And obviously there are links to potential for producing vaccines and all the money that's

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.560
 involved in giving those contracts out and not only that, but to the people that would

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.520
 readily take it up given the scaremongering that's gone on with this.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:44.200
 John Ioannidis is another very well-known professor who has analyzed other statistical

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:54.240
 disease situations and he is suggesting that this might be history's greatest evidence

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.880
 fiasco.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:04.520
 If that happens, though, considering the ruining the economy of the world, no one is going

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:11.240
 to be able to admit that.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:18.760
 There's going to be a great campaign of trying to convince the world that something really

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:28.640
 is happening despite Ioannidis and Wodarg's points that they can't see the evidence because

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:35.440
 they weren't doing the testing in previous years in a way that can be compared.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:46.960
 And the testing, creating many new testing kits, it's very useful and can be used to

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.640
 help to control the virus.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:59.360
 But when you look at its application in China, first it looked like 2.7% of those infected

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.100
 were dying.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:09.040
 But as they produced huge amounts of the test kits and were testing very large numbers of

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:21.120
 people, the mortality rate per infection decreased to 0.6% was the most recent one I saw.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:29.800
 And people like Ioannidis are saying the actual mortality figure from statistically interpreting

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:40.520
 the available information could range from 0.025 up to 5%.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:52.160
 Italy and Iran have been in areas reporting 5 or 8 or 10% mortality of those infected.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:59.640
 But if you look at just the people reporting to hospitals, for example, then 10% wouldn't

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:06.480
 be an unreasonable expectation because the sickest people will be the ones you're measuring.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:15.400
 But as the population expands, for example, in South Korea and China where they measured

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:23.960
 larger numbers of people, the mortality rate ended up closer to 0.6%.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:29.080
 And then of course there's people that might have this species of coronavirus, but they

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.080
 aren't getting tested.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:37.160
 So if everybody, the whole entire population were tested, then that mortality rate would

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.200
 drop to what you're saying, something like 0.025.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.640
 So the mortality rate is very skewed.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.880
 It's not an accurate way to look at this.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:56.480
 It's approaching the normal flu mortality of one in a thousand.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.840
 So Dr. Peate, you're probably just the right person to speak to about statistics, having

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:09.440
 gone through everything that you did back at university and going through just providing

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:16.240
 data and comparing and understanding the way that statistics do get skewed, certainly to

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:22.920
 benefit the editor or the magazine it's being published in.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.960
 Just give us an idea about some of the statistical skewing and then we'll look at the numbers

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:32.640
 of people that they're quoting on various news sources and sites about this particular

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.640
 outbreak.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:41.840
 I've been mentally comparing it to what has happened historically with cancer incidence,

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.120
 mortality, and diagnosis.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:52.680
 I saw a General Electric television advertisement years ago saying that if everyone would buy

00:26:52.680 --> 00:27:04.000
 their x-ray machines, we could increase the cure rate of cancer to close to 100 percent,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.320
 97 percent cure rate, I think they said.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:21.120
 Because if only, say, 40 percent of the population is going to die of cancer, but you diagnose

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:34.000
 it in 100 percent of the population at a certain age, only 1 percent might be dying in that

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.800
 population range.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:46.920
 But if you increase the number that you treat and you're treating people that otherwise

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:53.920
 would never have discovered their cancer, you'll seem to have a high cure rate.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:28:05.960
 Fifty percent of people, 100 percent of people 50 years old and older have somewhere in their

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:10.040
 body tissue that can be diagnosed as cancer.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:17.320
 So if you look hard enough, you can say there's 100 percent cancer incidence.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:22.560
 No, 100 percent of people will die from cancer.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.760
 Yeah, only a smaller percentage die.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:32.600
 So you can claim to have cured it if you find it in those people who never would have developed

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.680
 it.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:42.840
 But when you treat the cancer increasingly as you diagnose it at an earlier age, if your

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:50.360
 treatment is killing people, then the mortality rate will increase with the diagnostic rate.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:58.160
 And starting in 1945, the American Cancer Society publicized that you should regularly

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:04.640
 have a checkup for cancer and watch for the signs.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:11.840
 And steadily, 40 years after that cancer, mortality increased.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:18.720
 In the two or three years after the prostate-specific antigen test became available, the number of

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.960
 diagnoses increased radically.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:29.280
 And since there was no change in the population, the mortality would be expected to stay the

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.280
 same.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:37.240
 But since the treatment went up in proportion to the extreme increase in diagnosis, also

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:44.760
 the mortality suddenly surged up, strongly implying that it was the treatment they were

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.720
 dying of.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:59.760
 And when you look at the people going to the hospitals, a certain proportion of those historically

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:08.400
 in the United States, between 200,000 and 440,000 are being killed by medical mistakes

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.880
 in the hospital.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:17.960
 So even with the doctors being the ones judging what happens to you in the hospital, when

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:28.680
 you use a diagnostic test to herd people to see their doctors and go to the hospital,

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:36.120
 you're for sure going to subject them to this very high rate of medical accidents.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:44.720
 We've always said that the heterogenic drug deaths, the figures are pretty startling in

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.560
 terms of the sheer numbers.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.680
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your AbDoctor on KMEDGalbaville 91.1 FM.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.880
 From now until the end of the show, you're invited to call in the questions about this

00:30:54.880 --> 00:31:01.080
 month's topic on the outbreak of coronavirus and its impact worldwide.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:06.520
 The number is 707-923-3911.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.840
 That's 707-923-3911.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.160
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.920
 My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray, and we're joined by Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:21.640
 Okay, I think we have a caller on the air.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.960
 So let's just take this next caller.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.960
 Caller, you're on the air.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.440
 Where are you from and what's your question?

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.440
 Hello?

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.200
 Caller, I told you to listen on the phone.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.880
 Oh, well, try again.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.160
 Okay, try again.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.240
 I do actually have someone else called in with one for me to ask you about.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:47.040
 Wanted you to talk about the origins of the Spanish flu and theories about that and conspiracies

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.440
 surrounding that.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.200
 Okay, well, before we do that, let's just give out the number again, Michael, and then

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.400
 you can just let me know when we've got more callers lined up here.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.280
 The number is 707-923-3911.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:10.200
 So, Dr. Peat, Spanish flu, 1918, extremely virulent, wiped out, they imagine between

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.520
 50 and 100 million.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:18.040
 They've up right up revised that number from 25 million, but very deadly and not necessarily

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:24.640
 due to the end of the war and, well, obviously the end of the war, but people were sick and

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:34.080
 malnourished, but it was a very virulent form of H1N1 virus that just seemingly had a perfect

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:44.880
 storm of genetic ability to rapidly take over human cells, mammalian cells.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:52.240
 The data, it's a very few actual tissue samples that that's based on compared to the millions

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.240
 of deaths.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.240
 Yeah.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:05.880
 So, at that time, the flu was thought to be a bacterial infection and there was one popular

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:15.520
 treatment for it using camphor, injecting camphor dissolved in oil such as olive oil

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:23.400
 and it turns out that even though they thought it was a bacteria and they believed they were

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:31.880
 curing people with this camphor treatment, about 40 or 50 years ago, someone noticed

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:39.880
 that a distillate of petroleum smelled like camphor and they purified it and added an

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:49.800
 amino group to it to make it water soluble and found that it's an anti-influenza agent.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:59.760
 I think it really grew out of the perception that natural camphor was being used widely

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:09.600
 in the First World War and this drug that was created about 50 years ago, amandadine

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:19.040
 and its relative remandidine and the newer mimantine, which it's most known for treating

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:26.800
 Alzheimer's disease, but these are all broad spectrum antivirals and they happen to be

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:35.480
 safe genetically for many of the antivirals being recommended, especially in the United

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.320
 States recently.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:56.840
 So, acyclovir, ribavirin and chloroquine, I think it is, antimanaril, all of those happen

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:04.200
 to interfere with human DNA and they're recognized as genotoxic.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:11.800
 So if you have many millions of people taking those preventively, you're going to have millions

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:17.240
 of people with genetic damage and you don't want that in the young population.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:23.320
 I know you've spoken to this in the past when we've done various radio shows on viral disease

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:30.280
 and you're not very, I know you really want people to be healthy and you want them to

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.440
 be as healthy as they can be and do it as naturally as possible, but you're really not

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:39.480
 into antivirals as such, are you, in terms of safety treatment?

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:51.240
 These related to camphor, mimantine for example, I think they're safe genetically and they're

00:35:51.240 --> 00:36:01.320
 moderately effective against a wide variety of viruses, but aspirin, if it was under patent,

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:08.280
 it would be considered the super antiviral because it's active against such a variety

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:17.240
 including influenza and herpes and rhinovirus and various hepatitis viruses.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.720
 I just want to hold you there for a moment, Dr. Peay.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:26.840
 We definitely have to make sure we have time for strategies here to mitigate this, but

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.120
 I think we have a caller on the air, so let's take this next caller.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.120
 Caller, you're on the air, where are you from?

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.240
 Yes, hello, am I in the air?

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.240
 Yes, go ahead.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:45.560
 Yeah, well I'm wondering that since the transmission is by droplets rather than aerosol, that are

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:53.080
 coming from the oral or nasal cavity, which could be considered like a point source, similar

00:36:53.080 --> 00:37:02.320
 to a point source in pollution, why isn't, wouldn't you think that mandatory wearing

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:11.840
 of masks when you're around other people would stop the spread in its tracks?

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:21.640
 That does seem reasonable since the aerosol will likely be trapped on a fairly fine porous

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.640
 mask.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:28.000
 And I've always mentioned the regular hand washing as being a number one preventative

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.560
 because most people unfortunately don't even think about it, but they're constantly touching

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:37.000
 their nose, rubbing their eyes, putting their fingers near their mouth, and I think people

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.360
 do it probably a hundred times a day unconsciously, and I think that's as much a...

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:51.520
 Soap is a surefire virus for this type of virus, but that was in the news shortly after

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:59.040
 a man was hospitalized because he ate soap thinking it would be internally, but it's

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:03.440
 not safety, but it's very virus idle on the skin.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:09.200
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Doctor, K. McGarvable, 91.1 FM.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.240
 From now until eight o'clock, you're invited to call in with questions related to this

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:21.040
 month's topic of the coronavirus, and the number is 707-923-3911.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:25.760
 So Michael, is there anybody else here that's waiting at this point in time?

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.400
 Yes, that's what the theme music means.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.400
 You have two calls.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.400
 Okay, okay.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.400
 Yeah, it's difficult to see.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.520
 So, Cora, you're on the air.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.520
 Where are you from, and what's your question?

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:40.400
 Hi, I just had a quick comment, and the question, I'll take my answer off the air.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.000
 So hi, this is me.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.440
 Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:52.240
 My comment is that a few months ago, Dr. Peat mentioned a few times that just forming organizations

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:59.200
 would be the best way to fight whatever negative kind of impact the ruling class is having,

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:05.960
 and I realized that this new concept of social distancing is just a great way to crush all

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.520
 organizations going forward.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:13.640
 I mean, not to sound too conservative, but that's just something interesting I noticed.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:20.200
 And my question is that the governor of California said around half the population is going to

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.200
 get infected with this virus.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.080
 Do you think that's an accurate projection?

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.760
 And I'll take my answer off the air.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.760
 Thank you.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:33.760
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, I guess we should talk about this looking forward, and I guess historically

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.120
 we'll be vindicated by whatever the outcome is.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.120
 But what do you think?

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:43.440
 I mean, he said, Newsom said 50 to 60 million people, or 50 to 60%.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.840
 I think it was 60% of the population he said expected to contract this virus.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:52.440
 I think in this go-around, not just in this general yearly return.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:40:03.280
 I think that's within the historical range that almost none of them will have a serious

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.480
 sickness, but the stuff blows around.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:18.920
 And the reason there's a flu season from winter until late spring is that during, in the temperate

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:29.840
 zones, the sun exposure goes down and most people become to some extent vitamin D deficient

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:34.840
 and extremely susceptible to infection, especially viruses.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:44.720
 And by summer, the vitamin D is rising and viral immunity rises very strongly, ending

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:49.440
 the flu season year after year.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.440
 Interesting.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:56.520
 I just want to speak to that in terms of I have a friend who's using 20,000, okay, so

00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:02.520
 most people would be listening, vitamin D comes in drops and without naming names, there's

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.080
 plenty of people that manufacture it.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:09.520
 But there's one particular manufacturer in Chicago, I think that's where they're based,

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.000
 that produce a vitamin D of 4,000 international units per drop.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.360
 And I don't think the CDC or the other health bodies here in the States recommend anything

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.400
 more than 800 international units or 1,000 international units.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:27.240
 Anyway, this vitamin D product is a 4,000 IU per drop product.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:35.000
 And this particular person has been using 20,000 IU per day, okay, so well over what

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.800
 would normally be recommended.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:41.240
 And they've had labs and blood work to test their vitamin D and their vitamin D is just

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.520
 about in the middle of the range because it was very low to begin with.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:50.440
 And so they started using more and more and more and they had three or four labs done.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:56.240
 And at this point in time, their vitamin D is about 50 pg/ml when the reference is between

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.680
 25 or 30 to 100.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.680
 So how about that?

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.400
 It's such a variance in people.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:06.280
 So people taking your vitamin D, the best way to know whether you're taking enough is with

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:12.520
 a skin prick test and you can get that from the vitamin D council online.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:18.920
 And that way you need to be aware of actually what your level is and Dr. Peat recommends

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.920
 it's not below 50 ng/ml.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:26.520
 50 to 60 is a safe range.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:35.960
 And I've seen probably 95% of the people I've been in contact with have been below that range

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:47.320
 and there are lots of other symptoms that go with low vitamin D. Fatigue, muscle weakness,

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:57.680
 high blood pressure is strongly connected with it and the virus I mentioned that it

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:07.800
 interacts with the endocrine and inflammatory systems and vitamin D and adequate calcium

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:17.280
 in the diet happen to work on the same part of the immune system that the drugs that the

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:27.120
 Chinese have been having success with in treating people who already have the infection.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:32.440
 One drug is cinanserin which is a serotonin blocker.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:43.040
 The other is Losartan, an androtensin receptor blocker, AT1 receptor blocker.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:50.280
 And Losartan has been used for treating high blood pressure mostly.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:59.120
 But it turns out that all of these anti-inflammatory natural substances, a good calcium intake

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:12.600
 in the diet, adequate vitamin D, normal level of progesterone, aspirin and almost everything

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:20.840
 anti-inflammatory that has been studied in relation to this inflammatory system works

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:26.360
 in the same direction as this drug recommended by the Chinese.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:31.720
 So would you recommend that people go see their doctor and ask for a prescription of

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:40.280
 Losartan and Mementine and any other drugs or would you recommend people wait until they

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.280
 get sick to use them?

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.680
 And what is your recommendation?

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:52.160
 A man in Italy about a week ago emailed me about his friend with confirmed coronavirus

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:57.880
 and I mentioned the Chinese recommendations to him.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:02.560
 He rushed out and got a Losartan prescription.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.760
 The next day he said his friend was up and out of bed and feeling good.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:13.880
 And today I got an email from him saying that not just good, he feels like he has new lungs.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:24.360
 I wanted you to outline here, you mentioned that the ACE1 and ACE2, the drugs that block

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:30.160
 that, that the Losartan is one of those drugs isn't it?

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:43.120
 Well, there's a lot of confusion going around because the ACE inhibiting drugs have been

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:52.360
 available for decades, but in just the last 10 or 15 years, a lot of subtle details have

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.120
 been discovered.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:46:05.200
 Some people are saying that since the virus attacks the ACE2 enzyme, that this is the

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:15.200
 receptor so-called for the virus and that this receptor combines with the ACE1 and the

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:19.960
 receptor site to infect the cell and reproduce.

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:29.520
 They say that anything that increases ACE2 enzyme must increase your susceptibility to

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:38.760
 the virus, but it's exactly the opposite because ACE2 is a defensive anti-inflammatory enzyme

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:44.360
 that destroys androtensin, even though it's called androtensin converting enzyme number

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.360
 two.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:53.400
 What it's doing is trimming two amino acids off the end of androtensin molecule, turning

00:46:53.400 --> 00:47:02.040
 it into what they call androtensin one to seven, which is doing the opposite, curing,

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:11.600
 preventing the fibrotic and inflammatory processes that damage your lungs, arteries, bones, heart,

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.840
 nerves, kidneys and so on.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:26.480
 So the things that block the AT1 receptor also increase the ACE2 enzyme, which is protective.

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:39.520
 So as it turns out, in fact, it looks confusing to the old textbook idea that the ACE enzymes

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:44.720
 are simply making the androtensin.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:51.680
 I don't think the show would be complete without mentioning herbs, obviously, given the title

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.680
 of the radio show.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:58.000
 I kind of get lost in a lot of the science and a lot of the science does support a lot

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.800
 of the interactions of herbs and herbal medicines.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:08.720
 I know in Europe for countless, countless years, pneumonia has been present in England

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.240
 and in Ireland and people have died obviously from pneumonia.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.640
 It's very common in the winter.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:22.080
 There are products like pleurisy root, which has been well documented for its antibacterial

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:29.640
 effect for pleurisy and then obviously other material that works to either cause an anti-inflammatory

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.640
 effect.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:39.040
 We did mention the whole point of what they call the cytokine storm in the pneumonic version

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.760
 or the primary kind of pneumonia.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:48.600
 You really want anti-inflammatories and so Echinacea root is definitely an anti-inflammatory

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.320
 rather than the flowers.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:55.640
 The flowers do have an antiviral action, but I think they're probably a little bit too

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.640
 maybe stimulating.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:01.720
 So it's the anti-inflammatories and then I know elderberry has been picked up a lot,

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:08.880
 certainly in the press and on the internet as being beneficial for this particular virus.

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:17.160
 Obviously things like thyme and again the antibacterials that the labiates, the daisy

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:21.360
 family, sorry, the mint family exhibit.

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:27.320
 A lot of those monoterpenes and terpenes there are very positively antibacterial, but I think

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:30.640
 from an inflammatory perspective, that's the main thing is to try and get on top of the

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:35.720
 inflammation and then for secondary infections, those things that would be used as volatile

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:39.520
 oil herbs to control bacterial infection.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:45.840
 Okay, so I know we do have callers on the air here and we want to make sure that the

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:46.840
 callers can get on.

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:50.480
 So let's, and we're probably going to do this next month if we're all still here.

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:53.280
 I'm sure we will be, but let's take this next caller.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.880
 Caller you're on the air, where are you from and what's your question?

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.600
 And we need to be fairly quick.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:01.560
 I am from the San Francisco Bay Area and I'll take this off my phone.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:07.680
 What will it take for our economy to bounce back to where it was before the coronavirus?

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.680
 Well good question.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:11.680
 I know you're not an economist, Dr. Peat.

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:20.280
 What do you think about the potential fallout from the financial meltdown that's going on?

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:28.120
 The government is talking about giving large amounts of money to corporations rather than

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:32.480
 emphasizing getting it directly to the population.

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:42.000
 The extremely conservative economist Milton Friedman decades ago proposed minimum basic

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.840
 income as a way to stabilize.

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:53.640
 He proposed, for example, that it would allow industry to have stayed in the United States

00:50:53.640 --> 00:51:03.960
 instead of going to China and at this point his proposal probably wouldn't do much to

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:11.720
 recover the industry from China, but I think he was on the right track that it's necessary

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:19.000
 to get money to the consumers, not just to the corporations that are losing money.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.040
 If I could jump in for a second, I'm going to be on Bud Rogers' show.

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:27.960
 It's not until the 19th of April, his next, I guess it's the third Sunday of the month,

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:32.080
 1.30, and we'll be talking about modern monetary theory and sort of how that works in because

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:36.280
 the basic guaranteed income is sort of related to that.

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:39.200
 So I know it's a long way away, but people are asking about it.

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:45.360
 I have some interesting facts that I wanted to mention, Dr. Peat.

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.560
 I was looking at the number of deaths.

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:53.200
 After you had told me that there was an average of 44,000 people that die in the United States

00:51:53.200 --> 00:52:01.880
 from flu, and right now when they've done the math, they've extrapolated that about

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:08.280
 10% of those flu cases were caused by the coronavirus in previous years.

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.120
 Now this is a different strain.

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:13.960
 But anyways, if it was going to stick with previous years, it would be about 10% of that

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.440
 44,000 would die from this coronavirus.

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.680
 Am I understanding you correctly, Dr. Peat?

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.680
 Yeah.

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:26.880
 Dr. Vodarg made the same point that he said according to the historical curve using those

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:33.880
 figures, he would have expected, I think he said 2,000 to 2,500 deaths in Germany, where

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.880
 at that point it was 200.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.720
 So they were behind the mortality curve.

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:45.920
 And then I found another database that talks about deaths from pneumonia, which can be

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.400
 pneumonia caused by anything.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:55.280
 So it could be because someone had bacterial infection and older people.

00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:03.320
 So basically there was 85,000 people died in the United States in 2017, and 58,000 of

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.440
 those were 70 plus years old.

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:15.280
 And in China they had in 2017 161,000 and 125,000 of those people were 70 years or older.

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:20.440
 So these deaths are from pneumonia of various causes.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.440
 Yeah.

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:31.280
 Old age causes sepsis and pneumonia as the most common causes of death, other than specific

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.200
 things like heart disease and cancer.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:41.400
 But it happens that old age changes the inflammatory system the same way this particular virus

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:50.160
 does, increasing antitansin receptor and decreasing the protective ACE2 enzyme system.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:57.280
 So anything you're doing to protect against the viral effects really are protecting against

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.920
 aging.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:06.920
 And the main outcome of the pneumonia produced by these viruses is a chronic fibrosis of

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:14.720
 the lungs and all of the things protective against the inflammatory system helped to

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.640
 reverse the fibrosis once it had started.

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:24.200
 So would you recommend people go after a doctor for prescription of Lusartan or would you

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:31.920
 recommend they just wait until they get it, get the virus or get the flu?

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:42.640
 I think it's not such a problem that a person needs to go to the doctor for it.

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:47.680
 Almost everyone is going to have only mild symptoms from it.

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.680
 Right.

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:54.320
 And everyone has access to aspirin and herbs like echinacea and elderberry and astragalus

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:59.200
 and bicol school caps and then also those antihistamines if you do get the flu, loratadine

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:03.320
