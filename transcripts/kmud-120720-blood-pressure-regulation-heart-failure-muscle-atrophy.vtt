 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.760
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.760
 My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.760
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.760
 which run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8pm,

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.760
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.760
 and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.760
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.760
 about a wide range of conditions,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.760
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.760
 which are either grown on our CCOF certified herb farm

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.760
 or which are sourced from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.760
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.760
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.760
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.760
 to this month's subject of blood pressure regulation,

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.760
 heart failure and muscle atrophy amongst others.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.760
 Let's see what else we may or may not get into.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.760
 So the number here if you live in the area is 923 3911

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.760
 or if you live outside the area, the toll free number is 1800 568 3723

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.760
 which is 1800 KMUD RAD.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.760
 We can also be reached toll free on 1 888 WBMERB

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.760
 for further questions during normal business hours Monday through Friday.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.760
 Well, as is becoming a routine, a regular routine here on a third Friday of every month,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.760
 we're very pleased to have Dr. Peat to share his experience and wisdom

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.760
 that is difficult to find somewhere else.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.760
 I'm not sure that we've ever found anybody quite like him.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.760
 So he's been extensively researching many, many different areas of health and nutrition

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.760
 probably for 25, 30 years or more and over 40.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.760
 There you go.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.760
 Okay. Well, tonight we're actually going to start.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.760
 I'm going to first ask Dr. Peat to introduce himself,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.760
 but we're going to start with what he has been certainly educating us in the last three to four years

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.760
 as being an untruth and there's scientific evidence showing in the medical literature now.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.760
 Folks show exactly what he's been saying for quite a long time.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.760
 So, Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us on the show again.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.760
 Hi.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.760
 Okay. For those people who perhaps have never heard the show before, which is totally possible,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.760
 and perhaps for those people who may not know you,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.760
 would you just let the listeners know your professional academic background?

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:50.760
 I studied biology for a Ph.D. at the University of Oregon, 1968 to '72,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:59.760
 and before that had been in various things, linguistics, art,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.760
 taught a variety of health-related courses, psychology, philosophy,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:17.760
 and things that were perspectives on my basic orientation, which is biological,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.760
 but biological in a very broad sense.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:29.760
 My graduate study in biology concentrated on aging of the reproductive system,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.760
 but the reason I went to the graduate school, I was intending to study brain biology

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.760
 because of my previous work in linguistics and psychology.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.760
 I wanted to understand how the brain handled consciousness and language,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:56.760
 but at the university I discovered that the biologists were really no more scientific

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.760
 than the people in the humanities and social sciences.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:08.760
 It was very heavily ideological, so that was why I shifted over to the other end of the organism

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.760
 where I could look at more physical biochemical processes.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.760
 Well, it sounds very well-rounded because the psyche affects biochemistry,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.760
 and biochemistry affects the psyche, right?

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.760
 Yeah.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.760
 Okay, well, the subjects that we wanted to expand on with the research that you've done

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.760
 and the articles that you've written, in fact, this month's newsletter is pretty much based around--

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.760
 rather, the show is pretty much based around your newsletter for this month,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.760
 and the subjects that you had on the newsletter there was basically blood pressure,

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.760
 regulation, muscle atrophy and heart failure in perspective along with edema,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.760
 and one thing that really caught my attention, I know for the longest time--

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.760
 well, all the time that we've been speaking and consulting with you,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.760
 probably three years, maybe four now.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.760
 Over four.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:09.760
 Over four, but just tell me, how many years has it been that you have been purporting

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.760
 that saturated fats are better than polyunsaturates as a first off?

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.760
 I really started thinking intensively about it at the end of the '70s,

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:28.760
 but I ran into the question very directly in the aging research in the reproductive system

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.760
 because way back in the 1930s and '40s,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.760
 people were showing that estrogen accelerated the breakdown of polyunsaturated fats,

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.760
 which intensified the effects of estrogen and accelerated aging,

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.760
 especially in the reproductive tissues.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:59.760
 But it took several years after finishing my dissertation before I got around to really concentrating

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:11.760
 on the nutritional implications of that and emphasizing the benefits of coconut oil around 1978 or '79.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.760
 So way back then, it was already--

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:20.760
 there was already literature showing that the saturated fats, which are coming from animal fats and coconut oil,

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.760
 versus the polyunsaturates, which are the liquid vegetable oils

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.760
 and are now present in pork and chicken fat and fish because of what they're feeding these animals,

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.760
 including the fish, the farm-raised fish.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.760
 And the whole food chain.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.760
 Well, yeah, and then it filters down the whole food chain.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:41.760
 So you're saying back then, all of this research was available for people to view?

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.760
 Yeah, by the 1940s or '50s, the polyunsaturated fats, both fish oil and seed oil,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:57.760
 had been incriminated in intensifying some of the estrogen and age-related diseases.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:07.760
 The Schutt family, who were the first ones to popularize the therapeutic use of vitamin E,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:14.760
 started out with it preventing blood clots related to high estrogen,

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:26.760
 and that overlaps with the estrogen activating the breakdown production of free radicals from the polyunsaturated fats

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.760
 and causing vascular disease and so on.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:37.760
 So vitamin E was a fertility drug and an anti-estrogen nutrient,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.760
 as well as a protection against the polyunsaturated fats.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:49.760
 So lots of people consider vitamin E to be an antioxidant to help protect us against free radicals,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.760
 but you're saying that a free radical-producing substance is this vegetable oil,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:00.760
 this liquid oils and the fish oils and the other liquid vegetables apart from olive oil?

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:08.760
 Yeah, in the 1940s, before that antioxidant concept was introduced,

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.760
 vitamin E was being thought of as an anti-estrogen,

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:21.760
 but in 1942, the estrogen industry basically took over the FDA and public consciousness

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:30.760
 and suppressed everything that incriminated estrogen in aging, miscarriage and so on.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:38.760
 And so since vitamin E was, by the Schutt family and others, identified as an anti-estrogen,

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:48.760
 the estrogen industry shifted the emphasis to protection against free radical oxidation.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:58.760
 And there was very quickly an awareness that there was an inverse relationship

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.760
 between the polyunsaturated fats and vitamin E.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.760
 If you increased your vitamin E greatly,

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:13.760
 you could prevent damage from either estrogen or polyunsaturated fats.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.760
 But with aging and the accumulation in the body,

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:26.760
 you had to increase the amount of vitamin E to prevent miscarriage, for example.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:38.760
 My thesis advisor, Arnold Soderwall, did experiments in which he showed that you could prevent middle-aged infertility

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:45.760
 just by increasing the amount of vitamin E in the animal's diet progressively

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:56.760
 and extrapolating to human levels, it would be the equivalent of 400 units of vitamin E per day

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.760
 by the age of about 45 to maintain fertility.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:08.760
 But that amount increases if you increase the amount of polyunsaturated fat in the diet.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:16.760
 If you carefully avoid the polyunsaturated fats, your requirement for vitamin E is very low.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.760
 It creeps up gradually with aging.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:24.760
 So then maybe the dietary amount that you can get from the foods you eat would be enough.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.760
 Yeah.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.760
 But with increasing polyunsaturated fats in the American and all over the world diet,

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.760
 the need for vitamin E has gone up.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.760
 Yeah.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.760
 And it very quickly reaches the point where you can no longer stop the free radical production

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.760
 just by increasing the vitamin E.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.760
 Okay.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:49.760
 Well, the main reason I started the conversation towards this direction is because there were two articles.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.760
 One was published by the... and I could kick myself for not having them.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.760
 I thought I had a laptop with me.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.760
 Anyway, I'm sure you probably know about them, Dr. Peat.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.760
 But if you could remember any more than I did from reading them,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:10.760
 there was basically a 2009 and a 2011 peer-review article which published data conclusively proving

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:16.760
 that saturated fat intake improved mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.760
 And this is one of the first direct references to seeing that saturated fats...

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.760
 Oh, and it was also in reference improved mortality and morbidity compared to PUFA,

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.760
 which is the polyunsaturates.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:35.760
 So this was another direct piece of evidence to show that the scientific community at least

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:42.760
 are getting this point across and hopefully the medical community will start taking notice of it as time goes on.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:51.760
 Yeah, that 2011 study was by Gal Vow and others, T.F. Gal Vow.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.760
 And did you have anything more to say than I remembered from the article without having it in front of me

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.760
 about the morbidity and mortality improvements?

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:14.760
 Just that a high intake of saturated fat improves survival, while a high intake of polyunsaturated fat impairs survival.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.760
 And how do the triglycerides affect the level of triglycerides in your blood?

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.760
 How does this affect the...

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:26.760
 According to Horwich and others, the 2009 study,

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:33.760
 there have been several studies that show that a higher level of lipoproteins,

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:41.760
 total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density, and triglycerides

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:47.760
 are all associated with improved survival in heart failure patients.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.760
 Right. So a higher cholesterol is directly responsible for an improved outcome.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.760
 So that's pretty staggering as far as I'm concerned because the medical community at large

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:03.760
 are telling people not to consume saturated animal fats because it raises cholesterol

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.760
 and cholesterol is bad for you.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.760
 And you've been talking about this for years and years and years,

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.760
 and we've only heard from you for the last three or four years.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.760
 And we've been trying to get this aired to people that will listen to it,

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.760
 who don't just disregard it out of hand without recognizing the science behind it.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:26.760
 And here we have one medical university in Los Angeles and another medical university--

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.760
 I forget where that one was--but peer-published reviews showing the improved outcome.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.760
 So that's pretty significant.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.760
 So why did it get so back to front?

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:41.760
 Well, I think that's just a general weight of pressure from the industry, and it's just not a--

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:49.760
 Yeah, the seed oil industry created that myth because they found that eating a lot of seed oil

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:56.760
 can lower your cholesterol, and since you have cholesterol in atherosclerotic arteries,

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:02.760
 they said it must be causing the atherosclerosis.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:09.760
 That was never demonstrated, and in fact it protects you against atherosclerosis, among other things.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:15.760
 And wasn't it the Japanese who came up with an article showing--or another--

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:23.760
 Yeah, that there's polyunsaturated fat in the plaques in the old deteriorated arteries.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:29.760
 Oxidized omega-3 and omega-6, so that's underneath the cholesterol bandage,

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.760
 and the cholesterol bandage is trying to stop that rapid rate of oxidation.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:40.760
 Yeah, and the pigment is the product of breakdown of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:49.760
 So we can look at cholesterol as an antioxidant. It's slowing down that rapid oxidation of free radical damage to our arteries.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.760
 The cholesterol is actually bandaging that up and acting as an antioxidant.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:16:01.760
 That was demonstrated and published already in a major medical textbook in 1922.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.760
 1922! That's just when the--

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:12.760
 This is where you get that saying that you quoted before now, that a lie spreads around the world quicker than truth can get our shoelaces tied.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.760
 Well, if you put millions of dollars in advertising and bribes.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.760
 Yeah, yeah. Well, you know what? There is actually a caller on the line,

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.760
 and although we don't generally take callers until 7.30 in the show, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer,

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:31.760
 but if any other callers could hang on until 7.30. Let's take this first caller and see what's--

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.760
 You're on the air?

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.760
 Hello, and thank you very much for taking my call.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:49.760
 I'm 68, very active, and I've been eating yogurt and fruit and fresh vegetables with olive oil now for about six months.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:56.760
 There is a lot of stroke and heart failure in my family tree.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:09.760
 My doctor recently prescribed a blood pressure medicine that makes me unactive, unenergetic,

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:20.760
 and for the past two weeks I've been taking a tablespoon of chia seeds into my diet, which is very strictly kept.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:25.760
 And they do, in fact, give me energy, and I chew them really well.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:42.760
 I'm wondering what is the doctor's opinion of my counteracting the blood pressure medicine with chia seeds.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.760
 I couldn't hear what the substances were.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:50.760
 Chia seeds? And you didn't mention the name of the blood pressure drug, but--

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:56.760
 Almadopine.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.760
 Almadopine.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:11.760
 Did they say that that was to lower or inhibit the anthotensin converting enzyme?

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:20.760
 That's the one heart drug that I think is probably beneficial.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:29.760
 It lowers inflammation, if it's the one I'm thinking of, but I don't know the brand names of them.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.760
 So her question is, do you think that--

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:42.760
 What do you think about the way she's been feeling with the chia seeds helping re-energize her after she started taking this blood pressure drug that is making her lethargic?

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:49.760
 Oh, I don't know of anything in the chia seeds that would be beneficial.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.760
 I mean, they're seeds.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.760
 I don't know if they're very high in oil, but they're very mucilaginous.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:03.760
 When I've tried them, they're very mucilaginous, and they could be acting as a laxative to your bowels.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.760
 Have your bowel movements improved?

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.760
 They were never any better.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.760
 Well, I'm not sure. I know it's traditionally been used to be an energizer.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:21.760
 I'm not sure exactly what compound in it that has been reported to be energizing.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:34.760
 If it works as a bulk laxative, it would make you feel better by lowering bacterial endotoxins.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.760
 Okay. Well, I don't know if that's--

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.760
 Thank you so very, very much. I'm going to go back to the radio where it's easier to hear.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.760
 Okay.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.760
 Thank you for your comment.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.760
 You're welcome. Thank you for your call.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.760
 Okay. So you're listening to Ask Your Arab Doctor on KMU DeGarboville, 91.1 FM,

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.760
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.760
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:03.760
 of blood pressure regulation, heart failure, and muscle atrophy, so muscle weakening and wasting.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:09.760
 Now, I know, Dr. Peat, you did quite a lot of personal research on aging as a process

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.760
 and have come across many different things that are anti-aging in their own right

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:21.760
 or anti-inflammatory or energy-producing in terms of increasing cellular respiration

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.760
 and thyroid hormone being one of those things.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:33.760
 In terms of heart failure, and I think just to go back to the articles or the reference articles

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.760
 that were published about the saturated fats and the improvement in outcome

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.760
 of people with heart failure and higher cholesterol being more beneficial

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.760
 and higher triglycerides being more beneficial,

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.760
 and this being completely counter what we've normally been told for whatever reasons,

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:56.760
 the link to heart failure and these fats, the saturated fats,

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.760
 and why it is that they're actually protective and why cholesterol is actually very protective

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.760
 and not something you want to avoid, but actually something you want to make sure

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:09.760
 your cholesterol is reasonably high and a 180, 190 cholesterol is actually not a problem.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.760
 And you've always said that for elderly people, not that elderly, but 50 plus,

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.760
 you want to have a cholesterol that's about 200, and even if it was over that,

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:26.760
 between 200 and 220 is actually not a problem, whereas the medical community

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.760
 wants to put you on statin drugs, and now many of these have been recalled

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:36.760
 for being precluding to other disease.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:43.760
 What's your take on the saturated fats in terms of their either anti-inflammatory effect

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.760
 or their heart protective effect?

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.760
 I think it's all one thing for all of the systems.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:22:02.760
 The saturated fats tend to inhibit the stress hormones which produce a shift to fat metabolism

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:07.760
 away from sugar metabolism by liberating fats from storage.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:12.760
 Once you get too much of the polyunsaturated fats in your body,

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:18.760
 a little stress tends to become a big stress because that type of fat

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:24.760
 intensifies the stress hormones, creating a vicious circle.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:33.760
 The saturated fats turn off the inflammation rather than amplifying it, and that applies.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:40.760
 There was a Hindu who about 30 years ago, maybe 35,

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:50.760
 noticed that alcoholics in the Indian regions that use a lot of butter didn't get liver disease.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:59.760
 So he did the animal experiments and found that butter or other saturated fats protect the liver.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.760
 There have been a lot of studies since then published in the U.S.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:12.760
 that even large amounts of alcohol don't hurt the liver if a person is getting saturated fats.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:20.760
 But if they get any of the polyunsaturated fats, their hepatitis flares up and cirrhosis.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.760
 The same with cancer.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:29.760
 If you look at the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fats in the body,

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.760
 they call it the saturation index.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:41.760
 The more saturated your fats are, the less susceptible you are to developing cancer.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:50.760
 So fibrotic, inflammatory, and tumor diseases, as well as heart failure

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:59.760
 and blood clotting diseases are all closely associated with the polyunsaturated fats

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.760
 and so protected against by the saturated ones.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.760
 So these polyunsaturates really interfere with energy production.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:13.760
 I know when you just mentioned to that caller that if somebody took a bulk laxative,

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.760
 they would feel better because of lowering endotoxin in the gut.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.760
 That's another thing that severely interferes with energy production in our body.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:27.760
 So can you tell us a little bit about endotoxin and how that poisons us

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:36.760
 and what foods we should avoid in order to not support the growth of those bacteria that produce the endotoxin?

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:43.760
 The endotoxin, one of the first things that it triggers is nitric oxide,

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:52.760
 which is a vasodilator, and both nitric oxide and endotoxin increase the production of serotonin.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:25:00.760
 And all of these, besides inhibiting the production of energy using oxygen

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:09.760
 and shifting it over to lactic acid production, all of these increase the leakiness of blood vessels.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:19.760
 And if you simply turn off the supply of sugar, in diabetes, for example, you can't metabolize sugar.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.760
 In starvation, you don't get the sugar in your diet.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:30.760
 In hypothyroidism, you are under stress,

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:36.760
 and so you're shifting over to liberating fats and burning fats instead of sugar.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:46.760
 So anything that impairs energy production, whether it's the toxins starting with endotoxin, nitric oxide and serotonin,

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:54.760
 or if it's the actual environmental interference with your production of energy and supply of energy,

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.760
 all of these make your blood vessels leaky.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:04.760
 All of them raise free fatty acids, which interfere with the use of oxygen,

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:14.760
 and the free fatty acids lead to a whole cascade of inflammatory mediators, especially prostaglandins.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:23.760
 And the prostaglandins in turn interact, making more nitric oxide and other inflammatory things.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:30.760
 So once you get loaded up with the polyunsaturated fats, all of these things tend to interact.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:38.760
 The fats lower your thyroid function and increase your estrogen production,

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:48.760
 both of which intensify the inflammation, leakiness, and loss of energy production.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:57.760
 So other things that can influence the intestinal health and the dilation of these blood vessels in the intestine

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:03.760
 are things like starchy carbohydrates that feed the bacteria that produces endotoxin.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:13.760
 And those things can be, you know, you can mitigate the bacteria from feeding on the starches by not eating them.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.760
 That's the best thing.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:23.760
 And Dr. Peate, you also recommend carrots and bamboo shoots because they're like antibacterial fibers that the bacteria can't seem to feed on.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:36.760
 Yeah, it's extremely rare for a person to have microorganisms that can survive a good supply of either carrots or bamboo fiber.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:43.760
 Certain organisms can adapt to live on them, but it's very rare.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:56.760
 And also herbs like golden seal and cascara bark, those herbs can decrease the number of bacteria in there that are wreaking havoc and producing a lot of endotoxin

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.760
 and therefore then help you protect your liver.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:07.760
 And actually the saturated fats, that's one of the direct effects. They're antibacterial.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:12.760
 Yeah, coconut oil is antimicrobial. It's antibacterial.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:18.760
 Nothing grows in it. It just sits there for ages and doesn't change.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.760
 Now what about the other thing that interferes with energy production?

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:30.760
 You were writing in your last newsletter about the substitution of iron for copper in the respiratory enzyme.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:37.760
 So is this with a copper deficiency and an iron overload? Is that how this is seen?

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:47.760
 Yeah, just the diet can affect it, but stress tends to intensify it.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:29:02.760
 Not getting enough light, anything that stresses your energy production system, such as high estrogen or nitric oxide or low thyroid or too much darkness,

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:09.760
 will tend to make you lose copper from your respiratory system.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:20.760
 And as copper gets lost, iron just tends to fill in for it, binding to some of the same enzymes.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:34.760
 I know shellfish are a rich source of copper, but with the current situation with our Pacific Ocean having Japanese debris wash up on the shores,

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:38.760
 what would you recommend? A good source of copper?

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:43.760
 Liver. Just beef liver, calf liver.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.760
 Buffalo liver?

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:53.760
 Yeah. It has a lot of iron too, but the copper tends to concentrate in the liver.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:30:02.760
 So the place that copper occupies in the respiratory enzyme that you're mentioning has a greater affinity for copper than it does for iron.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.760
 So if you have an adequate supply of copper, then it will get picked up?

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.760
 Yeah.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:15.760
 Because iron, there's lots of things being written about iron, how destructive it is, how readily it reacts.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:20.760
 That being its main problem is that it's very reactive in the body.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.760
 It's another oxidant.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:41.760
 Yeah, and taking a supplement of a free metal, iron, zinc, or copper in the form of a free metal, it can interact with nutrients in your digestive system and oxidize them.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.760
 But iron is the worst one to take as a supplement.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:55.760
 And another thing for our listeners to avoid is cooking acidic products in cast iron pans or making soups in cast iron stockpots,

00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:03.760
 because you will be dissolving that iron when you're cooking them.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:18.760
 So Dr. Peat, can you tell us some more about what else can interfere with the thyroid hormone and how this can affect heart failure and high blood pressure?

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:30.760
 The polyunsaturated fats and stress are probably the most common things throughout Western diet culture.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:44.760
 But traditionally, the cabbage family and beans were the main goitrogens, things that interfere with formation of the thyroid hormone.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:32:00.760
 And in the Andes and parts of southern Mexico and Western China, there's still a tremendous amount of thyroid deficiency and cretinism.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:22.760
 I've read that there are, I think it was 100 million cretins in Western China, and beans are a major factor in the Andes and Mexico and I think in China too, besides some actual iodine deficiency.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:37.760
 But the cabbage family, especially if they aren't cooked well, so the coleslaw, if a person ate coleslaw every day, they would very likely have a thyroid problem.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:43.760
 And what about poor protein intake? Does that influence the thyroid hormone?

00:32:43.760 --> 00:33:01.760
 Yeah, in the 1940s, studies were done showing that they saw that people in the concentration camps, men who came out and started eating well, would often grow breasts.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:21.760
 And they saw that starvation for protein in particular causes the liver to become unable to destroy estrogen and thyroid is needed to inactivate estrogen.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:34.760
 And if you're getting low calories, but especially low thyroid, you turn your metabolism down so that you don't eat up the proteins in your muscles so fast.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:43.760
 So just a fairly slight protein deficiency will cause your thyroid to slow down defensively.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:50.760
 And that means that your liver is leaving more estrogen in circulation.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:34:00.760
 And then estrogen blocks the enzymes which attach iodine to the protein to make the thyroid hormone.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:14.760
 So just stress or a protein deficiency will let estrogen rise and the rising estrogen will block the secretion from your thyroid, creating a vicious circle.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:21.760
 But then when they came out and started eating well, their livers were damaged so severely that their estrogen was really high.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:38.760
 Yeah, and animal studies showed that vitamins B1 and B2 as well as protein were the main things that activate the liver to inactivate estrogen.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.760
 And one of the best sources for B vitamins is liver, is that correct?

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.760
 Yeah.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:52.760
 Okay, good. Well, I just want to let people know that this is 7.30, it's gone now, but you're listening to Ask Your Rev. Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:35:02.760
 So if anyone in the area would like to call about this month's subjects of blood pressure regulation, heart failure and muscle atrophy, which we'll get into a little bit later.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.760
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:19.760
 If you live outside the area, toll free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD. And Dr. Raymond Peat is joining us on the show here to impart his wisdom and we'll be giving out his contact details towards the end of the show.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:35.760
 So another question I have for you Dr. Peat is how does salt restriction adversely affect pregnancy, toxemia with high blood pressure and high blood pressure in general for the normal population, unpregnant population?

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:42.760
 I think we might want to keep that call actually. Sorry, Sarah, we might want to keep that question until we've listened to the callers because there are actually a couple of callers coming now.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.760
 So let's take this first caller. Hold that thought, Sarah. That's a good question.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.760
 Hello?

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.760
 Yeah, you're on the air.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:54.760
 Hi, thank you so much. I was wondering what the doctor thinks about a regimen of Simvastatin 80 mg for the past three years.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:05.760
 I had a heart attack four years ago and I've been prescribed Simvastatin for cholesterol control and 80 mg for the past three years. What's the downside of that?

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.760
 Okay, Dr. Peat, did you hear that?

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.760
 Not exactly.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:18.760
 Okay, the caller was asking what the downside of an 80 mg dose of Simvastatin that he's been on for three years prior to, I think he said he had a heart attack.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.760
 Four years ago.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:29.760
 Four years ago, there you go. He wants to know what the downside to the Simvastatins are. We've heard lots of bad press about the statins but he obviously wants to know your opinion.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:43.760
 It depends on how much it interferes with cholesterol synthesis but one of the side effects that turns up is because when you interfere with cholesterol synthesis,

00:36:43.760 --> 00:37:07.760
 you're also interfering with some other very essential things such as the synthesis of coenzyme Q10 and other regulatory things and that can cause muscle problems because coenzyme Q10 is needed for producing energy.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:12.760
 If the caller is still there, do you know what your cholesterol is at this point?

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:18.760
 Yes, it's come down quite a lot. It's like 49 is the HDL and 46 is the LDL.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.760
 Do you know what the total is?

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.760
 I think it's 147.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.760
 Yeah, that's pretty low.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.760
 That's very low. I've got down very low.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.760
 How old are you?

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.760
 Fifty-three to four.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:43.760
 Okay, Dr. Peat, maybe you'd like to answer that question about what a total cholesterol of 154 would be to that caller and perhaps some of the research that's come out showing that high cholesterol is actually a lot better for people.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:52.760
 I think also in light of the gentleman's previous heart attack, perhaps the ways of avoiding that in terms of what we've been discussing.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:38:01.760
 How long can I stay on Simvastatin? Is that going to take its effect on me over 10 years or five years?

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:05.760
 Do you know what your cholesterol was before you had the heart attack?

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:11.760
 I really don't know. It wasn't that high, but it was at the high end of normal.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.760
 Okay, Dr. Peat.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:22.760
 I doubt that there was any connection at all between the cholesterol and the heart attack if it was in the normal range.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:30.760
 You might actually not have had enough protective effect from cholesterol.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:42.760
 It depends on what your exposure was because cholesterol can protect you from heavy metal poisoning, many kinds of poisoning.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:50.760
 I've heard of this cholesterol protective. I'll look into that.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:39:04.760
 On Dr. Peat's website at the end of the show, we'll give out the address, but there are several articles specifically on cholesterol and their relation, their cardioprotective effects, and they're basically their anti-inflammatory health effects.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:20.760
 As I said at the very beginning of the show when we opened up this month's topic with Dr. Peat, there are two articles that came out, both scientific peer-reviewed scientific literature, one from the University of Los Angeles, and the other was, I forget the institution that provided it,

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:27.760
 demonstrating clearly that cholesterol was actually beneficial in the outcome of heart failure patients.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:34.760
 Just to show what Dr. Peat's been saying for a long time has actually been brought to bear.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.760
 That's what I've heard, but I thank you so much.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.760
 You're very welcome.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.760
 Thank you.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.760
 Thank you for your call.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.760
 Okay, I think there's another call on.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.760
 We had a shy person, and I'm reading their simple question.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:57.760
 She had atrophy, or maybe her friend had atrophy related to a pinched nerve in the neck and was curious about any dietary information that might be able to help atrophy related to a pinched nerve.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.760
 Okay, Dr. Peat, any --

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:08.760
 Yeah, there are several things that could hormonally and nutritionally relate to a pinched nerve.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:21.760
 One of the most common situations of nerve pinching has to do with swelling of the sheath or membrane around the nerve.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:43.760
 It swells up so much, for example, in a thyroid deficiency or estrogen excess that the water makes this sheath compress the nerve so that even without much external pressure or irritation,

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:51.760
 the nerve starts being damaged by the waterlogged condition of its environment.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:41:04.760
 And if it's in a neck joint where your cartilage might be softened because of hypothyroidism,

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:17.760
 which tends to cause waterlogging of the cartilage and causes it to be over-compressible so that the structure of the disc, for example,

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:31.760
 can compress under the weight of your head and upper body, causing the disc to spread out and push on your spinal cord and nerves.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:38.760
 But all of the connective tissues tend to swell up with high estrogen or low thyroid,

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:47.760
 and so you want to check your hormones whenever there's a nerve pressure pinching problem.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:42:09.760
 In dogs and horses, many years ago, they saw that dogs and horses both suffered spinal nerve compression and paralysis of the rear legs was a common result from a compression of the spinal cord.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:25.760
 They found that a copper deficiency was responsible, and keeping horses indoors, eating dry hay was considered responsible for the copper deficiency.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:35.760
 But the absence of light is one of the things that makes your respiratory enzymes lose its necessary copper.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:45.760
 So the combination of darkness and possibly a copper deficiency in the diet will cause an energy failure,

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:52.760
 leading to a swelling of the connective tissues, leading to pinching of the nerves.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.760
 Excellent.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:43:04.760
 So going back to liver, good quality grass-fed organic calves or beef liver or buffalo liver, that's a good source of copper.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.760
 Yes, and it's important to check your thyroid.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:21.760
 The medical community for 30 years now has been relying on the TSH measurement as an indicator of hypothyroidism,

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:35.760
 but they don't like to see the TSH get very low, but TSH is in itself the cause of many of the symptoms blamed on low thyroid.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:52.760
 It's partly the lack of the respiratory effect of the thyroid hormone, but when your hormone is low, the TSH is high, and the TSH has pro-inflammatory actions that,

00:43:52.760 --> 00:44:01.760
 for example, increase the fibrinogen in your blood, making your blood harder to circulate, more viscous.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.760
 And more easily clotted.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.760
 Yes.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:18.760
 So it's really best for your circulatory system and nervous system and so on to have your TSH at least at the low end of normal,

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:28.760
 which according to the American Academy of Clinical Endocrinologists is 0.3 to 3.0.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:38.760
 But one study found that a population that had TSH below 0.4 had the lowest incidence of thyroid cancer.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:50.760
 And so somewhere between 0.0 to 0.4 would be the safe range probably.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:55.760
 Because if you have enough thyroid hormones circulating, then there shouldn't be a high level of TSH.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.760
 Yes.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.760
 And that can be a little bit confusing for patients sometimes.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.760
 Okay.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.760
 Sarah, the question that you had just prior.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.760
 Right.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:13.760
 So I wanted to talk about salt and how this affects water retention and heart failure, swelling of the heart and heart failure, and pregnancy toxemia.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:20.760
 Maybe I should ask you one question at a time, Dr. Beat, but I think they're all linked to a salt deficiency.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.760
 And scientific studies have shown that.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:37.760
 If you just inject a fairly concentrated salt solution, you can see that it directly reduces the leakiness of blood vessels.

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:50.760
 But once anything such as starvation or high estrogen or whatever starts the leakiness problem of your capillaries,

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:55.760
 sodium tends to be the first thing that you lose.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:10.760
 Estrogen is a major factor in causing the retention of water and the loss of sodium so that your tissues, the fluids, become hypotonic

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:19.760
 and they tend to force water into your cells rather than drawing water out as it's produced.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.760
 And this is common with PMS.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:30.760
 When the estrogen rises for ladies, a lot of women experience increased swelling and bloating around this time.

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.760
 Yeah.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:41.760
 And the toxemia symptoms of pregnancy are essentially the same as PMS symptoms.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:50.760
 And surprisingly, menopause involves many of the same symptoms as premenstrual syndrome.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:47:01.760
 And that's one of the great mystifications created by the estrogen industry is that all of these bad symptoms, they say,

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.760
 are caused by a deficiency of estrogen.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:17.760
 But in fact, you see the effects on the circulatory system, high blood pressure, leakiness, a tendency to form aneurysms

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:26.760
 and to have the aneurysms rupture and cause bleeding, the spontaneous hemorrhaging.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:36.760
 All of these tend to associate with the time of menstruation at the end of the premenstrual time when the progesterone falls,

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.760
 leaving unopposed estrogen.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:49.760
 And in toxemic pregnancies, when the woman isn't getting good nutrition, especially not enough protein and salt,

00:47:49.760 --> 00:48:01.760
 and in menopause, but the menopause in particular has been characterized as a time of estrogen deficiency.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:11.760
 But if you look at all of the events of menopause, the health failures of the various systems,

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:19.760
 they're all identical to these other times of estrogen excess.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.760
 And that's why they had to stop that HRT trial.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:30.760
 About 10 years ago, they stopped a trial because too many women were getting heart attacks because of the high estrogen and strokes.

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.760
 And Alzheimer's disease.

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:37.760
 And so for a while, their doctors were not recommending HRT and they wanted women to come off of it.

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.760
 But somehow I'm now seeing women that are back on HRT.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.760
 And I don't know how it just got switched around in less than 10 years.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.760
 But we do have a caller on the line.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.760
 [phone ringing]

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:49.760
 Oh, we don't have a caller on the line.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.760
 They hung up.

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.760
 Okay, that caller was there.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:53.760
 They'd like to call back.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.760
 That's just fine.

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:55.760
 So, Sarah, you're --

00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:09.760
 So how does salt play a part in helping relieve this edema and excessive leak of water from the blood into the tissues, the surrounding tissues?

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:16.760
 So it's a loss of fluid from the blood that leaks into the surrounding tissues and causes a puffy feeling appearance.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:30.760
 It has some direct effects on the mitochondria, increasing energy production and shifting the balance of the cell in the right direction to produce more carbon dioxide.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:46.760
 And working with the carbon dioxide, it's very close to thyroid's effect in regulating its own concentration in the body.

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:54.760
 It increases carbon dioxide, and the carbon dioxide helps to retain as much sodium as you need.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:50:07.760
 Without the sodium or thyroid, you tend to produce more lactic acid, displacing the carbon dioxide, causing inflammation and water retention.

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:21.760
 So the -- many doctors will just insist that the more salt you eat, the more water you will retain and the higher your blood pressure will be.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:46.760
 But David McConnell, I think his name was, was the first medical person to point out that it's a calcium deficiency rather than a sodium excess that accounts for so much of the high blood pressure related to nutrition.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:59.760
 So they had it right in the 50s and before in the wars that were conducted in the deserts and the hot places, maybe in North Africa, that they used to give the troops salt tablets.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:10.760
 So it wasn't unknown. It was pretty popular, I think, in India when the troops were in -- the British troops were in India colonizing it and also in the North African wars.

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:17.760
 I remember my stepfather telling me about the salt tablets they used to get. That's been very common and normal.

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:30.760
 One of the interesting effects of increasing your sodium intake is that it tends to stabilize your blood sugar, partly because it works with thyroid to improve energy efficiency.

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:53.760
 But it lowers adrenaline and that makes your whole system work more efficiently. And it prevents hyperventilation, which is another way that people tend to lose carbon dioxide and shift over to lactic acid.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:52:03.760
 It's also a good thing to take if you have a performance or a show and you're a little bit nervous about it. If you drink some orange juice with a little salt in it, that's also good for dehydration.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:10.760
 But if you have that right before your show, it can really lower adrenaline so you're a little more calm and more relaxed for your show.

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.760
 But we do have another caller on the line and this will probably have to be our last caller.

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.760
 Hi, how are you doing?

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.760
 You're on the air.

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.760
 Great show, great show.

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:24.760
 Hey, I was just wondering, do you happen to know of an herbal supplement for isosorbide?

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.760
 Isosorbide?

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.760
 Isosorbide, yeah.

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:29.760
 I've never heard of it.

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.760
 It's a time-release nitroglycerin for my heart.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:38.760
 Okay, nitroglycerin. There's nothing that's an herbal nitroglycerin.

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:43.760
 Dr. Peat, do you want to talk about nitroglycerin to this client?

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:53.760
 Well, it increases your nitric oxide, which is an age-accelerating free radical.

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.760
 That's the worst thing about it.

00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:02.760
 As far as herbs for the heart, there's lots of herbs that are helpful for the heart, like hawthorn.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:07.760
 Right. Okay, I was just wondering specifically about isosorbide.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.760
 Sorry, I can't help you there.

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:10.760
 Okay, thanks a lot. Great show, guys.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:11.760
 Thanks for your caller.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.760
 Thanks for calling.

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.760
 Okay, Dr. Peat, that's an interesting question.

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:20.760
 I know it's not a very simple one-off question,

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:28.760
 but the whole point of coronary artery occlusion or blockage that the medical fraternity will put down to cholesterol,

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:36.760
 the main way that people can help themselves not to get blocked arteries from their diet,

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.760
 just say a few quick words about it.

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:47.760
 Eating enough calcium, interestingly, is protective of the circulatory system

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:52.760
 and prevents hardening of the arteries with calcium accumulation

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:58.760
 because the parathyroid hormone rises when you don't eat enough calcium or eat too much phosphorus.

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:07.760
 Beans, wheat germ, and meat are very high in phosphorus and low in calcium.

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:14.760
 And vitamin K is very powerful at preventing calcification of the arteries.

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:21.760
 Vitamin K is very high in nettle, herb, and kale, and liver is also a very good source of vitamin K.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.760
 Okay, we do actually have one more call, Dr. Peat.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.760
 Sorry to cut in there, but we've got one more caller.

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.760
 I'm squeezing the quick question in.

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:33.760
 A newly diagnosed diabetic would like some nutrient and dietary and herbal advice.

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.760
 Just quick off the cuff.

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:35.760
 Okay.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.760
 Do we know how old they are?

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:47.760
 A couple of my articles on the website explain why you shouldn't be panicked into avoiding sugar.

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:54.760
 Polyunsaturated fats are the best documented cause of diabetes.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:55:03.760
 So avoiding all those liquid vegetable oils, oily fish, pork fat, chicken fat, turkey, any poultry fat.

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.760
 Switching your diet to saturated sources.

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:09.760
 Saturated fat, butter, coconut oil, beef, lamb fat.

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:17.760
 Okay, so the whole diabetes thing, I know we've talked about this in previous shows, but we're not going to get the time for this round.

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:25.760
 And how it works is, just real quick, is the polyunsaturated fats poison the pancreatic beta cells from producing insulin.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:31.760
 So eventually, once those are removed, then your pancreatic beta cells can recover and start producing insulin again.

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:35.760
 And glucose stimulates the regeneration of the beta cells.

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:40.760
 And so the thing they tell you not to do, glucose, is what you need.

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:41.760
 Is what you need.

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.760
 So read those articles on Dr. Peat's website.

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.760
 They're very, very informative.

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:50.760
 And they've done clinical trials where they have actually seen pancreatic beta cells come back.

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:54.760
 It's not as though they're not there and it's not as though they've all been destroyed.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.760
 So Dr. Peat's website.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:58.760
 Right, let's give out Dr. Peat's website.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:55:59.760
 It's all about Dr. Peat, folks.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.760
 So make sure you go and read his articles.

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.760
 They should turn your life around.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.760
 I know they've definitely made a huge difference to us and the people that we see.

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:14.760
 Okay, so Dr. Peat's website is www.raypeat.com.

00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:18.760
 And on the homepage there, there's a link to the articles.

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:27.760
 There's probably 30 or 40 articles, most of which are sort of 10 pages long with 3 or 4 pages of scientific references to them.

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.760
 So it's very well written.

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:35.760
 And whilst it may be a little difficult to understand if you don't have a particularly scientific mind,

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:41.760
 if you folks out there have heard the radio show and you've got a particular condition that you think may be there,

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:44.760
 go take a look because there's certainly the information that you'll need.

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:47.760
 And if you can't at least understand it, maybe someone else can help you understand it.

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.760
 Well, there's always things that everyone can understand about the different foods

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:55.760
 and the different supplements that can help you, the different nutrients, micronutrients, macronutrients,

00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:59.760
 that can help you recover from whatever it is you're suffering from.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:02.760
 Dr. Peat, do you have anything else to say before we--

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.760
 We've got three minutes.

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:17.760
 I should mention the work of Ravenskov, a doctor who researched the role of saturated fats and unsaturated

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:28.760
 and showed that there's no basis whatsoever at any time in history for the cholesterol scare.

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:32.760
 Okay. Do you know the spelling of his name so people can write it down?

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:37.760
 R-A-V-E-N-S-K-O-V

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:41.760
 Right. Okay. Is he Eastern European or?

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:46.760
 His first name I think is Oufi.

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.760
 Oufi. U-F-F-E or?

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.760
 I think U-F-E.

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:52.760
 U-F-E. Okay. Good.

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:59.760
 Okay. So, Oufi Ravenskov, for those people that are listening who'd like to know any more about the wise and wherefores of that.

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:02.760
 Okay. So, that's about two minutes too.

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:04.760
 So, we're going to start to wrap up here.

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:08.760
 So, thank you so much, Dr. Peat, for giving your time to the people that are listening.

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:11.760
 We really appreciate your time and expertise.

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:12.760
 Okay.

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.760
 And thank you, callers, for calling in.

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.760
 Okay. So, that's the third Friday of July.

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:21.760
 We'll be back the third Friday of August.

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:22.760
 Summer's moving right along.

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.760
 It's getting warmer and warmer now.

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:29.760
 And I hope when we come back next time you guys will have got plenty of vitamin D from the sunshine.

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.760
 Make sure you get exposed to it.

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:32.760
 Obviously, you don't have to sit there and burn.

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:34.760
 But get plenty of vitamin D.

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:35.760
 Make sure you get your saturated fats.

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.760
 Avoid the liquid oils.

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.760
 Make sure you get plenty of calcium and all that good stuff.

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:43.760
 So, anyway, until the next third Friday of August, good night.

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:44.760
 Good night.
