00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.520
 From the third Friday of every month... Could you try a different mic actually?

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.080
 Okay, one minute. Let me just try this one here, number three.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.080
 Let's see what number three is doing tonight. How is this one going? That sounds better, doesn't it? Okay, good.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.120
 Well, thank you for tuning in, those who have tuned in to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.160
 As I was saying, every third Friday of the month we do a one hour...

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.640
 Well, we do, my wife and I, but it's just myself and has been for a little while now.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.160
 Okay, so I do a radio show every third Friday of the month for one hour and it is a call-in.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.280
 So from 7.30 until 8 o'clock we have the phone lines open with people asking questions related to the show.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.160
 And every month we do a different topic.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.120
 Sometimes it's a continuation of a topic that may take a month or two or even three to get through.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.760
 And every month, as has been the custom since about 2007 now, we're joined by Dr. Raymond Peat,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.720
 who has very much been a mentor and a listening ear, as well as an excellent guide for things that

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.720
 I thought were true once upon a time when I was at university studying herbal medicine,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:25.840
 but which have just repeated doctrines and dogmas of professors and other professionals

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.840
 who taught themselves by mainstream science in all of its splendor,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.120
 but with its very apparent mistakes and repeated mistakes.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.560
 So, like I said, every third Friday of the month, I'm very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat on the phone with us.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.960
 So let's just see if Dr. Peat is there with us. Are you there?

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.520
 Yes.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.200
 Okay. Well, thanks so much, as always, for giving your time every month like you do.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.480
 I really appreciate it.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.240
 I wanted just for the sake of people that have tuned in or are just tuning in for the first time,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.040
 who may have never heard you, if you would just give an outline of your academic and professional background

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.040
 so people can hear where you're coming from.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:17.040
 My early education was in literature, painting, general humanities, including philosophy.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:26.240
 And then after about 10 years, in 1968, I went to graduate school in biology,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:36.480
 intending to study nerve biology and finding that that was the most dogmatic of the biological studies.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:44.720
 I found the most empirical people in the department were working on reproductive physiology.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:54.320
 And so I did my PhD in basically reproductive endocrinology and physiology.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:02.560
 1972 was when I got my PhD and I've been studying and writing and consulting since then.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:15.200
 Yeah. Okay, good. I want to just quickly go back to last month and wrapping up the discussion on the effects of progesterone

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.360
 and how the PROTECT and SYNAP studies are flawed and how that whole thing,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.800
 which showed in the paper that progesterone was not effective,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.080
 actually had some very bad designs in the trials and the flawed studies were quite apparent when you look to the science objectively.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.640
 And so we gave people information about that and where to go.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.400
 But I just wanted to say in the it's kind of shocked me a little bit because I don't often say these kind of things,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.240
 a little bit like their reversal on coconut oil being actually good for you now and the liquid oils may actually be harmful.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:55.600
 The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists actually gave a few guidelines.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.480
 And I found that these are pretty stunning. Given the debate about sugar, they said that diet.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.880
 And this is in relation to easing premenstrual syndrome. And this was in relation to estrogen and progesterone,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.000
 mainly estrogen supposedly being the good the good hormone and progesterone being the bad.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.800
 But we know it's the other way around. They said that keeping blood sugar levels up with more smaller,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.520
 frequent meals might be helpful. So I know you've been a big proponent of keeping blood sugar up with something,

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.040
 whether it's liquid milk or orange juice or some liquid food or in fact,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.760
 carbohydrate or sugar containing food every two hours. I thought that was pretty good.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.840
 And they also mentioned calcium and magnesium, both found in yogurt and leafy vegetables, for example,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.600
 and that magnesium might alleviate mood swings and physical symptoms like bloating from water retention.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.080
 So they're actually giving a thumbs up to sugar, magnesium and calcium, which is good.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.200
 Before we move on to the subject of sleep and repair in this month's show,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:11.120
 I wanted to go over what you might be able to describe in your terms as the benefits of positive thinking.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.960
 And also just wanted to mention for those people that have tuned in, the number to reach us is 707-923-3911.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.400
 So from 730 until the end of the show, eight o'clock, that's the number to call with questions.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.920
 So I wanted to explore the remodeling of reality, which is possible from exercising the conscious mind

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.800
 through higher ideals, through positive affirmations.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.480
 And that this remodeling also benefits the physical body in terms of cell repair like sleep.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.880
 And that's going to be one of the topics for a larger part of this show.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.400
 Now, biblically, the prophet spoke to the people in terms that they could relate to,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:55.920
 and they used agrarian concepts and analogies like sowing and reaping, harvest and famine, pestilence and abundance.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.840
 And now the mind really can be viewed as a garden also, and a good gardener tends his garden.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.960
 So negative thoughts like doubt and feelings of inadequacy and fear are the weeds which spring up automatically in your garden,

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:17.120
 sometimes outcompeting the very garden of prosperity with its fruits and flowers, which we all have access to, with a positive mind.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.360
 So universal quantum and spiritual laws govern our lives, and if you think any other, you're wrong.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:30.960
 The soil is your mind, the seed is the thought, the water is your action, and the sun is your feelings.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.280
 Whatever you plant in your mind and water, the same will also have to grow.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.680
 There are times or seasons, and you've heard phrases like "when the time is right" or "in due season",

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:48.400
 for the descriptive spark which ignites the flame of action. So be careful what you plant and give yourself to.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:57.120
 And positive affirmations and the cultivation of a beautiful garden of the mind benefit the organism in ways which science is just beginning to put into words,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:05.760
 as we are now ready to understand, and I've said many times that we're in the age of knowledge, and it is exponentially increasing.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:12.560
 Quantum physics now explains the observer effect, as best demonstrated by the double slit experiment,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.560
 which shows that the very act of observing interacts with the observed, affecting the outcome,

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:25.440
 and the same can be inferred that the mind and thoughts can and do affect conscious reality and physical health.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:32.240
 So, what comes to your mind, Dr. Peat, listening then to the subject of positive affirmation, and that your mind is a garden?

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.760
 Do you have any thoughts on that?

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:43.840
 In between working in literature and linguistics, and going back to school to study biology,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:54.480
 I had an experimental college, Blake College, and my theory there was that there are deliberate attempts

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:03.920
 to plant bad seeds in our garden. And my approach to education was that if you create the right environment,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:15.120
 people can uproot those planted bad seeds and create themselves a fresh, new way of looking at the world.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:25.760
 And we found that people who had thought they were inferior students in just four, five, or six months,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:34.000
 in that environment where they were expected to be fully functioning, became fully functioning,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:44.880
 and achieved more in five or six months than the average American college graduate achieves in the whole four years.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.160
 This is through a kind of more of a liberal, for the sake of the word being liberal,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:09:00.240
 philosophies to the subject of understanding and learning, rather than just rote memory and recapitulation of facts.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:10.160
 Yeah, because lots of bad intentions are being implanted along with the educational indoctrination that most people are getting.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:18.640
 Yeah, I mean, you've had complete access to that indoctrination in your own studies in terms of what the professors believed

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:29.840
 and what attitudes they had towards students that were challenging that with some kind of new science perspective,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:36.160
 which actually wasn't new, which was actually probably 80 or 100 years old, but had been supplanted, if you like,

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:43.920
 by the new dogma, especially in genetics and this genetic determinism, the whole theory of it.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.440
 Yeah, which was powered largely by a political ideology.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:10:03.120
 Malthusianism and genetic determinism were very consciously political ideas which were then accepted into science, supposedly,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:09.680
 because the funding came from the people with that political orientation.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.200
 It's not a long stretch, but what do you think about faith healing?

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.000
 Just to put it out there, I haven't asked you, I haven't prepped you with these questions, but I just want...

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.640
 Well, that's exactly analogous to what we were doing at Blake College,

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.160
 which was healing people from the cultural disease that had been given.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:39.920
 And there's a fairly recent book, last 20 years, I think, it was published by Larry Dossie called, I think,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.920
 "Words that Heal" or "Healing Words," something like that.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:51.840
 And an older book published in Russian in 1930 and then in English in 1959,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:58.880
 it's called "Words as a Physiological and Therapeutic Factors,"

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.040
 the word as a way to handle ideas and thoughts.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:13.360
 In both of these cases, they're treating words or thoughts as healing physiological factors.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:20.640
 So it's exactly putting in scientific terms that idea of faith healing.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:29.760
 Yeah, I mean, do you think that the concept of, because I've always said, and I've long believed it is true,

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:35.120
 fortunately or unfortunately for some or even myself, but in terms of medicine,

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.560
 I often find the word diagnosis is almost a kiss of death for some people.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:47.440
 When you get a diagnosis for something and the doctors or the scientists want to put it in terms that

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.440
 will help you come to terms with what it is that they're diagnosing you with,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.040
 I find that when people don't actually, because I have quite a lot of contact with people who,

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.000
 as you can imagine, and obviously from your background, come from an alternative background,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.600
 and they're not sold on mainstream medicine, they're not sold on mainstream science,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:14.720
 but they're very open-minded and able to understand concepts which certainly are based in science

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.760
 and which maybe they haven't really heard of too much of, but it's there when they go searching for it.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:27.760
 These people that I consult with that maybe haven't had a diagnosis that they will tell me in terms of symptoms

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:36.480
 and/or other physical facts point me in a direction where, although I'm not saying it as a diagnosis,

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:43.840
 because that's not what I do, it's in terms of just generally counselling with people and recommending changes that will be positive.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:50.560
 Those people that come with a diagnosis, I think sometimes a diagnosis is a very roadblock to their improvement,

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:58.720
 and when they haven't come with a diagnosis, but I'm fairly sure what a diagnosis would be if they were in front of a traditional doctor,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:04.800
 they make some pretty quick progress through change.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:14.720
 Partly because I had the experience of my father having been diagnosed as diabetic, and he had acquaintances

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:23.040
 who were dependent on injecting insulin every day, and he didn't like that idea, so he wasted away to,

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:29.120
 I think it was less than 100 pounds before searching in libraries.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:38.480
 They found old books that described using brewer's yeast, and for a few weeks he lived on pure brewer's yeast

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:51.200
 and completely overcame the conversion of food to glucose in the urine, and put on weight and lived 40 years, 45 years more.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:14:04.000
 That caused me to ask people how their diabetes was diagnosed, and over the years that I've been doing that,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:15.120
 40 or 50 years, I've only found two or three people who actually had a sane diagnosis in terms of what was known at the time.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:25.520
 For example, in the 1940s it was known that excessive cortisol would create all the symptoms of diabetes,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:32.080
 wasting away of the muscles and other tissues, turning it into glucose.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:51.280
 As I inquired, I found that the practical approach to diabetes was simply to see if they had high blood sugar,

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:59.280
 maybe even sugar in the urine, and then prescribe the insulin or one of the other treatments to lower the blood sugar.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:10.480
 But I don't recall ever running into someone who's cortisol and prolactin and parathyroid hormone and all of the relative things,

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:18.160
 growth hormone and so on, whether those were even considered at all in the diagnosis.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:25.120
 So as a separate subject, perhaps I wasn't going to go in this direction, but we don't have to go there for long,

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:34.960
 but do you definitively see diabetes as an example here of pancreatic islet cell destruction per se?

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:42.320
 You probably see the destruction in terms of a different process, or do you define it like that even?

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.280
 Yeah, it becomes a side effect of whatever else is killing you.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:59.920
 The stress, which might be malnutrition or emotional stress, overwork, many things can cause the high cortisol,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:08.720
 which then damages the beta cells and mobilizing the fats from storage during stress.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:19.760
 A lack of sleep, for example, creates a diabetic condition and chronic stress, including poor sleep quality,

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.720
 leads to the hormonal situation, which damages the pancreas.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:36.560
 And the fatty acids, when you are treating it improperly, you keep exposing the pancreas to these toxic fatty acids.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:46.720
 It turns out that glucose, when it's predominant in the blood, causes regeneration from stem cells,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.560
 regeneration and differentiation of new beta cells.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:17:02.960
 But when you're under stress and improperly treated, your free fatty acids and cortisol come in and kill the new cells.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:09.920
 Let's hold it there for a moment, because I think when I get into your sleep and aging newsletter,

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.560
 I think there's reference and relevance to the question of diabetes in there.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.280
 So for those people who've just tuned in or just listening to the show now, from 7.30 to 8pm,

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.680
 we'll open the phone lines up to question Dr. Peat, either about this month's subject,

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.880
 or it's going to be the sleep and aging, and/or the opening topic of Positive Thinking.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.520
 The number to reach us is 707-923-3911.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.080
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, sleep and aging then.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.880
 So concerning sleep and the varying lengths one species needs compared to another,

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.760
 do you see sleep more necessary for brain repair or restructuring and energy renewal,

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.120
 or for tissue repair throughout the body, or all of it?

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.480
 And then what do you suggest is a minimum number of hours for a sleeping adult?

00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:02.480
 The rest of your body can't repair itself unless it has a brain in good working order.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:07.920
 The most sensitive thing to the stress is the brain itself.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:16.080
 When the brain can't repair itself and impose the resting state on the rest of the organism,

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.960
 then you get things like the chronic excess of free fatty acids and cortisol,

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:27.440
 which destroy not only the pancreas, but all of the other organs to different degrees.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.480
 So these stress hormones directly affect sleep?

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:40.640
 Yeah, when the blood sugar isn't able to produce the carbon dioxide that it should,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:46.640
 it's wasted, becomes a lactic acid rather than carbon dioxide,

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:56.400
 raises the pH of the cell interior, creates a catabolic excited state

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:04.640
 in which the brain cells ultimately end up dying or being blocked so that they can't act,

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.640
 even if they stay alive.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:13.840
 And in reaction to the falling oxidation of glucose,

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:20.800
 you get the rise of adrenaline, which tries to activate cells.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.480
 It provides more glucose if you have that in storage,

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.440
 and that can remedy the situation.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.760
 That's why it's there.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:37.040
 The adrenaline should bring up the glucose and stop the stress reaction.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.240
 But if you don't have enough stored glucose,

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:45.200
 then you resort to the cortisol level of stress adaptation.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.800
 The cortisol provides the glucose by breaking down your muscle cells

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:56.960
 and thymus skin cells, turning it into glucose.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:02.800
 And if that glucose doesn't solve the problem,

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.840
 then you get a chronic recurring stress,

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.600
 low blood sugar, increased adrenaline,

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.800
 increased cortisol and whole breakdown process.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:26.800
 Okay. So I think getting on to the subject of how science and scientists view the brain

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:32.400
 and in terms of its overarching control of the body and homeostasis,

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.760
 there seems to be kind of two trains of thought

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.080
 where they have what they call "the cognitive scientist"

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.560
 thinking of the brain as a computer,

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.280
 and then other more open-minded scientists

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.600
 looking at the brain as a kind of cybernetic control system

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.000
 with a kind of a life, obviously it's alive,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.240
 but a kind of life of its own in terms of being an autonomous functioning unit

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.560
 rather than an on-off switch.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:10.000
 Norbert Wiener, who invented cybernetics in the English-speaking world,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.800
 he, I would consider,

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:23.200
 probably the best information theorist in terms of the brain and how it works

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:30.880
 as a control mechanism integrated intimately with the metabolism of the body.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:37.280
 So it's a metabolic control system as well as an interpreter

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:42.640
 of how the body relates to its ecosystem.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.560
 Relative to Norbert Wiener's view of the organism,

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.960
 I think you could consider the average cognitive scientist

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.960
 as somewhat autistic or abstracted out of reality.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:02.640
 Okay, moving on to the subject of energy

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:09.120
 and what I understand now through talking to you and working with others,

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.200
 in terms of what you've always mentioned as the Achilles tendon reflex

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.320
 being a predominant indicator of hypothyroidism

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:24.480
 because the energy state of the cell in a healthy cell

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:30.640
 ultimately is charged, electrically charged, positively rested and ready

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.280
 to begin an action potential and that in the tendon reflex

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.320
 when there's a slow return to the resting state

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.760
 that shows that the cell has been overstimulated

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.400
 and just like in sleep, if we don't get enough sleep

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.840
 we are essentially too excited in terms of people that are insomniacs,

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.360
 for example, too excited to be able to get that

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.600
 relaxation so that we have that energy in the morning when we get up like we do

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.280
 when we're healthy and strong and we get lots of sugar in our diet and our

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.400
 thyroids are good and vitamin D and everything else and calcium

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:14.320
 so that we're charged and ready to go. So the ability to relax and to accumulate

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.360
 energy and the substance of differentiation then,

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:22.000
 this is a predominantly oxidative high energy

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.200
 production system. And as a third

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:36.000
 dimension of this, comparing the brain to the cramping calf muscle in the

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.440
 Achilles reflex test, if you think of the cancer cell

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:48.160
 as an energy deprived, overexcited cell, it has the exact situation

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:55.200
 of the fatigued or are seizing brain cells or the cramping

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:01.440
 muscle cells. Deficiency of sugar or oxygen will cause cramping in the

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.240
 muscles, insomnia or seizure in the brain and

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.240
 compulsive growth and diffusion in the cancer cell.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.920
 And so this excitotoxicity,

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:18.720
 the term for this then, it would refer very well to cancer cells. They're

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.360
 just completely excited and unable to

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:28.480
 relax ultimately. Apart from apoptosis and the regular cell death

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.520
 mechanisms by which normal cells or the body maintains its normalcy rather

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.680
 than growing out of control or out of the bounds of what's

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.760
 needed of it. Some doctors have mentioned that you could diagnose

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:47.840
 cancerous lymph nodes in the armpit in relation to breast cancer just by

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.920
 touching them without needing to do a biopsy because

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.240
 it turns out that cancer cells are hardened the same way

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.240
 a cramped muscle is hardened. Just by the touch

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.840
 of a cancer cell, it shouldn't be hard. It should be

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:10.320
 relaxed and full of energy, ready to work but it's in the cramped working state.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.480
 Right, interesting. Okay, so this is when they describe these things.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.480
 Okay, well here's the thing. They describe soft tumors and hard tumors.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.360
 Don't they have a different, the doctors as it is, you know,

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.000
 don't have a differentiation for these kind of tumors?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.720
 Well, the soft tumor is harder than that tissue is normally. Right, right.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.920
 Okay, so the hard tumors are just at the stage beyond that.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.600
 Okay, all right, well it's coming up to 7.30 now so if people want to call in

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.400
 about this month's topic, sleep and aging and/or the positive

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.920
 thoughts, affirmations and how that controls our reality

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.360
 in terms of the double slit experiment and the

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:55.280
 actual evidence of an observer effect changing the state of the observed and

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.960
 the whole quantum physics thing. I know it's a pretty big subject but I

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.120
 think it's totally open to debate in terms of

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:08.720
 supporting its tenants. The number is 707-923-3911.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.320
 I do see the lights flashing so I think we do have our first caller. Caller,

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.520
 you're on the air. What's your question and where are you from?

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:23.360
 Yeah, I'm from Brooklyn and the question is right on topic. About a month ago,

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:30.400
 out of the blue, I developed a rash on my neck inside of my

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.520
 forearms and in my underarms. It's just red. It's not, it's just

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.920
 very red and bumpy so it feels like there's a little bit of fibrosis.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.920
 Never had this before. Other than that, I have no issues.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:49.600
 You know, 60-ish and at night it wakes me up or seems to

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:54.800
 be correlated with waking up between one and two, literally only

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.120
 sleeping like two and a half hours, three hours.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.120
 Then I'm up for several hours and I go back to sleep. So the comment about sleep

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:06.160
 and aging and the comment about sort of diagnosis

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.400
 sort of is brought together here with this issue because I did go to a

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.360
 dermatologist and they said, "Oh, you have this rash."

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:18.240
 And they gave me a product called Triamcinolone

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.960
 acetinide cream which has precautions of

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.800
 allegedly reversible HPA axis suppression,

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.240
 manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:37.280
 and glucosuria, all of which apparently are reversible. So I didn't

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.200
 fill it but it's been 30 days. I've tried a bunch of different things,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.960
 kind of like your father did with the brewer's yeast and the thing is still

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:50.720
 there. So I was just wondering for what would say an otherwise, you know,

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:55.440
 repeat type diet which has been very positive with eyesight,

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.640
 you know, muscle strength, no pain in the joints,

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.880
 all that's good but this rash comes out of nowhere and it's literally going on a

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:08.240
 month now. So it's becoming chronic which has elevated my concern. So

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.240
 in summary, I didn't take the antibiotic they provided

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.520
 and I'm not taking anything other than putting

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.600
 you know some aloe vera on it. Somebody recommended something called rose hip oil

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:26.880
 which does have, you know, maybe some PUFA related additives

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.120
 and something called, you know, black cumin seed oil which also has

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:36.080
 omega-6s in it, I mean 50 percent, but these are things I've been trying and I

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.800
 was just wondering whether you have any commentary on both the

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.120
 sleep issue and, you know, what one might do to get rid of the stress

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.640
 associated with this skin rash. Yeah, okay, well I know that quickly the

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.760
 rose hip oil was probably a vitamin c component of that although you mentioned

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.560
 the oil was probably a polyunsaturated, but Dr. Peat,

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.520
 what do you have to say about the rash that he's just described?

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.960
 The first thing I would do or that I do whenever I have a symptom like that is

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:09.040
 to put lots of sodium chloride,

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.480
 get it for ice cream freezers so you can put

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.440
 a couple of pounds in a bathtub and about a pound of baking soda

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:24.240
 and make a slightly hyperosmotic solution and soak in it for a while and

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:32.240
 that usually takes care of minor skin problems, but some people

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:39.440
 make an application of baking soda and sodium chloride just as a soothing

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:43.920
 thing, but it has much of the effect that a drug like

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.240
 triamcinolone or glucocorticoids in general,

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:55.600
 which doctors love because they'll make everything feel better even if it's

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.400
 making you sick in the long run. Yeah, exactly, it was definitely a band-aid

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.480
 approach, kind of what Andrew was saying earlier.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:06.480
 So you're saying a pound of sodium chloride, that's not salt though, you got

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.480
 to say it's just any clean salt and

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:16.240
 standard baking soda make a fairly salty bath and soak in it for

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.920
 half an hour or more. Okay, so it's a pound of

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.160
 baking soda and a pound of sodium chloride?

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:26.240
 Something like that, it doesn't have to be exact, but

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:31.120
 when people experiment with the solutions it can be

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.800
 up to two or three times as concentrated as sea water

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.080
 and the average sea water is about twice as concentrated

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:44.480
 as our body fluids for sodium. How about like that dry CO2 you talked

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:49.040
 about in the past, is that worth doing too? The CO2?

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:54.000
 The dry CO2 bath, is that? Well, the baking soda has that function

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 because the sodium holds the bicarbonate in

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.240
 solution so it doesn't bubble out of the warm

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.640
 water, but your body has such a high affinity

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:10.960
 for carbon dioxide that it will pull, even the bicarbonate will be

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.320
 pulled into your body against the gradient,

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.840
 which the body is already pretty concentrated with

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:25.520
 with CO2, but the bicarbonate will help to increase that and

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:31.120
 the warm water doesn't hold much gaseous carbon dioxide, but

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:36.160
 it's a healing component in mineral water, which is carbonated,

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.120
 but it's a very low concentration compared to what you can get from the

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:47.360
 baking soda and a pure CO2 dry bath

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.880
 instantly starts raising your body's carbon dioxide with the anti-inflammatory

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:57.760
 effect. There's a good article published in a

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.400
 US, I think Michigan State Medical Journal,

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:08.960
 1905 on the uses of a carbon dioxide

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:15.440
 gas bath. Is that good to do as a separate matter, like for 30

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.640
 minutes? I mean, I did it once and it was cold

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.480
 initially, but then it sort of makes your skin hot, which is kind of odd.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.560
 Yeah, because it relaxes the blood vessels and

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:31.440
 when you notice your skin getting pink, that means you're fairly well

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.920
 saturated with it. Got it. So does it matter whether you do

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.880
 it 10 minutes or 30 minutes or an hour? Does it matter? Or is it

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.680
 better to do it like maybe, given that I have a chronic

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.440
 condition, like a few times every day or a couple times a day until

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.960
 this goes away? Yeah, I think it's fine to do it an hour

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.080
 or more every day if you're doing something like

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:59.600
 strengthening your bones. Recent Japanese studies

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:05.600
 have tried applying it externally to the skin for squamous

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:10.160
 cancer of the mouth and getting good results.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.800
 Right, right. Okay, that's great. And the sleep thing about getting up

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.560
 between, so I get up and then like I have a carrot salad or something

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.800
 and a glass of milk and then I use the red lamp and I can get back to sleep, but

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.760
 that's a lot of work. I mean, it sounds like I ought to, you know, to

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.760
 your point about degeneration of the brain, etc. I mean, my

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:35.280
 brain seems okay right now, but you know, getting a straight

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:40.720
 shot of six hours, you know, with three one and a half hour cycles, maybe a

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.080
 little bit of dreaming would be a much better thing than

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.520
 waking up at, you know, sleeping three and a half hours,

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.720
 waking up for two hours, then sleeping another three and a half

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.080
 hours to get seven or four hours to get seven and a half hours of sleep.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:59.600
 I think the main thing that causes that age-related

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:06.000
 interrupted sleep is that things like decreased thyroid

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.240
 function slow your digestive processes and as

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.880
 your blood sugar falls in darkness and when you're

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:19.440
 sleeping, the falling blood sugar lets you

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:27.440
 experience a toxic reaction to the whatever is in your intestine and the

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:32.000
 irritation, inflammation, and absorption of endotoxin and

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 surges of serotonin from the intestine, those get into the bloodstream,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.520
 finish off your stored glycogen and wake you up with a stress reaction.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:51.280
 And so trying to have the calmest, cleanest intestine possible

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.600
 at bedtime. Does that mean having a carrot salad before bed or something?

00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.480
 Because it doesn't seem like I have a stomachache or any problems or anything.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.480
 I mean, maybe, is it always the case that it has to be the intestine?

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:09.680
 You know, I mean, I don't know, I guess. What do you do to prevent this?

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:15.520
 Having a carrot salad or a good bowl of cooked mushrooms or some

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:21.520
 slightly antiseptic fiber like that in the early afternoon

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:28.080
 and then having a fairly low protein, high carbohydrate supper right before

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:33.440
 bed like ice cream or a chicken broth

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:39.200
 that's very salty. A combination of salt and sugar right at bedtime

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.360
 helps to relax the intestine for a longer period.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.560
 Okay, we do have another caller on the line. I appreciate

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.680
 you calling in and I just want to make sure we give time to other people

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.880
 that are lined up. For those who are listening, the number here is

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.840
 707-923-3911 with Dr. Peat on the line.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.800
 So let's take this next call. Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.520
 What's your question? Hello, am I on the air? Yeah, where are you

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:10.240
 from and what's your question? I'm from Arcata, California. Okay.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.080
 I have a question about the Brewer's Beast and the diabetes

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:19.200
 and I'll take an answer off the air but I'm just wondering, I have to give myself

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.640
 an insulin injection every day. I'm very attracted to the idea of not

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:28.640
 having to do that but how might one, well,

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:35.600
 A, why does Brewer's yeast work and did Dr. Peat's father just

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.520
 eat nothing but Brewer's yeast? How might one

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:44.000
 transition from a possibly healing Brewer's yeast diet

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.880
 and get off insulin or, anyway, that's my question. Just some

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.280
 elaboration on diabetes and Brewer's yeast. Thank you.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.960
 Okay, thank you. I think one of the functions of Brewer's yeast

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:05.680
 is the high niacin. Okay, you need to turn your,

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.320
 hang up the phone, I think so. Okay, go ahead, Dr. Peat.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.320
 The high niacin content of the Brewer's yeast

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:19.680
 is a very effective thing for lowering the free fatty acids

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.400
 and the free fatty acids are the main things killing the beta cells

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.400
 and there are a couple of articles on glucose

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:35.040
 and diabetes on my website that describe the results of

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:41.760
 a couple doctors in the late 19th century and the high sugar diet but

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:48.880
 niacin and sugar are two things that hold down the liberation of the toxic

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:54.480
 free fatty acids and anything you can do to

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:59.280
 interfere with those free fatty acids which are toxic to the

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.680
 pancreas will help it heal. Okay, good. All right, let's hold it

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.120
 there. Okay, so unless there's no one else at

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.760
 the moment, let's just check in with the engineer.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.440
 Okay, good. All right, so actually I had a question, Michael from

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.520
 Woodway calling. Go ahead. Can you talk a little about water and the best water and

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.560
 about how much water and the importance of water in the diet?

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.520
 Dr. Peat doesn't really believe in drinking water but let's ask Dr. Peat

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:28.640
 what his opinion is about water. Yeah, go ahead. If you're really thirsty,

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:33.440
 water is what you need but if you're drinking milk

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:38.000
 and orange juice to get your calories and protein and calcium and

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.960
 so on, you usually don't need any plain water because the amount of water

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:49.440
 you're taking in to get those nutrients is usually on

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.920
 the order of a gallon or so. Okay, there you go. Good. All right,

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.800
 well the lights have started flashing in the studio again so the engineer's

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.160
 answering the call. Let's see if we have another caller here.

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.000
 No, okay, they hang up. All right, so Dr. Peat, I just wanted to

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.560
 move on in terms of the sleep and aging article that you've mentioned here that

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.280
 the concentration of cortisol found in the blood

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:18.720
 started to increase when the light was turned off and that this darkness is a

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:23.280
 stimulus for cortisol production and now this is whether the person was asleep or

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.480
 not. So just the pure presence of darkness, obviously this is

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.520
 why the long winter nights are probably very damaging for most people because

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.440
 they just don't get enough exposure to sunlight and showing that

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:37.280
 the stress of darkness creates an

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:41.280
 inefficient catabolic state where you start breaking yourself down

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:47.760
 and this is mainly from cortisol again in order to generate glucose and that

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.680
 sleep to some extent reduces the stress but

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.440
 you mentioned and this is again part of red light

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.280
 therapy and red light treatment that people use just during the daytime for

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.480
 things like skin conditions as you mentioned that

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:07.680
 first caller from Brooklyn perhaps the red light there but that

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:14.240
 red light itself is a electron quenching wavelength of light

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:19.680
 that the stress of darkness you know we sleep every night and now

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:26.480
 this month about the article on stress sorry sleep and aging the stress of

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.640
 darkness is itself very damaging and

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.920
 you mentioned here where cortisol rises generating

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:38.000
 free fatty acids and all those stress hormones that are very harmful to us

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.360
 but yet the sleep is so necessary and deep sleep especially so necessary for

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:48.880
 tissue repair and you know cell healing that

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.320
 it's a kind of double-edged sword you know you get

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.280
 exposed to darkness whether you're sleeping or not but especially when

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.000
 you're asleep and your cortisol starts to rise but

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.280
 that red light and exposure a pre-bedtime exposure to red light can

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:09.840
 mitigate a lot of this yeah the Chinese study found that it

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:14.400
 not only improved the depth of the sleep but it improved the

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.920
 athletic performance the next day after the

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.680
 good sleep following the red light treatment

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:29.760
 about 40 years ago someone experimented with putting living tissue

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:36.480
 for example a seed was a very self-contained easy to study material

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:44.080
 they found that if it was exposed to ultraviolet light or sunlight

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:48.160
 and then you put it in an electron spin resonance

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:55.600
 machine or paramagnetic resonance device to measure free radicals or

00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:00.880
 free electrons but after the ultraviolet light exposure

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:06.880
 it kept in the machine it would show free radicals or free electrons for

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:12.080
 hours and hours without any new exposure but if they

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.840
 right after putting it in the machine if they shined red light on it

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:20.400
 it went quiet the red light just knocked out the free radicals

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:27.280
 immediately and experiments with gamma rays on frogs showed the same thing

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.600
 a dose of gamma rays that would kill the frogs

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.680
 if it was followed immediately by red light exposure

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:43.680
 it quenched the excited electrons and the frogs didn't die

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.520
 in the past we've talked about we've done a show on red light and

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.720
 light in general in terms of these anti-inflammatory effects

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.120
 what kind of distance under the skin do you think red light will penetrate

00:42:55.120 --> 00:43:01.520
 the deepest core of the body? yeah you know when someone is has their

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.360
 back to the sun how red their ears look or if you put a

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:09.680
 flashlight under your hand in the dark you see the red light coming right

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.960
 through your your hand one night i let my eyes get adapted

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.240
 by sleeping until about four in the morning

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:25.600
 and then put a red light behind my thigh and i could my whole thigh

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:31.520
 was illuminated a bright red color except the bone left a

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:37.600
 shadow like an x-ray. okay all right so i wanted to carry on

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:42.960
 here with just another reference to the permanently contracted

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:49.200
 unable to relax state of cells and this relationship to stress

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:54.800
 and in the the elderly okay so most and again i'm fortunate you know i'm not

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.920
 i don't know about you i think you probably have very good sleep too but

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:02.160
 i've never had a problem sleeping and i sleep oh i can sleep for 10 hours for

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.680
 sure and i wake up feeling just fine and

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:09.440
 don't get any kind of insomnia if i wake up at all in the night i'm back to sleep

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:14.560
 again in about 30 seconds and so with old people though right as

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.240
 people get older they talk about people needing less sleep and i think this is a

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.160
 a bit of a misnomer i don't think people need less sleep i think people need the

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.680
 same amount of sleep and when they don't get it they get less relaxation

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.200
 so they talk about the elderly and that their hearts

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.880
 failing and the muscle being another typical muscle

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.320
 i mean although cardiac and skeletal muscle do have physiological differences

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.800
 they're still muscles and when the cardiac muscle can't relax

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.720
 just like a skeletal muscle can't relax when it's over excited and it

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:49.840
 the thyroid hormone is not adequate enough to allow relaxation fully

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:54.080
 they basically get these heart failure type pictures

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:58.720
 scenarios coming on as part of their old age and it's not at all related to their

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:02.800
 old age it's because they just don't don't have enough relaxation going on

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:10.800
 so how about this in terms of the elderly and the inability to

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:16.400
 relax or their insomnia and it's related to their cardiac cycle

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:20.480
 i think it's exactly the same thing the

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.920
 heart doesn't beat strongly because it doesn't relax

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:30.880
 fully the the diastolic relaxation just isn't there

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:36.240
 as the energy production decreases and the same thing with the brain the

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.080
 relaxation is impaired the same way as the heart

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:44.240
 relaxation all right so now you're getting on to

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:47.920
 that uh revisiting rather the uh the red light

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.520
 thing that um you've you stated in your newsletter here that

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.960
 if you're exposed to it at the beginning of the night

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.640
 it can not only improve your sleep but also

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:02.320
 the next day's performance and this was a japanese

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:07.920
 our paper that was written in 2012 so they have objectively looked at the

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.120
 performance of a group of people that they were studying who actually

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:15.440
 physically performed better the next day directly proportional to their

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:22.960
 red light exposure the night before yes wow yeah incredible okay

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.000
 so the number here if anyone's listening and they want to question dr

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.800
 pete uh is 707 923 3911

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:37.680
 so i had a question that was posed by a person i think they wrote this

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:42.960
 wrote this question in and i wonder actually if it may have got

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.240
 asked last month but let me ask you again um

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:51.040
 somebody who was uh wondering about using pregnenolone

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.960
 and i think because of bad publicity or whatever else you know

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.720
 that they've been worried about progesterone and pregnenolone they've

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.880
 kind of put them in the same basket um they've read about this subject

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:09.120
 called pregnenolone steel where people with worn out adrenals

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:14.000
 apparently uh get this issue where pregnenolone is

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.160
 stolen and converted into cortisol is that even possible

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:23.280
 oh whenever you are making cortisol you're making it from

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:31.360
 a pregnenolone ultimately and uh it you should have a huge

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:38.560
 excess of pregnenolone and progesterone and only make small amounts of

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.760
 the terminal hormones such as cortisol and

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:49.600
 estrogen as needed but the bulk of the steroids produced

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:53.440
 should be heavily in favor of pregnenolone and progesterone because

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.040
 those are stabilizing materials i don't even

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:04.080
 consider those to be hormones the only direct action that

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:08.480
 has been identified for pregnenolone is that it

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:16.240
 helps tissues give up excess water and it allows the fascia

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:22.960
 the connective tissue to regain its normal tone and so it can

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.160
 when you reach the right level it can make wrinkles in your

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:31.760
 your saggy neck skin disappear okay all right uh well let's take this

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.240
 next caller uh caller you're on the air where you're

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.840
 from what's your question i'm up on wilder ridge i wanted to know

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.680
 about the red light is it like a light bulb a lamp that you

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.000
 have on in your bedroom or yeah i wanted you to elaborate on the

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.800
 red light well the sunlight or any incandescent

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.440
 light bulb has a spectrum the sunlight is the

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:59.040
 middle of the sun spectrum is yellow the middle of

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:06.480
 an incandescent light bulb spectrum is orange and you get the full red light

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:11.200
 benefit either from sunlight or or incandescent light bulbs you don't

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:15.040
 have to get rid of it except for convenience you

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:20.640
 don't want a brilliant shiny room around you if you're trying

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.200
 to relax and so the dim quality of bright red

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:30.080
 light it isn't necessarily any brighter than

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:36.240
 a 200 watt incandescent bulb would be but

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.920
 you don't need the the blue and green part of the spectrum

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:45.680
 for the therapeutic effect those bulbs that are supposed to be like daylight

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:51.920
 which are they too bright um no if you don't need the bright white

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:56.880
 light during the daytime i have a 250 watt

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:01.760
 reflector bulb called an infrared bulb but it it looks like

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:06.640
 an ordinary white light but it runs at a lower temperature than a

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:11.360
 standard bright incandescent bulb so it's heavier

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.440
 on the the red part of the spectrum i got you

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.880
 thank you so much for your time and your effort and all your love

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:23.200
 dr pete you're awesome okay thank you for your call caller thank you

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:30.000
 so again presumably uh the more skin uh you can bear to a red light the better

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.320
 the absorption of the light although i'm sure to some extent whether you're

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.360
 wearing t-shirt or a light shirt red light will

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:41.520
 penetrate some of that yeah people have experimented with

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:48.960
 pigeons despite their feathers they can see the the systemic

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:52.080
 effect coming through their body because the red

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:57.280
 light penetrates pretty much anything living material all right we have

00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.720
 another we have another caller so caller you're on the air where you're from

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:05.840
 and what's your question uh new york is just related to the

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.400
 points just made on the pregnant alone how do you know whether you need it i

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.600
 mean you mentioned older people and stuff i mean because i

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.160
 think in previous shows dr pete you said you

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.520
 took it for a while and now you no longer take it so i'm just

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.640
 wondering how does one decide whether whether you

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:27.680
 should be taking it or not um in the 1980s when i first

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:31.520
 experimented with it a lot of younger people

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:37.920
 wanted to try it and uh good healthy people in their 30s and early 40s

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:41.120
 felt nothing they could take a spoonful and

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:47.920
 have absolutely no noticeable effect but when someone was in their late 40s

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:54.320
 or early 50s and feeling hopeless and depressed even a pinch of it 15 or 20

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:58.960
 milligrams in 15 minutes their faces would light up and they

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:03.360
 would grin and and get ambitious projects going again

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:09.040
 decide not to quit their their job so if when you need it it's a

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.960
 very vivid effect even with a small amount okay so

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.680
 you're saying that you would the trigger would be hey if

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:19.280
 you're feeling really down but if you're not feeling really down you're doing all

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.400
 the other stuff and your energy is pretty steady and

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.680
 you're as lucky as andrew to sleep the way he sleeps that's pretty impressive

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.640
 you know then you know then you're saying your body probably makes enough

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.600
 of it yeah okay that's probably why you don't

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:35.360
 take it the other thing is on water i think in one of your write-ups

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:40.480
 you you mentioned water earlier um babies are 80 percent water and older

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:45.520
 people are 55 percent water so i'm just i'm just wondering and i guess

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:48.880
 high metabolic rate relates to high water percentage in the

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:52.320
 body if you're older how is it not possible if you have

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.760
 dropped to a much lower percentage of water that

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:59.520
 you wouldn't need more water maybe it's sparkling water to get the co2

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:06.240
 and yeah the co2 and the atp are the things that hold good water in the cells

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:10.080
 while squeezing out unwanted improper water

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:17.120
 uh pregnenolone progesterone uh atp and co2 all have that

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:24.560
 effect on the cytoplasm in particular to keep it from taking on

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:28.240
 disorganized water but making it hang on to

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:32.240
 the water that's organized and running its

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:40.560
 metabolism so i i think old people will take up a lot of cellular

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:46.400
 metabolic water that increases their metabolic rate when they repair their

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:52.000
 mitochondria reduce stress hormones so you're saying

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.520
 there's good water and bad water and hanging around your cells and yeah

00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:04.880
 a healthy kids cell that contains lots of water is metabolizing

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:12.880
 intensely keeping its co2 up and its lactic acid down and

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:19.680
 that the water is part of of letting the cell run at a high rate

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:26.880
 and you can restore some of that metabolic active water with those things

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:33.040
 such as progesterone pregnenolone thyroid and carbon dioxide

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:37.200
 a great great interest one last quick question vitamin i'll just get off

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:43.760
 vitamin a d k how do you know what ratio and how much you actually need

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:47.200
 particularly for you know people as you age

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:51.360
 i mean how do you know that how do you get it

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:57.760
 um what's the ratio for example of a to d is it five to one is it four to one or

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.800
 i don't think there's a definite ratio because

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:05.440
 as your thyroid function increases you're able to use

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:10.480
 lots of vitamin a in making pregnenolone and progesterone

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:17.280
 it's coordinated with a thyroid hormone and cholesterol to convert

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.240
 cholesterol into the good hormones and if your

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:25.280
 thyroid is low then too much vitamin a

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:29.120
 interferes and lowers the thyroid function can i ask you a quick question

00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.120
 dr p i know we've got to wrap it up here

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.280
 because it's just a couple of minutes to top of the hour but

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:38.320
 in terms of pregnenolone and its production or rather its conversion

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:41.920
 cholesterol is the main building block from which these hormones are built from

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:45.840
 correct yeah and the reason cholesterol rises

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:49.760
 with age is that things like low low thyroid

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:54.480
 function and low vitamin a availability interfere with the

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.800
 production of pregnenolone and progesterone

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.480
 and so your body compensates by increasing

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:06.480
 the cholesterol and the cholesterol increase can cause your tissue

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:11.840
 production of pregnenolone and progesterone to increase

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:19.840
 to to up to the limit of the cell's capability governed by

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:23.760
 vitamin a and thyroid okay hold it there dr p let's

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:27.360
 get the last minute or two just to let people know

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:31.200
 where they can find more of your information thanks for your time okay

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:34.480
 okay so for those people who've called in thanks for your calls

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.200
 uh there's other people that called in i don't think they got a chance

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.800
 um to ask questions but thank you for trying

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:44.640
 um for those people who want to find out more about dr p um his website is

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:50.400
 www.rayPeat.com and he's got lots of articles that are

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:55.760
 fully referenced as only a post grad student would produce a

00:56:55.760 --> 00:57:00.160
 paper so lots of references there for all the things that he's saying

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:05.040
 and that caller with the uh brewer's yeast question and diabetes that there's

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.560
 a couple of good articles there on his website which go into great

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:13.520
 detail about diabetes and the dysfunction uh that is part of the

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:17.520
 cause um for those people uh who wanted a call

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:20.880
 but didn't and just listened uh dr pete's uh he's still doing what

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.480
 he's doing so um thank you very much dr p for your

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:28.080
 tireless effort and until the third friday of next month

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:34.400
 uh what with the solstice coming up here um we'll see you then
