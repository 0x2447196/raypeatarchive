WEBVTT

0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.460
 Okay, Georgi Dinkov, Ray Peat, we were just talking about redundancy, prepping, and being

0:00:04.460 --> 0:00:08.120
 prepared for a future where they kick you out of the financial system, tell you you

0:00:08.120 --> 0:00:10.800
 can't go to the grocery store, and what else, Ray?

0:00:10.800 --> 0:00:14.000
 What else will we not be allowed to do in the future?

0:00:14.000 --> 0:00:17.080
 Basically, anything that spends money.

0:00:17.080 --> 0:00:23.020
 And then, I mean, we're talking about prepping for a momentary thing, but if you're kicked

0:00:23.020 --> 0:00:25.280
 out of the financial system for life, there's

0:00:25.280 --> 0:00:28.960
 gonna have to be a rise, new kind of alternative ways of exchange, correct?

0:00:28.960 --> 0:00:33.680
 David Morgan Yeah, a lot of people are getting silver,

0:00:34.320 --> 0:00:40.080
 and gold doesn't work too well for daily exchanges because you'd have to chop it up

0:00:40.080 --> 0:00:46.300
 into tiny pieces. But silver is convenient as a practical currency.

0:00:47.560 --> 0:00:49.280
 Excuse my ignorance, but how would that even work?

0:00:49.280 --> 0:00:52.160
 Like, would the person know how much an ounce

0:00:52.160 --> 0:00:57.040
 or a tiny amount of gold would be valued at in exchange?

0:00:57.040 --> 0:01:01.240
 Yeah, but that with gold involves a certain amount

0:01:01.240 --> 0:01:07.760
 of trust that the person doesn't have some strange ally that is pawning off.

0:01:07.760 --> 0:01:15.440
 But silver is very practical in the sense that you can carry enough in your pocket to

0:01:16.000 --> 0:01:24.720
 feed yourself for quite a few days, and it's identifiable as silver rather than other things.

0:01:24.720 --> 0:01:25.000
 And then isn't in Klaus's book, I have not read the book, unfortunately, but I think he says and it's identifiable as silver rather than other things.

0:01:25.000 --> 0:01:29.400
 And then isn't in Klaus's book, I have not read the book, unfortunately, but I think

0:01:29.400 --> 0:01:33.200
 he says people will live outside the smart cities and things like that. So that alternative

0:01:33.200 --> 0:01:38.080
 economy, I mean, even the people pulling these heists are recognizing that that is going

0:01:38.080 --> 0:01:39.080
 to be a thing.

0:01:39.080 --> 0:01:40.960
 What is it going to be?

0:01:40.960 --> 0:01:44.880
 Not everybody is going to live in the smart cities with the identifications and things

0:01:44.880 --> 0:01:45.160
 like that.

0:01:45.800 --> 0:01:53.760
 Yeah, probably 70 or 80% of the people will just do whatever the government

0:01:53.760 --> 0:02:01.040
 tells them to. But if 10 or 10 or 20% of the people set up an outside economy,

0:02:01.120 --> 0:02:02.000
 it'll work.

0:02:02.040 --> 0:02:06.400
 And then Georgie interrupted any moment here. then, I mean, this is the last show of the year, you know.

0:02:06.400 --> 0:02:10.880
 What, without getting too, like, maybe an elevator pitch,

0:02:10.880 --> 0:02:13.120
 like, what, is there anything that sticks out in your mind

0:02:13.120 --> 0:02:15.440
 is, like, phenomenally important or too many things

0:02:15.440 --> 0:02:16.320
 that stick out in your mind?

0:02:16.320 --> 0:02:18.960
 Like, what are your thoughts on 2021?

0:02:18.960 --> 0:02:20.800
 About this past year?

0:02:20.800 --> 0:02:22.240
 Yeah, just everything that happened.

0:02:22.240 --> 0:02:23.600
 Just horrifying in general?

0:02:23.600 --> 0:02:25.040
 past year? Yeah, just everything that happened. Just horrifying in general?

0:02:36.480 --> 0:02:48.100
 Yeah. And the solutions are being hidden from all ends of the political spectrum. Everyone is being taught that the other end of the spectrum is out to get them. And it's really only the one hundredth of one percent which is out to get

0:02:48.100 --> 0:02:50.360
 everyone else.

0:02:50.360 --> 0:02:59.720
 The people that Hillary and Obama called the deplorables, they are just as much ready for

0:02:59.720 --> 0:03:07.440
 an actual solution and radical change as the people who think of themselves as the vanguard

0:03:07.440 --> 0:03:08.960
 and most progressive.

0:03:08.960 --> 0:03:13.280
 When I was picking up a bunch of packages, there was an art studio next to that. And

0:03:13.280 --> 0:03:16.640
 the woman kind of told me to come in the art studio and we got to talking. And then her

0:03:16.640 --> 0:03:20.760
 husband came and we inevitably started talking about COVID. And each both of them in Mexico

0:03:20.760 --> 0:03:24.640
 had three vaccines. And one was from England and the other one was from Israel. And then

0:03:24.640 --> 0:03:26.560
 we and the husband and I started talking because he

0:03:26.560 --> 0:03:31.120
 reads research and he when we were talking, he had to put me in a partisan

0:03:31.120 --> 0:03:35.760
 box like he couldn't. He had to label me as like a Trump supporter to to

0:03:35.760 --> 0:03:38.840
 entertain anything I was saying, even though I was telling him that I haven't

0:03:38.840 --> 0:03:43.440
 voted since Bush. Kerry. But like it was he was like unable to entertain any

0:03:43.440 --> 0:03:46.000
 idea outside of partisan politics, but he was English.

0:03:46.000 --> 0:03:47.880
 It wasn't even American. It was very odd.

0:03:48.280 --> 0:03:49.280
 What nationality?

0:03:49.280 --> 0:03:52.000
 He was from London and his wife wife was from Israel.

0:03:53.000 --> 0:03:58.400
 Yeah. English are more obedient than Americans.

0:03:58.400 --> 0:04:08.720
 And then the thing I've been running into any time I talk to a normal person about this is that coronavirus is so dangerous that anything is worth however tyrannical the

0:04:08.720 --> 0:04:12.400
 implementation is it's worth it because coronavirus is the most dangerous thing

0:04:12.400 --> 0:04:16.760
 we've ever experienced in our lifetime. Yeah that really is if people should

0:04:16.760 --> 0:04:21.800
 just start looking at some of the facts. Have you heard any of Norman Fenton's

0:04:21.800 --> 0:04:27.000
 no talks about these statistics. He's a professor at

0:04:27.000 --> 0:04:34.480
 Queen's University in London, statistical practical questions, and all of

0:04:34.480 --> 0:04:40.520
 his papers used to be published until he decided to look at the actual figures

0:04:40.520 --> 0:04:47.360
 for mortality and what the virus is doing. And any time you look at the actual

0:04:47.360 --> 0:04:57.640
 deaths from the so-called pandemic, what they did was simply rename influenza and several

0:04:57.640 --> 0:05:08.240
 other major causes of seasonal death, simply renamed them COVID, and it had the miraculous effect of ending

0:05:08.240 --> 0:05:13.280
 death from influenza around the world for a couple of years.

0:05:13.280 --> 0:05:22.440
 But essentially, just looking at the one or two weeks figures for when there's a gigantic

0:05:22.440 --> 0:05:29.040
 surge in deaths from COVID, there's a gigantic disappearance of deaths from influenza.

0:05:29.040 --> 0:05:32.640
 Just looking at that one fact coming out of the CDC

0:05:32.640 --> 0:05:35.640
 and other government agencies,

0:05:35.640 --> 0:05:37.520
 the only thing you can conclude is

0:05:39.640 --> 0:05:42.280
 never was a COVID pandemic.

0:05:42.280 --> 0:05:47.920
 People have had coronavirus colds hundreds of years and that's all it is. It's

0:05:48.720 --> 0:05:56.800
 renaming any respiratory-related sickness and even all sorts of other things as COVID just to

0:05:57.360 --> 0:06:02.080
 create panic. So I'm starting to question even the influenza. How did they know before in the

0:06:02.080 --> 0:06:07.200
 past when we had the 60 to 80,000 deaths in the United States from the flu, how did they know before in the past when we had the 60 to 80 thousand deaths in the United States from the flu, how did they know

0:06:07.200 --> 0:06:10.080
 these were from the flu? They didn't test them with the PCR test?

0:06:10.080 --> 0:06:18.600
 Yeah, just a few years ago people asked that question and the CDC said well it

0:06:18.600 --> 0:06:27.840
 might not have really been 60,000 deaths this year, but it was at least 1,200 caused by the influenza virus.

0:06:28.960 --> 0:06:32.320
 Well, how about we call them iatrogenic deaths? Because one thing is certain,

0:06:32.320 --> 0:06:34.400
 these people died in the hospitals, right? Yeah.

0:06:34.400 --> 0:06:39.760
 So maybe that's all it is. Every year, we have at least 60 to 80,000 people dying in the hospital,

0:06:39.760 --> 0:06:44.400
 showing up with respiratory symptoms, but ultimately they died in the care of these

0:06:44.400 --> 0:06:45.480
 doctors. I mean, I don't know of many people they died in the care of these doctors.

0:06:45.480 --> 0:06:48.160
 I mean, I don't know of many people who died from the flu at home.

0:06:48.160 --> 0:06:49.160
 Yeah.

0:06:49.160 --> 0:06:56.960
 And once you see the terrible emptiness of the government figures regarding coronavirus,

0:06:56.960 --> 0:07:01.000
 that might make you wonder, what about the other vaccines?

0:07:01.000 --> 0:07:09.240
 Did the polio vaccine really cure polio, or did suddenly polio disappear to be replaced

0:07:09.240 --> 0:07:19.320
 by almost identical numbers of Guillain-BarrÃ© paralysis and other paralytic diseases?

0:07:19.320 --> 0:07:26.080
 The vaccine cured the named paralysis but didn't cure the incidence of paralytic disease.

0:07:26.080 --> 0:07:30.880
 Do you think this Kien-BiarrÃ© syndrome has its origin in the gastrointestinal tract,

0:07:30.880 --> 0:07:33.040
 some kind of inflammatory reaction there?

0:07:33.040 --> 0:07:52.480
 Yeah, the poliovirus and all of the 30s, a gastroenterologist was experimenting with distemper in dogs and

0:07:52.480 --> 0:07:57.680
 he could give them an infection and then cut them open and see what was happening.

0:07:57.680 --> 0:08:07.120
 And in the early stages of the distemper sickness where they classified it as a respiratory disease.

0:08:07.120 --> 0:08:13.640
 All that was happening was virus infection of the intestine and reflexes from the intestine

0:08:13.640 --> 0:08:20.120
 were causing the respiratory symptoms but the respiratory tissues were absolutely free

0:08:20.120 --> 0:08:26.480
 of virus at the peak of the disease, it was all intestinal infection causing reflex

0:08:26.480 --> 0:08:30.840
 inflammation of the lungs and respiratory system.

0:08:30.840 --> 0:08:35.360
 And that seems to be how a lot of the viruses work.

0:08:35.360 --> 0:08:42.640
 They first make your intestine permeable to bacteria and toxins and then it's the sepsis

0:08:42.640 --> 0:08:48.680
 that triggers the inflammatory cytokine storm sort of thing.

0:08:48.680 --> 0:08:54.200
 So this reflux pneumonia which they prepare for during surgery, they give people anti-acid

0:08:54.200 --> 0:08:58.880
 drugs so basically we're seeing that in all of the, you're saying we're seeing this in

0:08:58.880 --> 0:09:02.040
 the other paralytic conditions, it can happen even without surgery?

0:09:02.040 --> 0:09:03.040
 Can happen without.

0:09:03.040 --> 0:09:07.000
 So when people lie on the operating table, they usually before that they give them these

0:09:07.000 --> 0:09:11.360
 strong anti-acid drugs because they're afraid that they're going to reflux and it's going

0:09:11.360 --> 0:09:13.520
 to get into their lungs and cause pneumonia.

0:09:13.520 --> 0:09:16.720
 But you're saying that we can have this even without the surgery?

0:09:16.720 --> 0:09:28.120
 Yeah, there have been some very clear studies in which people who recover slowly from surgery or who die following complications

0:09:28.120 --> 0:09:34.680
 after surgery, what's happening is the stress of the surgery made their intestine permeable

0:09:34.680 --> 0:09:40.800
 to the toxins that are not being suppressed by active digestion.

0:09:40.800 --> 0:09:45.880
 And if they clean their intestine for two or three days thoroughly with antibiotics

0:09:45.880 --> 0:09:52.840
 before going into surgery, just about 100% of them have no surgical stress complications

0:09:52.840 --> 0:09:53.840
 following the cutting.

0:09:53.840 --> 0:09:59.160
 So I guess it would be a good regimen if somebody's about to have surgery, even if it's not abdominal,

0:09:59.160 --> 0:10:03.120
 if it's going to be a long-time surgery, just sterilize the intestine anyways.

0:10:03.120 --> 0:10:08.160
 Yeah, even if the doctors aren't, if they don't read the literature, the person should

0:10:08.160 --> 0:10:16.000
 take laxatives and make sure their hormones are good, have a very fibrous diet for several

0:10:16.000 --> 0:10:20.040
 days before surgery, get a clean flow going through.

0:10:20.040 --> 0:10:22.720
 Speaking of fiber, I actually wanted to talk about oat bran.

0:10:22.720 --> 0:10:28.400
 And so a long time ago, you know, somebody asked you, like, what were the safest grains? And I think you said mazahirana

0:10:28.400 --> 0:10:33.400
 oats and maybe one other thing I can't remember. But is you using oat bran? Is that more of

0:10:33.400 --> 0:10:38.040
 an intestinal disinfectant or is it a source of carbohydrate for you?

0:10:38.040 --> 0:10:47.240
 The oat bran, I read that a cup of the cooked stuff, it's fairly filling and so a cup is a big serving

0:10:47.240 --> 0:10:54.120
 but it has only 88 calories for regular oatmeal as maybe 250 or so for the same

0:10:54.120 --> 0:10:59.800
 thing. So it does provide some carbohydrates but it's strongly buffered

0:10:59.800 --> 0:11:07.960
 by the presence of a higher fiber content and studies in animals showed that over a

0:11:07.960 --> 0:11:17.200
 long run, you might have to worry about some of the breakdown products of the soluble fibers

0:11:17.200 --> 0:11:28.140
 that can have an estrogenic effect but in the short run, up to a year or so, its effect is a matter of the bulk and acceleration

0:11:28.140 --> 0:11:31.800
 of the intestines, so it has an anti-estrogen effect

0:11:31.800 --> 0:11:35.520
 for people who have been reabsorbing the estrogen

0:11:35.520 --> 0:11:37.480
 that their liver tries to excrete.

0:11:37.480 --> 0:11:40.320
 So would you still use the carrot

0:11:40.320 --> 0:11:43.760
 when you had a O'Brien in the morning or something?

0:11:43.760 --> 0:11:47.800
 Yeah, and for someone, occasionally someone

0:11:47.800 --> 0:11:51.040
 has an oversensitive intestine

0:11:51.040 --> 0:11:55.620
 and the carrot is too powerfully stimulating

0:11:55.620 --> 0:12:00.620
 and can cause a headache or diarrhea

0:12:00.720 --> 0:12:03.600
 or other intestinal reactions.

0:12:03.600 --> 0:12:09.120
 So the oat bran is milder. Mushrooms are

0:12:09.120 --> 0:12:15.560
 sort of in between. It depends on how you, if you grind them or chop them fairly

0:12:15.560 --> 0:12:29.040
 fine, they are an effective but fairly mild fiber. Bamboo shoots are very, very high fiber content. So a little of it has

0:12:29.040 --> 0:12:32.460
 a strong effect in helping to clean up your intestine.

0:12:32.460 --> 0:12:37.320
 I will say, opium as a breakfast, I really don't know much better than that.

0:12:37.320 --> 0:12:41.160
 It's so easy to make, it takes like a minute and even like a fourth a cup

0:12:41.160 --> 0:12:43.960
 seems really filling. So it's like...

0:12:43.960 --> 0:12:50.240
 Yeah, and if you put the right amount of butter and salt when you're cooking, it's really

0:12:50.240 --> 0:12:51.600
 extremely pleasant.

0:12:51.600 --> 0:12:52.880
 With milk.

0:12:52.880 --> 0:12:53.880
 Exactly.

0:12:53.880 --> 0:12:56.000
 Yeah, milk, butter and sugar.

0:12:56.000 --> 0:13:00.640
 And then, but you did mention, and the whole internet knows this, but it contains phytic

0:13:00.640 --> 0:13:02.940
 acid so you'd want to have more calcium.

0:13:02.940 --> 0:13:06.720
 Or if you made it with milk, do you think that would balance it out?

0:13:06.720 --> 0:13:11.920
 Some studies say that it just about negates the value of the milk you have with it.

0:13:11.920 --> 0:13:16.360
 So you probably have to eat extra milk more than you would think.

0:13:16.360 --> 0:13:20.240
 But two quarts of milk will take care of just about anything.

0:13:20.240 --> 0:13:24.200
 And then I think even a fourth of a cup might have had like 500 milligrams of phosphorus

0:13:24.200 --> 0:13:25.060
 in it, So that is

0:13:25.060 --> 0:13:28.620
 just adding to kind of the daily phosphorus intake. Yeah. So you

0:13:28.620 --> 0:13:31.880
 really need a lot of milk to balance it. Great stuff. And

0:13:31.880 --> 0:13:33.940
 Georgie interrupt me at any point in time. But you know, I

0:13:33.940 --> 0:13:37.280
 just moved into a new place. And I've been scanning my environment

0:13:37.280 --> 0:13:40.580
 for things that might be inflammatory or toxic. And so I

0:13:40.580 --> 0:13:44.240
 have some in IRA I emailed you about a bed, you know, because I

0:13:44.600 --> 0:13:45.460
 fingers crossed, I'm here for a bed, you know, because I, fingers crossed I'm here

0:13:45.460 --> 0:13:46.300
 for a long time.

0:13:46.300 --> 0:13:48.040
 But like just open question to you,

0:13:48.040 --> 0:13:49.800
 if you were to move into a house

0:13:49.800 --> 0:13:51.580
 with all the new technologies and things,

0:13:51.580 --> 0:13:53.520
 what do you think would be the first things

0:13:53.520 --> 0:13:57.480
 that you would deem as a huge problem and try to mitigate?

0:13:57.480 --> 0:14:01.120
 If it has computer stuff, I would wire,

0:14:01.120 --> 0:14:03.840
 they call it ethernet cable connections

0:14:03.840 --> 0:14:06.840
 between all of the parts instead of Wi-Fi.

0:14:06.840 --> 0:14:12.240
 And what about grounding equipment? So I've been spending lots of time with speaker wire

0:14:12.240 --> 0:14:17.200
 and taking the prongs out of plugs and wrapping them around and plugging them into grounds.

0:14:17.200 --> 0:14:20.520
 You think, so I have a bunch of equipment on the desk right now. Should I try or should

0:14:20.520 --> 0:14:27.200
 a person try to ground everything metal in their environment? Check if you have a field meter.

0:14:27.200 --> 0:14:31.480
 Check whether your monitor is putting out a big field.

0:14:33.120 --> 0:14:38.120
 My Macintosh monitor had a huge field

0:14:38.120 --> 0:14:42.320
 and was very hot, so I just bought a different monitor.

0:14:42.320 --> 0:14:48.560
 I have a grounding pad, but it didn't affect the Macintosh

0:14:48.560 --> 0:14:50.920
 monitor enough to bother with.

0:14:50.920 --> 0:14:55.880
 What's the more effective strategy, grounding every item and yourself, or is it more important

0:14:55.880 --> 0:14:58.480
 for yourself to be grounded, or what?

0:14:58.480 --> 0:15:07.000
 Only if it has big fields you're sure is reaching out two or three feet beyond the monitor or your keyboard.

0:15:07.000 --> 0:15:15.340
 But when you have things connected by the wires, your general environment is much reduced.

0:15:15.340 --> 0:15:19.200
 And then similar question, you mentioned maybe, I don't know, four or five years ago about

0:15:19.200 --> 0:15:23.600
 grounding a person's bed. Can you maybe explain that a little bit more if you think that's

0:15:23.600 --> 0:15:29.600
 something important? Probably going barefoot in Mexico the temperatures is

0:15:29.600 --> 0:15:37.640
 good enough that you can walk barefoot outside anytime you feel like it. And

0:15:37.640 --> 0:15:43.960
 even in town people are gonna look at you if you walk barefoot down the

0:15:43.960 --> 0:15:45.920
 sidewalk but there's no law against

0:15:45.920 --> 0:15:52.760
 it. And the daytime contact with the earth, I think, is enough to get you through the

0:15:52.760 --> 0:16:00.960
 night without grounding. But you can get sheets and bedding that have copper wires woven into

0:16:00.960 --> 0:16:08.200
 the fabric and a connection to put a wire to ground. And theoretically, that

0:16:08.200 --> 0:16:15.640
 protects you considerably from the, if you have 60 cycle or 50 cycle electricity in your

0:16:15.640 --> 0:16:16.640
 environment.

0:16:16.640 --> 0:16:20.740
 And what's like the bioenergetic perspective of being grounded? Like what, what exactly

0:16:20.740 --> 0:16:27.880
 does that even do? They talk about it as a sort of a buffer

0:16:28.520 --> 0:16:33.520
 to the electrons that are being produced metabolically.

0:16:33.960 --> 0:16:37.240
 And if you take a piece of skin,

0:16:37.240 --> 0:16:40.160
 people vary according to their metabolic rate

0:16:40.160 --> 0:16:41.200
 and thyroid function,

0:16:41.200 --> 0:16:46.160
 but you can put a piece of skin in the culture dish and it will keep

0:16:46.160 --> 0:16:52.000
 projecting a static field into the surrounding space.

0:16:52.000 --> 0:16:57.920
 If you put cyanide in the culture dish, stopping respiration, the electrical field collapses

0:16:57.920 --> 0:17:08.280
 and washing the cyanide out, the field comes back. And so people are in effect bristling with their own, it's

0:17:08.280 --> 0:17:18.700
 like a static field, an electret is what you call it when it's established in wax or plastic.

0:17:18.700 --> 0:17:29.580
 For a long time they had electret needles for phonograph pickups and instead of electromagnetic, it was a piece

0:17:29.580 --> 0:17:37.680
 of ceramic or plastic that had a static electrical field implanted in the plastic or ceramic

0:17:37.680 --> 0:17:47.560
 as it was hardening and that polarized system of electrons projects the field permanently so that if you vibrate that

0:17:47.560 --> 0:17:51.320
 piece of plastic, it creates an electrical current.

0:17:51.320 --> 0:17:55.920
 So it's just a variation on electromagnetic pickups.

0:17:55.920 --> 0:18:08.720
 But it's a very powerful phenomenon that if you're handling plastic bottles, for example, sometimes it will mess up the ability

0:18:08.720 --> 0:18:13.520
 to control the fluid that you want to get out of the bottle because the plastic has

0:18:13.520 --> 0:18:16.560
 such a strong electrical field built into it.

0:18:16.560 --> 0:18:26.360
 And we are being a soft, flexible material. material, we have to generate that structure and field momentarily by

0:18:26.360 --> 0:18:36.040
 respiring, and that in an isolated environment that could lead to influences

0:18:36.040 --> 0:18:42.000
 backwards from our environment to our metabolism. And supposedly if you ground

0:18:42.000 --> 0:18:47.360
 yourself, that keeps the extraneous charges from interfering

0:18:47.360 --> 0:18:52.680
 with your own biological generation of that electret-like static field.

0:18:52.680 --> 0:18:53.680
 Very interesting.

0:18:53.680 --> 0:18:58.560
 So instead of grounding yourself, wouldn't taking a hefty dosage of quinones like methylene

0:18:58.560 --> 0:19:01.400
 blue or vitamin K would have a similar effect?

0:19:01.400 --> 0:19:06.300
 That keeps you oxidizing it. That's protective internally,

0:19:06.300 --> 0:19:10.960
 but the grounding people emphasize that it's protective,

0:19:10.960 --> 0:19:13.200
 at least in some circumstances,

0:19:13.200 --> 0:19:17.000
 to make sure you aren't being surrounded

0:19:17.000 --> 0:19:20.240
 by the wrong kind of electrical charge.

0:19:20.240 --> 0:19:22.720
 Oh, this is from like, if you're submerged

0:19:22.720 --> 0:19:24.840
 in a static field because of electric devices

0:19:24.840 --> 0:19:25.300
 or things like that

0:19:25.300 --> 0:19:27.500
 That's that that's what the grounding protects from

0:19:27.500 --> 0:19:28.000
 Yeah

0:19:28.000 --> 0:19:31.840
 That was my next question because I I forgot what the experiment was but somebody on YouTube

0:19:31.920 --> 0:19:33.920
 Showed that when they were grounded

0:19:33.920 --> 0:19:38.700
 I can't remember how they did this but they showed that the EMF was less intense or something that and that

0:19:38.800 --> 0:19:42.040
 Made me more interested in it after hearing that. Yeah, I

0:19:43.120 --> 0:19:47.600
 repeated those experiments and You can see the change.

0:19:47.600 --> 0:19:52.600
 Your body, when I was doing electrical stimulation

0:19:52.840 --> 0:19:56.600
 experiments, I tried to set up things to detect

0:19:56.600 --> 0:20:01.080
 the internal electrical behavior of tissues and organisms,

0:20:01.080 --> 0:20:07.760
 but I found that putting a strong detector on my animal or my tissue

0:20:07.760 --> 0:20:17.200
 or myself, we got the rock music radio station. No matter what tissue we were

0:20:17.200 --> 0:20:27.000
 trying to examine, the radio station was so powerful it it was swamping all of the intrinsic biological signals.

0:20:27.000 --> 0:20:31.520
 That's like a low-level EMF device that you were using, right?

0:20:31.520 --> 0:20:32.520
 Yeah.

0:20:32.520 --> 0:20:34.640
 Yeah, so it's probably way worse now.

0:20:34.640 --> 0:20:35.640
 Yeah.

0:20:35.640 --> 0:20:48.920
 Before I ever supplemented thyroid, I think it was 1976 that I first decided to go ahead with my intuition because before that, I knew that

0:20:48.920 --> 0:20:56.160
 I had the hypothyroid signs, the classical things except that my metabolic rate was very

0:20:56.160 --> 0:20:57.160
 high.

0:20:57.160 --> 0:21:07.040
 Just at rest, I was burning about 4,000 calories and in a BMR test, I was two or three hundred percent above normal

0:21:07.040 --> 0:21:13.400
 oxygen consumption and that delayed me for several years from believing that I could

0:21:13.400 --> 0:21:14.400
 be hypothyroid.

0:21:14.400 --> 0:21:27.680
 But anyway, when I took thyroid, suddenly my metabolic energy went down towards normal but in the few years before I took thyroid, being around lab

0:21:27.680 --> 0:21:33.640
 instruments of various sorts, I was able to see that that high internal

0:21:33.640 --> 0:21:39.640
 metabolism was causing me to have extremely exaggerated projection of

0:21:39.640 --> 0:21:46.300
 charge fields around me. So that in lab where we had to use an electronic

0:21:46.300 --> 0:21:53.900
 stimulator to produce a certain voltage to stimulate cells, if I reached towards

0:21:53.900 --> 0:22:00.420
 it, got within the foot of it to adjust a knob, the machine would just suddenly run

0:22:00.420 --> 0:22:06.120
 off scale and go full force and as I pulled my hand away, it would go back

0:22:06.120 --> 0:22:12.240
 sort of like the theremin music instrument that you adjust the pitch

0:22:12.240 --> 0:22:18.080
 according to your position of your hand. But I had to always have my lab partner

0:22:18.080 --> 0:22:28.880
 operate the machine because my hand made it malfunction and anything electrical tended to be disturbed. Even a

0:22:29.840 --> 0:22:38.320
 cosmic ray cloud chamber, the ionization behavior of the humid atmosphere was cleared up

0:22:39.440 --> 0:22:45.280
 by this field that extended about a foot to a foot and a half beyond my body.

0:22:45.280 --> 0:22:49.900
 So the people who basically tend to get shocked very often for no apparent reason, is it fair

0:22:49.900 --> 0:22:54.820
 to say that they have very high rate of metabolism but the electrons are not getting paired properly

0:22:54.820 --> 0:22:57.880
 with oxygen so they build up and they sort of create this field?

0:22:57.880 --> 0:22:59.100
 Yeah, I think so.

0:22:59.100 --> 0:23:04.280
 So when you are taking thyroid, what happened, I mean I guess it lowered your stress hormones

0:23:04.280 --> 0:23:06.620
 so your metabolic rate went down?

0:23:06.620 --> 0:23:14.580
 Yeah, I've seen it in three or four other men about the same age and they're 30s usually

0:23:14.580 --> 0:23:19.060
 who no matter how much they ate couldn't put on weight.

0:23:19.060 --> 0:23:27.520
 They would often be 120 or 30 pounds for a standard height but if they took thyroid, suddenly their ability

0:23:27.520 --> 0:23:34.320
 to build muscle and fat with a normal amount of food was restored.

0:23:34.320 --> 0:23:41.560
 When you're hypothyroid, I think the mechanism is that your cells lose the ability to constantly

0:23:41.560 --> 0:23:48.120
 retain magnesium and so if the cells lose magnesium chronically,

0:23:48.120 --> 0:23:56.800
 they run their energy apparatus to the magnesium allows the ATP to accumulate and if you can't

0:23:56.800 --> 0:24:09.800
 accumulate the ATP, you have to make it constantly and the thyroid supplement I think is letting you retain the necessary magnesium to stabilize

0:24:09.800 --> 0:24:13.960
 the ATP so you can turn off the production periodically.

0:24:13.960 --> 0:24:19.840
 So these people basically have upper glycolysis to produce the necessary ATP through the less

0:24:19.840 --> 0:24:22.280
 efficient means if thyroid is not available.

0:24:22.280 --> 0:24:26.760
 Yeah and that's where the symptoms and deterioration come in.

0:24:26.760 --> 0:24:35.240
 So it's very wasteful of food to have that happen but it keeps things working very nicely.

0:24:35.240 --> 0:24:38.320
 What about the people who put on weight too easily?

0:24:38.320 --> 0:24:40.040
 What's the explanation there?

0:24:40.040 --> 0:24:42.080
 Again in terms of low thyroid or?

0:24:42.080 --> 0:24:46.280
 Yeah, just low thyroid is not running the machine fast enough.

0:24:46.280 --> 0:24:51.080
 Who do you say is in a worse position, a person who puts on weight easily or cannot put on

0:24:51.080 --> 0:24:53.120
 weight no matter how much they eat?

0:24:53.120 --> 0:25:02.080
 The people I've known, like myself, were very energetic and healthy, but they just couldn't

0:25:02.080 --> 0:25:04.120
 put on weight no matter how much they eat.

0:25:04.120 --> 0:25:06.320
 Okay, but this is still stress metabolism, right?

0:25:06.320 --> 0:25:09.920
 Because thyroid wasn't functioning properly.

0:25:09.920 --> 0:25:14.920
 Well, it was as long as it was able to use the energy

0:25:15.360 --> 0:25:18.100
 and make ATP, it didn't have to resort

0:25:18.100 --> 0:25:21.040
 to other sources to make ATP.

0:25:21.040 --> 0:25:28.680
 So in those hypermetabolic states, there's not necessarily any glycolysis going on.

0:25:28.680 --> 0:25:34.000
 And what was keeping your metabolic rate so high if thyroid wasn't optimal?

0:25:34.000 --> 0:25:50.040
 I think a diet that was heavy on phosphate, not enough calcium and magnesium. People have experimented with the allergy patients found that the active thyroid hormone

0:25:50.040 --> 0:25:56.680
 let you retain magnesium if you were given it but without the T3, you could put the magnesium

0:25:56.680 --> 0:26:11.760
 in and they would work perfectly for a few days and then they would lose the magnesium. So taking a supplement of magnesium can temporarily moderate your metabolism so you don't have

0:26:11.760 --> 0:26:14.920
 that hyper metabolic reaction to low thyroid.

0:26:14.920 --> 0:26:19.880
 But you have to keep taking it over and over because you lose it quickly without the ATP?

0:26:19.880 --> 0:26:20.880
 Yeah.

0:26:20.880 --> 0:26:28.000
 The doctors experimenting on their patients found that just one or two intravenous doses

0:26:28.000 --> 0:26:37.800
 was enough to work for a week, but then they could take it orally and keep their magnesium

0:26:37.800 --> 0:26:39.500
 up and their allergies down.

0:26:39.500 --> 0:26:42.520
 Maybe you mentioned a few years ago, with good thyroid function, you could even get,

0:26:42.520 --> 0:26:47.040
 I don't know, what was it, like 200 milligrams of magnesium that would be sufficient like some people on the internet take like a

0:26:47.040 --> 0:26:53.840
 thousand or two thousand milligrams every day? Yeah the body when it's deficient can suck up

0:26:53.840 --> 0:27:00.640
 and retain a fairly modest amount from your food supply but if your thyroid is low then

0:27:01.280 --> 0:27:06.080
 you have to worry about the constant supply of generous magnesium.

0:27:06.080 --> 0:27:10.720
 So in keeping, thanks for that, in keeping with our anti-non-toxic, anti-inflammatory

0:27:10.720 --> 0:27:17.640
 home, probably, I don't know, was it 2018, I emailed you about a home air purifier and

0:27:17.640 --> 0:27:21.920
 you told me you had the Mystic Marvels device and so I immediately bought that and experimented

0:27:21.920 --> 0:27:26.480
 with it. And so that's, one, like what is a negative ion generator and why is it useful?

0:27:26.480 --> 0:27:35.760
 The majority of the careful studies have found that the serotonin disposition is increased

0:27:35.760 --> 0:27:48.220
 immediately by negative ions in the air in particular because the lungs are the main, the liver does it but the lungs have the first

0:27:48.220 --> 0:27:55.760
 access to the circulating platelets carrying serotonin produced by stress and irritation

0:27:55.760 --> 0:27:57.280
 inflammation.

0:27:57.280 --> 0:28:07.080
 So if your lungs need a boost of energy to detoxify that circulating stress-related serotonin. The electrons

0:28:07.080 --> 0:28:15.160
 delivered on error ions participate directly in the monoamino oxidase

0:28:15.160 --> 0:28:21.720
 reaction to eliminate it. And some of the studies show that the blood level of

0:28:21.720 --> 0:28:28.080
 serotonin is decreased as you have more ionized negative air.

0:28:28.080 --> 0:28:31.920
 So just having that around you, especially in the evening time, like maybe next to your

0:28:31.920 --> 0:28:36.200
 bed would be a good way to not go extremely hypometabolic during the nighttime.

0:28:36.200 --> 0:28:37.200
 Yeah.

0:28:37.200 --> 0:28:38.200
 Amazing.

0:28:38.200 --> 0:28:39.200
 Okay.

0:28:39.200 --> 0:28:48.320
 I think very high altitude, the ultraviolet in the air is intense enough to give you a steady supply of negative ions.

0:28:48.320 --> 0:28:53.080
 Why do you think, some people email me studies showing that there's an increased risk of

0:28:53.080 --> 0:28:54.080
 suicide at altitude.

0:28:54.080 --> 0:28:57.040
 What do you think is responsible for that?

0:28:57.040 --> 0:29:03.320
 I looked at many of the countries around the world and that simply is a bad generalization.

0:29:03.320 --> 0:29:10.120
 It probably has to do with social economic conditions in Colorado, which they were looking at.

0:29:10.120 --> 0:29:23.520
 But when you look at Bangladesh and Tibet and Colombia and the low-lying Latin cultures,

0:29:23.520 --> 0:29:26.480
 there's absolutely no correlation.

0:29:26.480 --> 0:29:29.760
 In fact, the people living in the field have a much higher rate, right?

0:29:29.760 --> 0:29:37.600
 Yeah, generally the health is worse as your altitude is lower.

0:29:38.880 --> 0:29:50.080
 Every thousand feet of altitude where you live decreases heart disease, mortality, cancer, mortality, and

0:29:50.080 --> 0:29:51.080
 dementia.

0:29:51.080 --> 0:29:56.440
 You mentioned in some of your books about the extreme longevity in places like Azerbaijan

0:29:56.440 --> 0:29:59.640
 and like the Caucasus Mountains.

0:29:59.640 --> 0:30:03.540
 And there is this guy, I think his last name is Muslimov.

0:30:03.540 --> 0:30:06.240
 He used to he lived in the former Soviet Union.

0:30:06.240 --> 0:30:12.640
 He was an Azeri guy who had a passport showing that he was 160 some years old when he actually died.

0:30:12.640 --> 0:30:20.400
 I mean the altitude there is high, but it's not that high. He lived at an altitude of about 1800 meters.

0:30:20.400 --> 0:30:25.260
 So why, I mean, do you think there are studies that, have you seen studies that show that

0:30:25.260 --> 0:30:29.220
 even higher altitude like in the Himalayas for example the Sherpas that live there at

0:30:29.220 --> 0:30:31.900
 much higher altitude, are they living on average longer?

0:30:31.900 --> 0:30:38.500
 All the figures I've seen show that cancer and heart disease are consistently lower the

0:30:38.500 --> 0:30:44.100
 higher you live and osteoporosis is something very directly connected.

0:30:44.100 --> 0:30:47.000
 Your bones get stronger and teeth stay in longer.

0:30:47.000 --> 0:30:49.880
 So the altitude, I guess, is half of it and the other half is diet,

0:30:49.880 --> 0:30:53.840
 because that guy who lived to 168 ate mostly milk and a little bit of bread.

0:30:53.840 --> 0:31:00.720
 Yeah, that area, the dairy area, they got plenty of milk and cheese.

0:31:00.720 --> 0:31:04.120
 Yeah, he got married at the age of 140 and had children, apparently.

0:31:04.880 --> 0:31:05.000
 Azerbaijan is, you've mentioned them frequently, right? Yeah, he got married at the age of 140 and had children, apparently.

0:31:05.000 --> 0:31:07.840
 Azerbaijan is, you've mentioned them frequently, right?

0:31:07.840 --> 0:31:10.640
 They have, like, kind of the foods you recommend, isn't that right?

0:31:10.640 --> 0:31:11.640
 Like, historically?

0:31:11.640 --> 0:31:13.640
 Yeah, I've seen pictures of their meals.

0:31:13.640 --> 0:31:16.000
 They look very delicious.

0:31:16.000 --> 0:31:18.000
 Did you go there when you visited the Soviet Union?

0:31:18.000 --> 0:31:19.000
 No.

0:31:19.000 --> 0:31:20.000
 Amazing.

0:31:20.000 --> 0:31:21.000
 Okay, we'll give Ray a break here.

0:31:21.000 --> 0:31:22.000
 Let me do a little advertisement.

0:31:22.000 --> 0:31:23.560
 So the newsletter is available by email now.

0:31:23.560 --> 0:31:25.900
 It's $28, which can be paid through PayPal

0:31:25.900 --> 0:31:27.540
 to raypeatsnewsletter at gmail.com.

0:31:27.540 --> 0:31:29.200
 And Ray, if I heard you correctly,

0:31:29.200 --> 0:31:31.320
 you switch to how many times a month?

0:31:31.320 --> 0:31:32.940
 Four, I'm sorry, how many times a year?

0:31:32.940 --> 0:31:33.900
 Four times?

0:31:33.900 --> 0:31:36.620
 Four times a year, more or less quarterly.

0:31:36.620 --> 0:31:41.420
 So instead of a two-year subscription

0:31:41.420 --> 0:31:47.880
 with 12 issues total, it's now three years for $30 or one year for

0:31:47.880 --> 0:31:52.400
 $10 for four issues. I should address this. That's amazing. I don't know

0:31:52.400 --> 0:31:56.600
 how you kept up with the two month schedule. I think I would have quit doing that after

0:31:56.600 --> 0:32:02.320
 maybe, I don't know, a month or two. It's really amazing. For the first 20 years I was doing it

0:32:02.320 --> 0:32:08.200
 every month. Then the next 20, 21 years I did it every other month.

0:32:08.200 --> 0:32:12.640
 But part of the thing was that a bimonthly subscription,

0:32:12.640 --> 0:32:15.840
 people were confused and thought their subscription

0:32:15.840 --> 0:32:19.360
 was for one year because it was 12 issues

0:32:19.360 --> 0:32:21.520
 or didn't know what bimonthly meant.

0:32:21.520 --> 0:32:23.760
 And so they were constantly causing

0:32:24.680 --> 0:32:26.480
 email questioning

0:32:26.480 --> 0:32:32.980
 that too much time. I just lost it it was $30 for three years what was it? No $10

0:32:32.980 --> 0:32:41.060
 per year. Okay. So for the 12 issues that used to be $28 and now it comes to $30.

0:32:41.060 --> 0:32:44.960
 Okay got it okay got it. Okay and then also you can get your amazing books

0:32:44.960 --> 0:32:47.240
 Generative Energy from PMS to Menopause,

0:32:47.240 --> 0:32:51.120
 Mind and Tissue, and Nutrition for Women by emailing raypeatsnewsletter at gmail.com.

0:32:51.120 --> 0:32:55.480
 And you can get them in digital and some of them are available in paperback, correct?

0:32:55.480 --> 0:32:57.360
 Ray Peats Yeah, several are still available.

0:32:57.360 --> 0:32:59.680
 Ryan Clements And then Progest-E from Keenogen, you can

0:32:59.680 --> 0:33:02.880
 email Catherine to purchase keenogen at gmail.com.

0:33:02.880 --> 0:33:06.100
 And each bottle of Progest-E contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone.

0:33:06.100 --> 0:33:08.480
 I just purchased 30 bottles, so thank you.

0:33:08.480 --> 0:33:10.360
 Ray, please tell Catherine I said thank you.

0:33:10.360 --> 0:33:11.880
 And then my plan is to mix that

0:33:11.880 --> 0:33:14.000
 with I purchased a lot of DHE from Bulk,

0:33:14.000 --> 0:33:15.680
 I think it was bulkpowder.com,

0:33:15.680 --> 0:33:17.120
 and I'll mix those together.

0:33:17.120 --> 0:33:21.000
 But Ray, any recent progesterone stories that you have?

0:33:21.000 --> 0:33:21.960
 No.

0:33:21.960 --> 0:33:24.120
 Do we talk about cycling the last time you were on?

0:33:24.120 --> 0:33:26.600
 How imperative that was for even

0:33:26.600 --> 0:33:27.600
 somebody...

0:33:27.600 --> 0:33:35.000
 For women, it's very important to the extent that their estrogen is still a problem, because

0:33:35.000 --> 0:33:42.080
 even small amounts of estrogen, if it's continuous and not interrupted, are carcinogenic eventually.

0:33:42.080 --> 0:33:45.520
 And so the cycling function of progesterone is to

0:33:45.520 --> 0:33:51.200
 thoroughly knock out the estrogen influence and let the tissue gather

0:33:51.200 --> 0:33:58.440
 itself together. It completely stops the estrogen cycle, carcinogenic cycle if

0:33:58.440 --> 0:34:08.000
 you interrupt it properly but when you take progesterone steadily without the interruption, your liver interprets

0:34:08.000 --> 0:34:16.400
 the constant high level of progesterone as being excessive and so anything your liver

0:34:16.400 --> 0:34:26.520
 experiences at a high level, it produces enzymes to excrete and so after two weeks, your liver has built up excretory enzymes

0:34:26.520 --> 0:34:29.200
 that inactivate the progesterone.

0:34:29.200 --> 0:34:36.840
 And so after two weeks, the effect of a given dose of progesterone is weaker and stopping

0:34:36.840 --> 0:34:44.600
 for at least a week lets your liver reset its threshold for excreting progesterone so

0:34:44.600 --> 0:34:46.200
 you get more for your money.

0:34:46.200 --> 0:34:48.060
 A couple of questions here.

0:34:48.060 --> 0:34:53.000
 First of all, if progesterone being a catotoxic steroid, it increases the amount of cytochrome

0:34:53.000 --> 0:34:56.280
 P450, the amount that is synthesized.

0:34:56.280 --> 0:34:59.760
 Isn't that in general a very good thing because you're going to be able to detox quite a few

0:34:59.760 --> 0:35:03.560
 other substances even though that will also detox the progesterone faster?

0:35:03.560 --> 0:35:07.240
 Yeah, it does have a general cleaning up effect.

0:35:07.240 --> 0:35:14.880
 Okay and then as far as the actual acceleration of the detox, wouldn't it be less of a problem

0:35:14.880 --> 0:35:21.080
 if the person took it topically because the liver will get like, because it will avoid

0:35:21.080 --> 0:35:25.400
 the first pass metabolism, the liver will have to deal with smaller amounts

0:35:25.400 --> 0:35:27.960
 per unit of time, so it wouldn't upregulate it as much.

0:35:27.960 --> 0:35:31.440
 It doesn't get it on the first pass anyway.

0:35:31.440 --> 0:35:33.800
 That happens with some drugs.

0:35:33.800 --> 0:35:38.320
 Progesterone and vitamin E being perfectly soluble

0:35:38.320 --> 0:35:43.320
 in the chylomitrons bypasses the liver many passes

0:35:43.920 --> 0:35:48.600
 until it is all distributed into your fat tissue, your

0:35:48.600 --> 0:35:54.520
 brain and everywhere that takes it up. But the chitomitrons are privileged to pass through

0:35:54.520 --> 0:36:00.960
 the liver without giving up their progesterone. So there's no first pass effect when you take

0:36:00.960 --> 0:36:03.360
 a progesterone in vitamin E.

0:36:03.360 --> 0:36:07.280
 And when you told the pharmaceutical rep that, he was not very happy to hear that?

0:36:07.280 --> 0:36:10.000
 Because you're explaining your patent, right?

0:36:10.000 --> 0:36:13.680
 The pharmaceutical rep came to your house and he was talking about purchasing it, maybe?

0:36:13.680 --> 0:36:16.680
 That was DHEA, actually.

0:36:16.680 --> 0:36:24.440
 And I told him examples of how it worked for three hours or so all afternoon.

0:36:24.440 --> 0:36:26.880
 And he said, that's all very interesting,

0:36:26.880 --> 0:36:28.480
 but that's not a good drug.

0:36:29.800 --> 0:36:30.640
 I didn't know this.

0:36:30.640 --> 0:36:33.040
 You had the DHA was dissolved in the vitamin E

0:36:33.040 --> 0:36:34.520
 and that's, so that's something you had.

0:36:34.520 --> 0:36:35.840
 I thought they were always mixed together

0:36:35.840 --> 0:36:36.960
 that you were giving me.

0:36:36.960 --> 0:36:39.280
 No, it was a second patent two years later.

0:36:39.280 --> 0:36:40.120
 Oh, interesting.

0:36:40.120 --> 0:36:41.680
 I think it's a testosterone, DHA,

0:36:41.680 --> 0:36:43.280
 and progesterone and pregnenolone, right?

0:36:43.280 --> 0:36:47.480
 I noticed they were separate. DHEA was a separate patent.

0:36:47.480 --> 0:36:51.960
 Oh, because I think I saw something about testosterone in vitamin E from you.

0:36:51.960 --> 0:36:59.640
 Yeah, I used to distribute that especially for arthritis in either men or women and I

0:36:59.640 --> 0:37:06.360
 wanted it so I didn't have to mix it special for each one so I put a functional amount of all

0:37:06.360 --> 0:37:13.440
 of them so there wouldn't be far out of balance for either men or women and applying it topically

0:37:13.440 --> 0:37:17.320
 or orally it was extremely effective for knocking out arthritis.

0:37:17.320 --> 0:37:19.480
 Rick Was testosterone not a controlled substance

0:37:19.480 --> 0:37:20.480
 back in the day?

0:37:20.480 --> 0:37:25.720
 I mean did FDA clamp down like like, started really regulating it recently?

0:37:25.720 --> 0:37:27.720
 Yeah, they got worse and worse.

0:37:27.720 --> 0:37:32.060
 Wow. Speaking of vitamin E, I've been meaning to ask you this for like 10 episodes now,

0:37:32.060 --> 0:37:50.760
 but what is the vitamin K itself and things I extracted from

0:37:50.760 --> 0:37:59.800
 liver and various quinones and putting them together, they formed a blackish-green, apparently

0:37:59.800 --> 0:38:08.320
 an oxidation process but putting dark blackish-green oil onto a paper chromatograph as the

0:38:08.320 --> 0:38:15.080
 solvent moves up to paper, it separated them back into the normal vitamin K and vitamin

0:38:15.080 --> 0:38:22.880
 E colors showing there was only a charge transfer but that in the body if you have a charge

0:38:22.880 --> 0:38:25.820
 transfer circulating in your blood that

0:38:25.820 --> 0:38:30.920
 becomes extremely sensitive to environmental light effects. So if a

0:38:30.920 --> 0:38:33.760
 person's gonna take vitamin K or vitamin E they should take them away from each

0:38:33.760 --> 0:38:38.840
 other right? Yeah, somewhat. Or not get exposed to bright sunlight or light for

0:38:38.840 --> 0:38:45.120
 the next few hours. Is riboflavin also subject to the same restriction of vitamin B2?

0:38:45.120 --> 0:38:48.120
 Oh, it's anything.

0:38:48.120 --> 0:38:56.040
 Blue light or ultraviolet will destroy riboflavin and cause mutations and inflammation in your

0:38:56.040 --> 0:38:57.680
 tissues where it happens.

0:38:57.680 --> 0:39:01.960
 If you take a lot of riboflavin, you want to stay out of the sun for a while.

0:39:01.960 --> 0:39:09.560
 Have you seen the patents Pfizer filed on, they call called photodynamic therapy with methylene blue and red light? Yeah but

0:39:09.560 --> 0:39:14.880
 that's to kill viruses basically. They also claim, I mean they patented

0:39:14.880 --> 0:39:18.480
 specifically for cancer, they're saying instead of giving you toxic drugs that

0:39:18.480 --> 0:39:22.400
 increase reactive oxygen species, we're just going to give you methylene blue and

0:39:22.400 --> 0:39:28.160
 then irradiate you and that will achieve the same reactive oxygen species generation which I think is dangerous, right?

0:39:28.160 --> 0:39:32.560
 Yeah, it's the same as most chemotherapies.

0:39:32.560 --> 0:39:40.520
 They hope it's more specific to the cancer than to your brain cells but it always kills

0:39:40.520 --> 0:39:42.160
 a lot of your brain cells.

0:39:42.160 --> 0:39:45.920
 If someone were in this day and age, especially the COVID, if they're really afraid of the

0:39:45.920 --> 0:39:50.680
 virus and they think they have it, would like a controlled version of this, let's say just

0:39:50.680 --> 0:39:55.080
 a few milligrams of methylene blue and some red light, would that be a good therapy, antiviral

0:39:55.080 --> 0:39:56.080
 therapy?

0:39:56.080 --> 0:40:01.880
 Only good in the sense that it's less toxic than some other things, but I wouldn't recommend

0:40:01.880 --> 0:40:02.880
 it.

0:40:02.880 --> 0:40:04.480
 What about for things like disinfecting water?

0:40:04.480 --> 0:40:07.200
 Put some methylene blue and then irradiate with red light.

0:40:07.200 --> 0:40:08.040
 Would that work?

0:40:08.040 --> 0:40:12.320
 It probably would leave some residues in the water

0:40:12.320 --> 0:40:13.800
 that would be unpredictable.

0:40:13.800 --> 0:40:14.640
 Okay.

0:40:14.640 --> 0:40:16.640
 Last thing about the negative ion generator,

0:40:16.640 --> 0:40:19.600
 because that dude, the Mystic Marvels guy,

0:40:19.600 --> 0:40:20.860
 he doesn't sell them anymore.

0:40:20.860 --> 0:40:23.440
 And so a buddy of mine sent him an email

0:40:23.440 --> 0:40:32.540
 and he recommended the W E I N Wayne wine V 2500 high density ionic air purifier. Do you have any opinion on that? Have you ever heard of it before?

0:40:32.720 --> 0:40:40.240
 No, but I would trust that guy. Yeah. No, what he's talking about. Yeah. So he stopped making it. He said it was just too much work.

0:40:40.260 --> 0:40:47.440
 Didn't he also say people were buying them near the coast and I was breaking them and And so they would make it and then it would they break and then they'd want to return

0:40:47.440 --> 0:40:48.440
 them or something.

0:40:48.440 --> 0:40:52.140
 But yeah, so this is the one he recommended for anybody that's interested.

0:40:52.140 --> 0:40:55.560
 And then again, we're really hopping around here.

0:40:55.560 --> 0:40:59.900
 But a lot of people are, myself included, are confused about the variants.

0:40:59.900 --> 0:41:04.240
 And so I remember the thing I remember that David E. Martin said was the variants you

0:41:04.240 --> 0:41:09.440
 could like take the sequence of the coronavirus and just cut it off at different places and

0:41:09.440 --> 0:41:11.520
 boom you have a new variant.

0:41:11.520 --> 0:41:12.520
 What is actually going on here?

0:41:12.520 --> 0:41:15.720
 It's like obviously they're not just perfectly fine.

0:41:15.720 --> 0:41:23.400
 The CDC just recently told the FDA that it could discontinue the use of PCR because it's

0:41:23.400 --> 0:41:25.780
 meaningless. discontinue the use of PCR because it's meaningless but the people who have been

0:41:25.780 --> 0:41:32.280
 promoting it either were completely ignorant about what a PCR is. In fact, a

0:41:32.280 --> 0:41:41.100
 lot of supposedly confident people were. When you use it to identify RNA

0:41:41.100 --> 0:41:46.960
 such as coronavirus, you have to make DNA from the RNA before you can run

0:41:46.960 --> 0:41:57.360
 the PCR using the DNA replicase or polymerase. And so the full name for the method is reverse

0:41:57.360 --> 0:42:06.880
 transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. But for some reason, some people were calling it real-time PCR.

0:42:06.880 --> 0:42:12.080
 They thought it sounded like it was more effective or something, neglecting that

0:42:12.080 --> 0:42:19.140
 the RT refers to reverse transcriptase, which is an essential part of the

0:42:19.140 --> 0:42:30.840
 process. And almost no one advocating the test has any idea what goes on in multiplying the DNA

0:42:30.840 --> 0:42:33.200
 that you make from the RNA.

0:42:33.200 --> 0:42:49.680
 And it's a manufacturing process that depends on the particular little stretch of DNA that you choose to amplify and you choose a stretch of the DNA out of

0:42:49.680 --> 0:42:52.920
 whatever RNA you might have started with.

0:42:52.920 --> 0:42:59.240
 And so you have to trust that the RNA sample was actually meaningfully connected to the

0:42:59.240 --> 0:43:11.280
 virus, not to say anything about connected to the disease but connected to the virus and then that you chose a sequence to multiply and that in the process of

0:43:11.280 --> 0:43:17.940
 increasing the amount of RNA of that particular a bit of specimen that you

0:43:17.940 --> 0:43:25.880
 were actually replicating that DNA and not some random background material.

0:43:25.880 --> 0:43:34.880
 But they generally ran at 40 cycles where everyone recognized that beyond 25 cycles,

0:43:34.880 --> 0:43:38.480
 you were getting so many false positives, it was meaningless.

0:43:38.480 --> 0:43:48.440
 So there's nothing about the PCR test that has been used honestly, and it has very consistently been used fraudulently,

0:43:48.440 --> 0:43:51.960
 deliberately, by the government agencies

0:43:51.960 --> 0:43:54.200
 and a lot of their apologists.

0:43:54.200 --> 0:43:56.740
 But they, I mean, obviously Omicron and Delta,

0:43:56.740 --> 0:43:58.840
 these are just media, marketing campaigns.

0:43:58.840 --> 0:44:00.320
 Like these have, they can just create

0:44:00.320 --> 0:44:02.760
 an endless amount of variants

0:44:02.760 --> 0:44:05.060
 and then put them through the channels of marketing, right?

0:44:05.060 --> 0:44:05.900
 Right. Yeah.

0:44:05.900 --> 0:44:08.720
 Well, at what point a mutation creates a totally new,

0:44:08.720 --> 0:44:10.120
 what should I call it, family of viruses?

0:44:10.120 --> 0:44:12.160
 Can the coronavirus mutate to the point

0:44:12.160 --> 0:44:14.740
 where it becomes a completely different type,

0:44:14.740 --> 0:44:16.020
 like species of a virus?

0:44:16.020 --> 0:44:17.800
 It's no longer a coronavirus,

0:44:17.800 --> 0:44:20.740
 but let's say a rhinovirus or any other RNA virus?

0:44:20.740 --> 0:44:28.340
 Very unlikely, even under lab circumstances, it's hardly possible.

0:44:28.340 --> 0:44:32.280
 So many radical changes have to be done.

0:44:32.280 --> 0:44:36.400
 So wouldn't this mutation game eventually sort of like get exhausted?

0:44:36.400 --> 0:44:40.640
 Isn't that why we're starting to see this, now they're starting to hype up the avian

0:44:40.640 --> 0:44:52.220
 viruses, the swine flu again is propping up, maybe they're running out of options. The normal evolution of the virus is to get weaker and weaker and weaker, so it

0:44:52.220 --> 0:44:58.700
 has a better chance of surviving if it doesn't kill its host prematurely. And to

0:44:58.700 --> 0:45:07.280
 the extent that there is some knowledge about the Omicron version. It's very harmless, like a mild cold.

0:45:07.280 --> 0:45:10.720
 I heard you could get a myocarditis from the Omicron variant.

0:45:10.720 --> 0:45:11.720
 Is that true?

0:45:11.720 --> 0:45:16.880
 Yeah, you can get it from any virus.

0:45:16.880 --> 0:45:22.120
 Everything that they accuse the coronavirus of causing from these long COVID, like a heart

0:45:22.120 --> 0:45:24.040
 damage, lung damage, et cetera.

0:45:24.040 --> 0:45:26.000
 If you Google that with influenza,

0:45:26.000 --> 0:45:27.600
 you'll get at least 10 studies saying

0:45:27.600 --> 0:45:29.440
 that flu can cause it as well.

0:45:29.440 --> 0:45:33.760
 Yeah, I think long COVID is as questionable as short COVID.

0:45:33.760 --> 0:45:37.540
 Well, one last thing and then we can go into questions,

0:45:37.540 --> 0:45:39.920
 but medical nemesis Ivan Illich,

0:45:39.920 --> 0:45:41.680
 he says, modern medicine is a negation of health.

0:45:41.680 --> 0:45:43.560
 It isn't organized to serve human health,

0:45:43.560 --> 0:45:47.000
 but only itself as an institution. It makes more people sick than it heals. And this quote

0:45:47.000 --> 0:45:51.840
 was fresh in my mind after arguing with this guy, because arguing that English guy, arguing

0:45:51.840 --> 0:45:56.260
 the details with him was completely worthless, because if he didn't accept the foundation

0:45:56.260 --> 0:46:00.960
 that medical intervention was a long history of unscientific practices, we would never

0:46:00.960 --> 0:46:10.240
 get anywhere with talking about the details of anything. And so that, and again, all your work exemplifies that that is the big problem that these people have no,

0:46:10.240 --> 0:46:13.840
 maybe they do know what they're doing, but they're doing things in harmful ways to hurt people.

0:46:13.840 --> 0:46:18.320
 RKLMN Yeah, I've done some newsletters talking about the

0:46:19.120 --> 0:46:25.000
 events in American medicine in particular, starting around 1850,

0:46:25.080 --> 0:46:28.160
 when the American Medical Association

0:46:28.160 --> 0:46:30.320
 decided to take over the world.

0:46:31.680 --> 0:46:36.680
 They really were a very hostile group that wanted to,

0:46:38.200 --> 0:46:41.880
 racially, they saw herbalists

0:46:41.880 --> 0:46:49.360
 and other theories of healing, they saw them as inferior people.

0:46:49.360 --> 0:46:58.440
 Native Americans had some very effective techniques, but they connected it to racism.

0:46:58.440 --> 0:47:08.760
 Black people were excluded, and the practical medicine, a lot of it that had been brought from Africa, that was excluded.

0:47:08.760 --> 0:47:17.760
 And what was left was what has been called allopathic medicine, the use of a single chemical

0:47:17.760 --> 0:47:27.920
 to treat a single defined disease. defined disease and so it created an essentialist rather than an

0:47:27.920 --> 0:47:34.800
 environmentalist approach to disease and the treatment of it became a very

0:47:34.800 --> 0:47:42.200
 controllable one remedy for one disease and only the doctors were qualified to

0:47:42.200 --> 0:47:47.160
 name the disease and therefore to prescribe the one specific

0:47:47.160 --> 0:47:49.240
 chemical that would treat it.

0:47:49.240 --> 0:47:53.920
 A totally fraudulent, anti-scientific view from the ground up.

0:47:53.920 --> 0:47:58.040
 And the cures are worse than the disease, the burn, cut, poison strategies.

0:47:58.040 --> 0:48:06.400
 Yeah, and all that comes from the same essentialist thing that cancer is essentially not human material.

0:48:06.400 --> 0:48:12.500
 And all that can be done, because it has essentially changed its nature, is to kill it.

0:48:12.500 --> 0:48:26.440
 So the whole concept is to kill it, not to heal the person who happens to be producing that tumor. Sorry, go ahead. Just to refresh my memory of the centralism,

0:48:26.480 --> 0:48:29.800
 but that's like a immutable traits that can't change. Is that what that is?

0:48:30.440 --> 0:48:35.800
 Yeah, that a gene is immortal, that our properties,

0:48:35.840 --> 0:48:40.640
 our qualities are immortal, and they consist of the immortal genes.

0:48:41.440 --> 0:48:49.760
 Separate, something absolutely separate from our somatic cells, the germline, they created

0:48:49.760 --> 0:48:57.120
 an imaginary embryological history of developing the gonads.

0:48:57.120 --> 0:49:07.960
 They claimed to see something that can't be seen under the microscope, and until about the year 2000, biologists just absolutely

0:49:07.960 --> 0:49:19.160
 had complete faith in that cluster of assertions about immutability of traits, the Gregor Mendel

0:49:19.160 --> 0:49:29.040
 theory of inheritance, which was essentially designed to counter Darwin and Lamarck and

0:49:29.040 --> 0:49:35.340
 evolutionary thinking. Nothing evolves if you have eternal parts that are constantly

0:49:35.340 --> 0:49:36.840
 coming back in different proportions.

0:49:36.840 --> 0:49:41.400
 Thank you for that. We won't keep you too much longer, Ray. So just to do some Q&As

0:49:41.400 --> 0:49:45.560
 and Georgie, interrupt at any time. Okay, so our first question here is,

0:49:45.560 --> 0:49:48.080
 can you ask Ray, what is an electron?

0:49:48.080 --> 0:49:49.040
 What do they look like?

0:49:49.040 --> 0:49:50.080
 What are they made of?

0:49:51.320 --> 0:49:56.320
 That's something that a good chemistry professor

0:49:56.520 --> 0:50:00.400
 or biologist might actually consider.

0:50:00.400 --> 0:50:08.720
 But the physics establishment insists that it's a matter of a verbal set of

0:50:08.720 --> 0:50:18.360
 definitions and they won't tolerate such questions as how to imagine in a

0:50:18.360 --> 0:50:26.560
 realistic way what is an electron and what is it doing and how does it do it and what does resonance

0:50:26.560 --> 0:50:27.560
 mean?

0:50:27.560 --> 0:50:39.360
 They say resonance is a matter between an electron and a nucleus and if you absorb energy

0:50:39.360 --> 0:50:44.120
 from the environment or give it back, it's a matter of changing the relation between

0:50:44.120 --> 0:50:45.880
 the electron and the

0:50:45.880 --> 0:50:55.480
 nucleus. They don't want to have any images of how the wave front of an electromagnetic

0:50:55.480 --> 0:51:08.700
 field approaching the nucleus and the electron, what happens at that interaction. It's sort of an all-or-nothing. You have to

0:51:08.700 --> 0:51:13.380
 accept your definition and not think very much about it because when you

0:51:13.380 --> 0:51:19.300
 think about it and actually do experiments, you violate their essential

0:51:19.300 --> 0:51:31.760
 definitions. For example, a German researcher, Helmut Schultz, I think his name was, put a laser beam horizontally

0:51:31.760 --> 0:51:40.320
 through a thin crystal, inserted in the electron beam of an electron microscope, and an inert,

0:51:40.320 --> 0:51:46.760
 I think aluminum oxide field for the electrons to hit, no film or phosphor.

0:51:46.760 --> 0:51:52.680
 So the electrons hitting the field shouldn't have done anything visible.

0:51:52.680 --> 0:51:59.640
 But the color of laser going perpendicular really through the crystal added a resonant

0:51:59.640 --> 0:52:07.680
 frequency to supposedly a beam of pure electrons and an electron supposedly resonates

0:52:07.680 --> 0:52:14.000
 only with reference to its nucleus but the beam coming through the crystal in

0:52:14.000 --> 0:52:21.840
 this experiment broke up into blue spots on the inert target area, showing that

0:52:21.840 --> 0:52:28.680
 the laser energy was being absorbed by the electron itself, not an atom

0:52:28.680 --> 0:52:36.960
 electron system, but the electron itself hitting a target somehow released the energy that

0:52:36.960 --> 0:52:39.960
 it had resonated with.

0:52:39.960 --> 0:52:48.560
 That has been repeated, the experiment has been done different times and it represents something

0:52:48.560 --> 0:52:55.800
 true about reality but it totally undermines the whole official physics doctrine about

0:52:55.800 --> 0:52:56.800
 what an electron is.

0:52:56.800 --> 0:53:00.560
 So is an electron essentially a standing wave in the neutrino sea?

0:53:00.560 --> 0:53:07.960
 Yeah, yeah, it's whatever that means. Well, I mean, well, it's a wave, it's a wave object,

0:53:07.960 --> 0:53:12.880
 if you if you can call it that. It's not a point like particle, which is what they call

0:53:12.880 --> 0:53:19.920
 it. And the neutrino sea itself is... Is waves. Yeah, hard, hard to visualize. Great stuff.

0:53:19.920 --> 0:53:24.120
 Thank you for that. Okay. Can you ask him if he has heard of Walter Kilner? And if so,

0:53:24.120 --> 0:53:29.220
 what he thinks about his use of di-cyanin to observe the observe the human aura?

0:53:29.220 --> 0:53:30.740
 I haven't heard of it.

0:53:30.740 --> 0:53:35.520
 Can you comment on the aura? Is that just an extension of like field theory or these

0:53:35.520 --> 0:53:36.700
 bioelectric fields around us?

0:53:36.700 --> 0:53:48.480
 I suspect that people are actually seeing that field. At the time, I was having my very intense electrical fields. A psychic

0:53:48.480 --> 0:53:55.360
 that I didn't know but was visiting, a roommate, told my roommate that I had a

0:53:55.360 --> 0:54:06.320
 very weird aura. When she went through the room, she seemed to be cringing, like there was avoiding heat coming off me or something.

0:54:06.320 --> 0:54:09.760
 That's what Aphrodite noticed. That's why you guys had such a good connection.

0:54:09.760 --> 0:54:10.760
 Yeah.

0:54:10.760 --> 0:54:16.400
 Could it be a projection of the hologram that the brain creates of reality as a model inside

0:54:16.400 --> 0:54:19.320
 the organism? So it just extends just a little bit outside of the body.

0:54:19.320 --> 0:54:24.480
 Yeah, yeah. I think other organisms can tune in and get the picture.

0:54:24.480 --> 0:54:26.800
 Okay, what does Ray see in his mind

0:54:26.800 --> 0:54:28.200
 when he thinks of the cell?

0:54:28.200 --> 0:54:32.120
 A series of things, cells that I have seen.

0:54:32.120 --> 0:54:35.480
 Well, like those new elaborate kind of digital images

0:54:35.480 --> 0:54:38.000
 where they're all like, looks like something,

0:54:38.000 --> 0:54:39.360
 somebody threw something against the wall

0:54:39.360 --> 0:54:40.520
 and it's kind of like a spatter thing.

0:54:40.520 --> 0:54:41.840
 Is that the image that you have?

0:54:41.840 --> 0:54:44.920
 No, I think of them as little personalities.

0:54:44.920 --> 0:54:50.560
 What, like, how do you explain the discrepancy of thinking of them as these round things

0:54:50.560 --> 0:54:54.600
 and then those new photos of them being kind of these scatter things? Or are both of those

0:54:54.600 --> 0:54:55.920
 incorrect interpretations?

0:54:55.920 --> 0:55:06.040
 Yeah, each cell has its field and like Ortega-Gasset said of a person that I am, I am, my

0:55:06.040 --> 0:55:11.720
 circumstance, the cell is in the same situation as a person

0:55:12.720 --> 0:55:18.480
 itself and its circumstance are identical. So as soon as the

0:55:18.480 --> 0:55:21.880
 circumstance changes, the cell is no longer what it was.

0:55:21.920 --> 0:55:24.600
 Appreciate that, Georgie, interrupt anytime. Can Dr. Pete

0:55:24.600 --> 0:55:26.600
 elaborate on a bioenergetic view

0:55:26.600 --> 0:55:29.080
 of sex determination during embryonic development?

0:55:29.080 --> 0:55:30.920
 Would the mother's hormonal environment

0:55:30.920 --> 0:55:32.480
 play a big role in the process?

0:55:32.480 --> 0:55:34.960
 Yeah, yeah, temperature, hormones,

0:55:34.960 --> 0:55:36.800
 stress hormones in particular,

0:55:37.840 --> 0:55:42.840
 in fish and reptiles and birds even,

0:55:42.920 --> 0:55:48.000
 the temperature is very essential to developing the ratio.

0:55:48.000 --> 0:55:54.000
 So it depends on temperature, right? Like alligators, when they lay eggs, if it's hot, it's mostly males?

0:55:54.000 --> 0:56:08.440
 Yeah, and chickens, the same thing. Early in the season, I forget which way it is, but it's a balance that's beneficial to have lots of females relative

0:56:08.440 --> 0:56:12.680
 to males when conditions are going to be optimal.

0:56:12.680 --> 0:56:17.840
 Do you think the high ratio of females to males, do you think that's nature's essentially

0:56:17.840 --> 0:56:20.160
 protective mechanism to the species?

0:56:20.160 --> 0:56:23.960
 I mean, protecting the species from disappearing if the environment is not good, it's better

0:56:23.960 --> 0:56:25.600
 to have more females than males,

0:56:25.600 --> 0:56:28.880
 because one male can essentially ensure the continuation,

0:56:28.880 --> 0:56:31.140
 but if you have equal amount or more males,

0:56:31.140 --> 0:56:32.880
 it becomes more difficult to reproduce.

0:56:32.880 --> 0:56:34.480
 Yeah, I think so.

0:56:34.480 --> 0:56:35.720
 Okay, another one here.

0:56:35.720 --> 0:56:38.600
 So as an extension, the recent statistics

0:56:38.600 --> 0:56:40.200
 that we're seeing all over the world,

0:56:40.200 --> 0:56:42.240
 that a lot more girls are being born,

0:56:42.240 --> 0:56:43.840
 aside from endocrine disruptors

0:56:43.840 --> 0:56:45.200
 that are known to be estrogenic,

0:56:45.200 --> 0:56:46.160
 and that can cause it,

0:56:46.160 --> 0:56:48.320
 could it also be a sign that the conditions

0:56:48.320 --> 0:56:50.040
 are deteriorating in our environment

0:56:50.040 --> 0:56:53.280
 and the human race basically is producing more women

0:56:53.280 --> 0:56:55.120
 in order to have a higher chance of survival?

0:56:55.120 --> 0:56:56.600
 That sounds very reasonable.

0:56:56.600 --> 0:56:57.440
 You just reminded me of something.

0:56:57.440 --> 0:57:01.720
 That IQ drop of kids that were born in 2020,

0:57:01.720 --> 0:57:04.120
 is this gonna result in a profoundly stupid society

0:57:04.120 --> 0:57:05.600
 in the next 10, 20 years?

0:57:12.400 --> 0:57:21.760
 Yeah, there was a... Have you read Ernest Sternglass's books or articles? He studied the effects of radiation on miscarriages and the ratio of boys surviving and so on. And

0:57:27.120 --> 0:57:37.520
 boys surviving and so on. And he shows that at the peak atmospheric contamination from the 1963 bomb competition, atmospheric testing of nuclear bombs, 18 years later, the academic

0:57:37.520 --> 0:57:49.440
 scores of all sorts, the, what's the standard exam that high school... Anyway, the average score went down and the

0:57:49.440 --> 0:57:56.800
 genetic people said that's because more poor people are taking the test. But he showed

0:57:56.800 --> 0:58:05.000
 very clearly that looking at just the highest scoring portion of the population,

0:58:05.680 --> 0:58:08.000
 that the greatest decrease,

0:58:08.960 --> 0:58:12.140
 18 years after the radiation peak,

0:58:12.140 --> 0:58:15.920
 the greatest decrease was in the highest scoring category.

0:58:15.920 --> 0:58:17.800
 So it lowered the average,

0:58:17.800 --> 0:58:20.760
 but it even more drastically knocked out

0:58:20.760 --> 0:58:25.000
 the exceptionally competent kids of that age.

0:58:25.620 --> 0:58:28.180
 You've read about the, they call it the Flynn effect, right?

0:58:28.180 --> 0:58:31.180
 The rising IQ scores throughout most of the 20th century,

0:58:31.180 --> 0:58:33.020
 then in the 90s, they plateaued,

0:58:33.020 --> 0:58:36.100
 and after 2000, they've been steadily dropping.

0:58:36.100 --> 0:58:39.700
 Yeah, even though some countries show lately

0:58:39.700 --> 0:58:44.300
 that the ratio of the brain to the body weight and height

0:58:44.300 --> 0:58:46.440
 has decreased in several countries.

0:58:46.440 --> 0:58:47.280
 And that's not even-

0:58:47.280 --> 0:58:48.960
 Were these developed countries or-

0:58:50.040 --> 0:58:52.040
 Yeah, Germany was one of them.

0:58:52.040 --> 0:58:52.880
 Oh, wow.

0:58:52.880 --> 0:58:56.160
 Not even accounting for the indefinite mRNA vaccines

0:58:56.160 --> 0:58:57.440
 these kids are gonna have to deal with.

0:58:57.440 --> 0:58:58.760
 Okay, here's another one.

0:58:58.760 --> 0:59:00.480
 Are Sheldrake's morphic fields

0:59:00.480 --> 0:59:02.960
 and Vernadsky's noosphere the same thing?

0:59:02.960 --> 0:59:04.720
 Yeah, they could be.

0:59:08.840 --> 0:59:31.000
 fields and Vernadsky's noosphere the of the ending of the Second World War.

0:59:31.000 --> 0:59:40.000
 He was surrounded by destruction and death, but he said he was confident that the world

0:59:40.000 --> 0:59:48.360
 would find a way out of it by increasing its metabolic rate, accumulating carbon dioxide, warming things up, making brains

0:59:48.360 --> 0:59:52.960
 get bigger, and making plants grow faster, everything working

0:59:52.960 --> 0:59:59.840
 more intensely. And the noosphere idea is the basic

0:59:59.840 --> 1:00:04.040
 thing that we're all headed in that direction, just because of

1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:05.680
 the nature of the universe.

1:00:05.680 --> 1:00:10.880
 Did Russian science incorporate, like, Vernadsky's geocosmic realism into their thinking?

1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:14.800
 Yeah, a large part of the establishment did.

1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:16.240
 Do you think he'sâoh, sorry, go ahead.

1:00:17.200 --> 1:00:29.380
 There were the dogmaticâI think of them as the Hegelian Marxists, the ones that thought the dialectic was some

1:00:29.380 --> 1:00:33.000
 mysterious thing.

1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:51.520
 But the average, intelligent, well-read Russian biologist and scientists in general have that sort of an emergence orientation that

1:00:51.520 --> 1:00:59.840
 it's part of the Marxist meaning of the dialectic, but it goes with an optimistic view of what

1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:01.440
 the cosmos is all about.

1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:02.440
 Amazing.

1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:03.440
 Thank you for that.

1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:04.440
 Give me a second here.

1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:06.980
 Okay. Ray has previously mentioned how our ruling class

1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:14.400
 Damaged are in the 20th century and highlighted the creation of Rockefeller ghost art if a counterculture painting movement was to start today

1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:20.700
 What themes styles or subjects would Ray like to see captured or communicated many? Thanks from Australia

1:01:20.700 --> 1:01:25.160
 I I think a little bit of the realism of Franz

1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:37.160
 Hals, the perceiving interesting things in people, anything that is a worthwhile insight

1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:45.000
 about the nature of people and their interactions. Franz Hals was very confident at capturing such things.

1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:49.540
 Yeah, but do you mention him in General of Energy in 1994?

1:01:49.540 --> 1:01:51.100
 You said that, what do you like,

1:01:51.100 --> 1:01:53.300
 it's like more alive, his paintings?

1:01:53.300 --> 1:01:55.680
 They were not just like a static, boring view of the person,

1:01:55.680 --> 1:01:58.140
 or they reflected something about their personality?

1:01:58.140 --> 1:02:02.340
 Yeah, he could perceive intensely enough

1:02:02.340 --> 1:02:08.880
 that he could capture instantaneous things that represented much more of

1:02:08.880 --> 1:02:13.680
 the person than a photograph would have. His paintings are, you can easily see that when

1:02:13.680 --> 1:02:18.560
 you're looking at his paintings. Okay. Okay, we'll wrap it up here very soon. Okay. Does

1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:23.440
 Ray think starch is responsible for a change in personality towards war and conquer that has caused

1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:25.600
 the atrocities since the beginning of agriculture?

1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:32.000
 It goes with malnutrition. The high starch diets end up

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:37.640
 tending to be deficient in some of the essential nutrients. High phosphate,

1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:43.760
 stress-inducing things that make people irritable and authoritarian.

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:45.000
 High serotonin outcome

1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:48.560
 of the inflammatory diet.

1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:50.560
 Great stuff, and Georgie, interrupt me at any point here.

1:02:50.560 --> 1:02:51.380
 Just a few more here.

1:02:51.380 --> 1:02:53.840
 Okay, what is the cost of getting drunk occasionally,

1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:57.080
 like blackout, passed out in the front yard, naked, drunk?

1:02:57.080 --> 1:03:00.080
 Like five times a year, not financially,

1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:02.640
 but like on your health and longevity?

1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:05.740
 I think it's very stressful to lose consciousness.

1:03:05.740 --> 1:03:09.300
 Maybe you told somebody in email a long time ago that it like greatly depletes

1:03:09.300 --> 1:03:12.380
 your liver glycogen and it would take multiple days to recover.

1:03:12.380 --> 1:03:14.180
 That's that's my experience.

1:03:14.180 --> 1:03:18.460
 Like drinking is never worth it because I'll feel so awful the next few days.

1:03:18.460 --> 1:03:22.080
 And so it just affects some people more than others

1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:24.300
 based on their ability to store liver glycogen, do you think?

1:03:24.540 --> 1:03:25.840
 Yeah, I think so.

1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:31.080
 Wouldn't taking a hefty dose of progesterone largely replicate the effects of getting drunk?

1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:38.360
 It increases your ability to store glycogen so it doesn't have any long-term negative

1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:46.380
 effects but when I accidentally overdose on it and the coordination of my hands and feet was

1:03:46.380 --> 1:03:51.400
 impossible for a while. But when I deliberately took a very large amount

1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:59.760
 because I had a bad migraine, I went with the euphoria, simply went to sleep in

1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:05.760
 about two minutes and had no more headache. But when it comes on accidentally and you

1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:10.440
 are hurt, you should be able to use your hands and feet.

1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:11.560
 It's embarrassing.

1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:14.240
 OK, let me see one more advertisement, then we'll close out the show here.

1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:17.880
 OK, so you can purchase Ray's newsletter for $30 for 12 issues

1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:20.120
 over three years, four times a year.

1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:22.320
 You can purchase his book at a books at Ray Peat's

1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:25.200
 by emailing Ray Peatsletter at gmail.com

1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:28.640
 from PMS to menopause, progesterone and orthomolecular medicine, gender of energy,

1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:32.320
 money and tissue, nutrition for women. And then if you want to purchase progesterone,

1:04:32.320 --> 1:04:37.040
 progestease, specifically from Ketogen, email katharine at ketogen at gmail.com.

1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:40.720
 Each bottle contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone. And then Ray, again,

1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:45.120
 people hate when I ask you to speculate, but what do you think we're in store for in 2022?

1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:53.840
 I think the resistors are going to put up more and more resistance, but Bill Gates has already

1:04:53.840 --> 1:05:02.000
 said that the people are working on a vaccine for the Marburg hemorrhagic fever virus, which is

1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:06.360
 similar to the Ebola virus and kills up to 90% of the

1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:12.240
 people that infects and he says that is likely to be the next epidemic and since

1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:19.200
 they are about ready to have a vaccine for it I think he might be right as soon

1:05:19.200 --> 1:05:27.040
 as a vaccine is able to come to market at a profit of half a trillion dollars, then we can have

1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:29.280
 the Marburg epidemic.

1:05:29.280 --> 1:05:38.000
 I think the resistance is gaining faster than the clever World Economic Forum schemers can

1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:41.640
 dream up catastrophes to happen to us.

1:05:41.640 --> 1:05:46.980
 But if this Warburg virus, if it's so deadly, just like Ebola, then it can't really be a pandemic

1:05:46.980 --> 1:05:48.920
 because it's going to kill most of the host

1:05:48.920 --> 1:05:50.340
 before it has a chance to spread, right?

1:05:50.340 --> 1:05:52.340
 How would you have a pandemic with that?

1:05:53.420 --> 1:05:56.640
 It's just scarier, and that's all that's needed

1:05:56.640 --> 1:06:01.020
 is to have a vaccine that is going to save everyone,

1:06:01.020 --> 1:06:06.640
 and all it has to do is kill a few dozen people that they didn't want anyway

1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:12.960
 and then they can sell a trillion dollars worth of vaccines. It'll probably be much more easy to

1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:17.520
 mandate because they'll be look this is truly deadly don't resist because COVID is nothing

1:06:17.520 --> 1:06:21.600
 compared to this. Yeah. But you're saying they could actually release something harmful not like

1:06:21.600 --> 1:06:25.600
 COVID being a mild type of thing, but this actually

1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:26.600
 being harmful?

1:06:26.600 --> 1:06:32.640
 Yeah, since so many people have caught on that don't want the vaccine and realize that

1:06:32.640 --> 1:06:40.440
 the vaccine mortality goes up the first month after being vaccinated, higher than not receiving

1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:50.880
 a vaccine, that awareness is getting out. And so they need something really to scare people, show people bleed

1:06:50.880 --> 1:06:56.200
 bleeding out of their eyes and ears and a real horror show.

1:06:56.220 --> 1:06:59.920
 Yeah, that would do it. And you so this second act, you think it

1:06:59.920 --> 1:07:02.440
 was strategic in making it even more gruesome?

1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:05.600
 Yeah, I think that's why they're interested in it.

1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:08.880
 Okay, well, we have that look forward to in 2022.

1:07:08.880 --> 1:07:11.120
 Very, very excited about that.

1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:12.400
 Can't wait.

1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:13.600
 Okay, Ray, I stay on the line.

1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:15.520
 Guys, thank you so much for hanging out.

1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:17.120
 Sincerely appreciate this year.

1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:20.480
 Other than being a total horror show, I've had fun doing this podcast.

1:07:20.480 --> 1:07:22.960
 And Georgie and Ray, you guys always make it really special.

1:07:22.960 --> 1:07:26.600
 And these have been my anchor this year of doing these.

1:07:26.600 --> 1:07:28.600
 I sincerely appreciate all the viewership.

1:07:28.600 --> 1:07:31.280

 And so I sincerely appreciate it.

1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:35.280
 So Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much.

1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:36.480
 And Ray, thank you so much.

1:07:36.480 --> 1:07:38.120
 Just it's been really incredible.

1:07:38.120 --> 1:07:40.320
 And I can't wait to continue to do it in 2022.

1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:42.640
 So Ray, stay on the line and guys, have a safe weekend.

1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:45.600
 We'll talk to you guys soon and have a good New Year's and peace out.

1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:45.960
 22. So right stay on the line and guys have a safe weekend. We'll talk to you guys soon and have a good New Year's and
