 You're about to experience ultrasounds, an uplifting soulful journey into the spheres of exotic electronic music.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:48.000
 Brought to you by DJ E-Love. WMNF 88.5 FM Tampa. Music for your mind, body, and soul. Kick back and get ready to seriously unwind.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.400
 This is the Ultrasounds Show and my name is E-Love. And we're going to be speaking with Dr. Ray Peat, who has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:13.200
 He specializes in physiology and is taught at several universities, including the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, the National College of Naturopathic Medicine, and he conducts private nutritional counseling.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 We're going to be speaking with him about the benefits of good oils with a bit of a focus on coconut oil.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.400
 Hello. Hello. Greetings and welcome to the Ultrasounds Show.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.000
 Wonderful to have you on. Thank you for coming on the show tonight.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.600
 And you've done some extensive research on nutrition and how oils affect the body and toxic effects of polyunsaturated oils.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.600
 So I wanted to start with defining what is a good oil. Basically, saturated fats are safe and even therapeutic.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:58.000
 And a man named Nanchi, who has been working with liver diseases, has demonstrated some of the toxicities of the unsaturated fats in a very comprehensive way.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.400
 And that coconut oil and all of the other saturated fats can be used therapeutically to treat liver disease, hepatitis and cirrhosis and such.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:20.400
 And the liver just happens to be his specialty. But people have demonstrated similar effects in all of the systems, brain protective effects, the skin, preventing aging of the skin and such.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:32.800
 Some very old experiments, they shaved rabbits and the rabbits that were given unsaturated vegetable oil in their diet when exposed to the sunlight got aged, wrinkled skin.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.200
 And the rabbits that were given coconut oil tolerated the sun exposure without aging effects.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.200
 Wow. So this really goes against what we've been taught here in the United States about saturated fats, that they were bad.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.200
 Yeah, the coconut industry doesn't have a good lobby in the United States.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:02.400
 What is that all about? Because years ago, apparently, we used to use coconut oil for many of our processes, food processes.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.600
 And what happened to that?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.800
 For a hundred years, it was a good, cheap oil that they made Oreo crackers and tortilla chips and potato chips.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.400
 And it was very popular because you could store it in a barrel as long as you wanted and it never got rancid.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:27.200
 But in the Second World War, the islands weren't accessible and they started experimenting with using other seed oils.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.800
 And animal food was one of the first places that they experimented with the unsaturated fats.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:43.400
 And they started seeing animals, rats and other lab animals dying with softening of the brain and degeneration of the gonads.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.800
 And they found that it was one of the effects of getting too much of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:57.800
 But after those experiments, the experimental animals were the first ones to show the damage.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.800
 But mink farmers were another early experience.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:11.800
 They were feeding the mink a lot of fish and the mink were getting a specific disease of their fat tissues that would ultimately be fatal.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.800
 It was called yellow fat disease and that was traced to the unsaturated fats in the fish.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:27.800
 So the early vitamin E studies showed that it would protect to a great extent against the overexposure to the unsaturated fats.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.800
 And that led to vitamin E being thought of as an antioxidant primarily.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:42.800
 Though vitamin E originally, research showed that it was an anti-estrogen for various reasons that came to be described only as an antioxidant

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.800
 because it protected against the polyunsaturated fat excess.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.800
 The reason there's a connection is that estrogen excess causes the oxidation of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.800
 And so an excess of either estrogen or polyunsaturated fat amounts to the same thing as a vitamin E deficiency,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.800
 leading to sterility and brain problems and skin aging and so on.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.800
 Is vitamin E a saturated oil?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:18.800
 Vitamin E is somewhat unsaturated but it happens to stop the chain reaction that proceeds if you have too much of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.800
 And if you don't have any of the polyunsaturated fats in your diet, you really don't need vitamin E.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.800
 The requirement for vitamin E is directly related to how much unsaturated fat you're eating.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.800
 So when they feed animals coconut oil, they find that they hardly need any vitamin E at all.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:48.800
 And the coconut oil works very much like vitamin E in stopping the chain reactions of oxidation in the polyunsaturated fats.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.800
 So let's go back to the fish oil.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:06:01.800
 Now there's a big, huge industry move for fish oil being promoted as brain food, great oil to take.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.800
 This is the next kind of phase going on right now.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.800
 So you're saying that that's actually not true?

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:21.800
 Yeah, I've got several articles on my website that one of them describes the history of the concept of unsaturated fats being essential as a nutrient.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:30.800
 But that was revived about 1950, research that had been knocked out because they were proven not to be essential nutrients.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.800
 You could cure a deficiency that had the disease that had been called an essential fatty acid deficiency.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.800
 You could cure it giving zinc and vitamin B6.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.800
 So it wasn't a fat deficiency at all.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.800
 It was a vitamin deficiency brought on by the intensified metabolism when you don't eat the fats.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.800
 You simply need better nutrition when your metabolism is running at a full 100% activity the way it should.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:05.800
 But following the discoveries that the polyunsaturated fats slow the metabolism so you don't need so many of the vitamins and proteins,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:16.800
 pig farmers found that that was very valuable because if they fed them a lot of polyunsaturated fat, strictly corn and soybean diet, for example,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:26.800
 the pigs didn't eat so much because their metabolism was suppressed and they could fatten the pigs very cheaply by suppressing their metabolism.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:34.800
 But since they sold the pigs young, it didn't matter that it also caused accelerated aging and cancer and heart disease.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:43.800
 So it was very popular to shift over to a high-fat diet for chickens and pigs and any animal that you wanted to fatten up.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.800
 After it became an established part of the American diet, it had the same effect on people.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:59.800
 It started making them obese even though they weren't eating as many calories as previously because it poisons the thyroid system.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:08.800
 And the thyroid makes you able to produce energy, use a lot of oxygen and eat a lot of food without getting fat.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:17.800
 But the polyunsaturated fats at three or four separate points block the function of the thyroid hormone, which is essential for health.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:27.800
 So this is really interesting because there's probably people out there who have gone to their doctor and the doctor says you have hypothyroid condition

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:33.800
 and they are concentrating on that, whereas that's almost an effect.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:45.800
 Yeah, if you have a slow metabolism and textbooks 60 years ago used to say that anyone could lose weight if they ate less than 1700 calories a day.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:54.800
 But women have been kept in closed wards where they could see everything they were eating and they could maintain their weight on 700 calories a day,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.800
 less than half of what used to be maintenance.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:04.800
 And that's simply because the American metabolic rate has drastically slowed over the last 50 years.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.800
 And sometimes taking just a tablespoon of coconut oil with supper.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:17.800
 The first time I experimented with it, I had been at about 186 pounds for 20 years.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:26.800
 It seemed to be my normal weight, but I started putting a tablespoon of coconut oil on my supper, putting it on meat or vegetable as a sauce.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.800
 And I noticed right after eating that coconut oil that I felt like I had been exercising.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.800
 I was pink and breathing hard for about two hours after supper.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:45.800
 And I did that every day and for about a week I had that hour of excess heat and hard breathing after eating.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.800
 But gradually that leveled out and I found that I was losing a pound a week.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:58.800
 And by adding another 100 or 200 calories a day in the form of coconut oil over a period of several weeks,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:05.800
 I stabilized at a new weight of about 176 pounds, about 10 or 12 pounds lighter than I had been.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:12.800
 There's got to be people out there going, he's eating oil and losing weight. Does this make sense?

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:21.800
 Years before I had read research with the rats in which they did the same study, but in a more methodical way.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:31.800
 They divided the rat into five different groups and each of those groups was divided into the high oil, medium or low oil intake.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:41.800
 And the five groups consisted of pure saturated fat, coconut oil, and the other extreme pure corn oil, I think it was unsaturated fat.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.800
 And then different proportions.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:53.800
 And at the end of their lifetime, the rat body fat was analyzed and the obesity didn't correspond to the number of calories they had eaten,

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.800
 but only to the ratio of saturated to unsaturated.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:05.800
 The low corn oil eaters who had a low calorie diet, but pure corn oil as the fat were the most obese.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:14.800
 All of the corn oil eaters were the most obese, but the low fat corn oil eaters were fatter than the high fat coconut oil eaters.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.800
 So it was strictly the ratio of fat, not the quantity of fat.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:29.800
 Going back to the feeding of animals or livestock for our consumption with these unsaturated fats, how is the effect on us?

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:37.800
 Are we taking in certain hormones or what happens in the transition of that when we're eating those products?

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:45.800
 People have analyzed lard, which a lot of scientists think of as a saturated fat, used to be when pigs ate well.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:58.800
 But for the last 50 years, pig fat has been chemically the same as corn oil or soy oil because that's what they eat and it gets stored in their tissues.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.800
 Wow.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:08.800
 And so when you eat pork from the industrial pigs, you're basically having a high vegetable oil intake, which is extremely fattening.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:17.800
 And beef and lamb, they evolved for eating vegetable material where pigs could eat basically anything.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:23.800
 But since the sheep and cows and deer and so on evolved as vegetarians,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:29.800
 they evolved a stomach which specifically destroys the polyunsaturated fat.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:36.800
 They have enzymes which happen to use vitamin E in the process of destroying the polyunsaturated fat.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:46.800
 And their rumen can take care of about 98 percent of the vegetable oil in their food, destroying it, turning it into saturated fat.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.800
 That's fantastic. It's good to know as far as making choices for regular diet.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:58.800
 That's why milk, even fairly fat milk or whole milk, is not associated with obesity.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.800
 Where I first noticed it was on a trip. I was in Russia where everyone was fat.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:11.800
 And when I crossed over to Finland and I hadn't been able to get any good milk in Russia, but just crossing the border into Finland,

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:18.800
 everyone had milk and cheese in their stores and I noticed that everyone was slender and healthy looking there.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.800
 And so I looked at the research and saw that milk drinkers have a very low incidence of obesity.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:30.800
 So what if they're drinking low fat milk on purpose? Would you recommend to avoid that?

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.800
 No, that's fine. But they just need to keep the fats in proportion.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:41.800
 So if you eat beef, you're always getting a large proportion of saturated fat, beef and lamb.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:49.800
 Even if you don't eat the fat part of the meat, the muscle tissue itself incorporates a pretty good percentage of saturated fat.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.800
 And would that be the same for duck or pheasant?

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.800
 No, those animals reflect exactly what they eat.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:04.800
 They don't have the detoxifying system and so they're pretty unsaturated.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.800
 It happens that they live at a very high body temperature though.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:18.800
 So poultry is not as bad as pork or rabbits or other animals that don't live at such a high body temperature

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.800
 because the higher the temperature of the organism, the more saturated the fat has to be.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:30.800
 And the extremely unsaturated fats are oxidized and break down so fast that in a chicken or a pheasant,

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.800
 they just don't make it into the tissue the way they do in a rabbit or a pig.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:41.800
 And what about the fish? If the fish oil is not good, is that simply because it's not good taken separately?

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:48.800
 Well, if you have ever had a piece of fat fish laying around at room temperature,

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:56.800
 it's even worse than leaving canola or soy oil or corn oil out at room temperature.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.800
 The fat gets rancid very quickly.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:07.800
 That's because it's evolved to live in cold water at just slightly above freezing temperature.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.800
 And at room temperature, it starts oxidizing quickly.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.800
 Anyone can do a simple experiment.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:19.800
 If you have a quart of unsaturated vegetable oil, you can put a cork in it

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:24.800
 and a small rubber tube from the top of the bottle into a glass of water.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.800
 At room temperature, the oil acts like it's respiring.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:35.800
 It's burning oxygen and breaking down, turning into basically plastic or varnish-like material.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.800
 And it sucks the water up the tube just like a small organism was breathing in the bottle.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.800
 Fish oil is even worse than the standard seed oils,

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:51.800
 unless, for example, there's an Amazon river fish where the water is very warm in the Amazon.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.800
 And that fish has fat that's very similar to olive oil and is much safer.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.800
 But we never get those in the United States.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.800
 What about fish from Florida, being that it's a little warmer?

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.800
 Yeah, undoubtedly, they're safer.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.800
 Any organism exactly reflects the temperature of the tissue,

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.800
 with the warmer tissue having a more saturated fat

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.800
 because the unsaturated fats break down so quickly at high temperature.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.800
 A biochemist put sweaters on pigs and found that their fat was more saturated

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.800
 just by keeping their skin warmer.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.800
 I can just visually see that.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.800
 You mentioned olive oil.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.800
 I was speaking with someone in Israel this week,

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.800
 and they were saying that they don't have coconut oil as a local commodity,

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:48.800
 and they happened to get their olive oil from somewhere up in the mountains,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.800
 and they said the olive oil is organic.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.800
 And she asked me, "Is that a good oil for us?"

00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:01.800
 It's one of the best oils that we can get in the United States next to coconut oil,

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.800
 but it still is about 10% of the toxic polyunsaturated fat,

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.800
 so you don't want to use more than just enough for flavoring.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.800
 It's very painful now and then,

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.800
 but it gives good taste without giving a toxic amount of the polyunsaturated.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.800
 And is there a particular quantity of coconut oil

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:27.800
 that someone would want to consume each day to reap the benefits?

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:33.800
 Well, I've known people who would eat ounces a day when they wanted.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:39.800
 Like one study was using a fraction of coconut oil for treating brain tumors,

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.800
 and it's sometimes used for treating epilepsy,

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:50.800
 but I've known people who were wanting to reduce their fat thighs or something very quickly,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.800
 and so they would eat five ounces a day.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.800
 And one very fat person thought he would lose weight quickly,

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.800
 and so he drank a cup of coconut oil for supper

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.800
 and said he thought he would explode.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.800
 It was so hot, he would never touch it again.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.800
 But usually with a tablespoon once or twice a day,

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.800
 that will intensify your metabolism and make you lose weight easier.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.800
 And you were mentioning that it reduces the estrogens.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.800
 Is that through the process of the thyroid?

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.800
 Yeah, the thyroid activates the liver,

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.800
 assuming that there's enough protein and B vitamins in your diet.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:41.800
 The liver should destroy 100% of the estrogen in the blood that passes through the liver.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.800
 But if your thyroid is low or if you're deficient in protein or B vitamins,

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.800
 your liver can allow all of the estrogen to pass through,

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.800
 and that systemically raises your exposure to estrogen,

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.800
 which blocks the secretion of the thyroid hormone,

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:05.800
 so it can start a vicious cycle that locks you into a high estrogen state with low thyroid function.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.800
 And in the estrogen-stimulated state,

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.800
 somehow we selectively favor the polyunsaturated fats.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.800
 One favors the other,

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:23.800
 but women normally have a much higher concentration of polyunsaturated fats circulating in their bloodstream

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.800
 because even if the fat tissues contain a mixture of fats,

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.800
 estrogen causes unsaturated fats to be released specifically.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:39.800
 And then the unsaturated fats activate the so-called estrogen receptor

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.800
 and intensify the effect of estrogen on the cells.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:49.800
 So does this have an effect on cellulite, on creating cellulite?

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:56.800
 Yeah, there's usually a lot of water in the tissue under the influence of estrogen

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:03.800
 because both estrogen and polyunsaturated fats cause cells to be more permeable.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:11.800
 Water leaks out of your capillaries very easily when you're overexposed to estrogen or polyunsaturated fat.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.800
 And so even though you might not have a lot of fat in your tissues,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.800
 the estrogen specifically around the thighs intensifies the leakiness

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.800
 and causes water to accumulate in those tissues as well as fat.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.800
 So you get both of it in there.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.800
 And why is it so difficult for women to get rid of it?

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:41.800
 Well, mostly because they keep their thyroid suppressed by the percentage of unsaturated fats in the diet.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:47.800
 The gland is unable to break down the stored thyroid hormone

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.800
 under the influence of either estrogen or polyunsaturated fat.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.800
 Both of them block the enzyme that secretes it.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:58.800
 And the protein that transports the thyroid hormone in the blood

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.800
 is competed against by both estrogen and polyunsaturated fat.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:08.800
 And the action of thyroid hormone in the tissues at different sites,

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.800
 the action is blocked by polyunsaturated fats.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:17.800
 Moving along in terms of the differences between different processing of the oil.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.800
 So if someone says, "Great, I'd love to do the coconut oil."

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.800
 How is the best way to take it?

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.800
 Is it cold pressed? Is it virgin? Is it expeller pressed?

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.800
 What's the differences between those styles?

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:39.800
 For at least 100 years and for probably thousands of years in India and other tropical climates,

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:48.800
 they have filtered it through clay or other material to remove the debris produced when you crush the coconut.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:55.800
 And that was done originally because particles of material caused the oil to go rancid

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:01.800
 by liberating enzymes which break down the fatty acids, free the fatty acids.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:07.800
 And the carotene and other nutrients in the oil when it's in its crude form

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.800
 are also removed in the filtering process.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.800
 And the research of all of the benefits of coconut oil,

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:21.800
 the research was done using the highly filtered tasteless pure product.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:28.800
 So it's the oil itself, not the nutrients in the natural product that have such a range of benefits.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.800
 So it's not the actual pulp of coconut?

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:38.800
 No, that's all removed so that the oil will last a long time and be stable.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:45.800
 And the protein itself has been tested as a food for various animals and it's okay as a food.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:51.800
 Most people can't digest it in its ordinary form because it has a high cellulose content.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:56.800
 And so it can cause gas if there's the pulp material in it.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.800
 And the product they call coconut milk is hard for some people to digest

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.800
 because of the vegetable material in it other than fat.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.800
 The nutrients are there in the fresh oil and it's delicious.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:14.800
 If you want to make ice cream or cookies out of it, it has a coconut flavor and has a great taste.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.800
 And it contains vitamin E and carotene and so on.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.800
 But it doesn't keep very well.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:29.800
 So for the weight loss and anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, liver-protecting effects and so on,

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.800
 just the plain tasteless filtered oil is fine.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.800
 And it happens to be extremely cheap.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:42.800
 Currently, a five-gallon bucket is about $50, 40 pounds I think they weigh.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.800
 And is that a cold process?

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.800
 And what's the difference between cold processed or virgin or expeller pressed?

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:55.800
 Well, the traditional way in India and the Philippines and Laos and Indochina

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:03.800
 was to crack the nuts open, let them dry somewhat so they could peel out the ripe coconut flesh.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.800
 And then they would chop it up and boil it.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.800
 And the oil rises to the surface where they would skim it off.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.800
 And so it was hot processed but only at the temperature of boiling water.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.800
 And when that's filtered, it lasts forever practically.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.800
 But if you want to get the full taste for making ice cream and such,

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:33.800
 you can use a slightly unmature nut that's a little softer and grind it up.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:40.800
 And the oil that rises is still going to have some of the tasty material in it.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:46.800
 And it has a very pleasant taste, but it isn't anything but a treat really.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.800
 Its nutritional value isn't so great.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:54.800
 How long does it take to see the benefits after consuming coconut oil for a little while?

00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:00.800
 Well, you can feel the effect usually in about 30 minutes after eating it.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.800
 You notice that your pulse rate goes up and your hands are warmer and such.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.800
 And that's the immediate effect which is beneficial.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:14.800
 It's starting the process, but the other processes take various periods depending on how fat you are.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.800
 It might take a year or two to get your oil exchanged.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:24.800
 All animals exchange their fat between their stores and their diet at about the same rate.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.800
 And a complete change takes four years.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:32.800
 So if you've had a very unsaturated diet for most of your life,

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.800
 your thyroid is going to keep being suppressed for two or three years anyway,

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.800
 even after you've changed over to the saturated fats.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.800
 And would it help the thyroid if the thyroid is fast as well?

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.800
 Does it help to balance it out?

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:54.800
 Yeah, usually when the thyroid is overactive, if your pulse rate is over 100 at rest

00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:01.800
 and if your temperature sticks around 99 degrees Fahrenheit and your hands are always red and sweaty,

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:09.800
 usually that is a self-correcting process that after about six weeks, your thyroid has unloaded the excess.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:15.800
 And in the last 50 years, people are frightened by that overproduction of heat.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.800
 They go to a doctor and the doctor kills their thyroid gland.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:25.800
 But it really is a self-corrective process usually when the thyroid is overactive.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:30.800
 So you're really saying in a nutshell that given the right fats,

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:40.800
 the body has the capability to absolutely regenerate and heal itself from the most serious conditions.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:47.800
 Yeah, there's a man in Israel, Gershom Zayachek, who has a website that's very interesting.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.800
 He calls it the streaming organism.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:58.800
 And he cites evidence in which all of the tissues and organs studied are in fact streaming,

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.800
 regenerating themselves constantly.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:10.800
 New cells are always being born in the brain, the eye, the liver, adrenal glands, thyroid, and so on.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:16.800
 And all you need is energy to keep that regeneration going at a good rate.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.800
 And the thyroid is the main thing that provides that energy.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:28.800
 So we really have a food that's so suitable for the thyroid in taking in unsaturated fats through coconut oil.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:37.800
 Yeah, the main value is that they will go to the same places that the toxic, dork, polyunsaturated fats go.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:43.800
 And so they interrupt the antithyroid effects momentarily.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.800
 When you eat a tablespoon full of coconut oil, it quickly gets into your bloodstream.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:59.800
 And while it's circulating, it's relieving the suppression of your metabolism by simply getting in front of the suppressive molecules.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.800
 So it's pushing its way in line, in front of the line.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.800
 Yeah, the shorter chain saturated fats in coconut oil,

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:15.800
 the carbon molecules that contain six, eight, and ten carbon molecules are very active metabolically.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.800
 And they literally will get ahead of the other long chain fat molecules.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:32.800
 And they can be taken up and metabolized by the mitochondria without using the transport system that involves carnitine that is used to treat heart disease and such.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:39.800
 But coconut oil bypasses that system and lets the fat get metabolized immediately.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:44.800
 So it's really like little kids crowding in line ahead of the big fat people.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:50.800
 And it sounds like it's acting more like a carbohydrate in terms of that than a fat.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:56.800
 Yeah, exactly. It's as easily metabolized as a sugar molecule.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.800
 So it's both helpful to the liver and less stress on the liver at the same time curative.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:08.800
 Yeah, and those short chain saturated fats happen to have sort of a hormone like effect.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:17.800
 They have an anti-histamine effect because they help to quiet the immune cells, keep them from producing too much histamine.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:23.800
 And they protect cells from overreacting to toxic excitants like histamine.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:35.800
 And they even immediately when they're released as a free fatty acid and their first metabolic passes through the mitochondria, they release ketones.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:48.800
 And these short fatty acids and ketones act like the GABA transmitters in the brain and other tissues to quiet and calm over excited cells.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:54.800
 That's pretty profound there because it seems as it would be some kind of anti-stress effect.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:04.800
 Yeah, and the GABA system, people usually think of it as a nerve transmitter, but it's really active in all types of cells.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:10.800
 And it helps, for example, to slow excess cell division in tumors.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:20.800
 And that's probably one of the reasons that the saturated fats are protective against tumors, that it's applying the brakes the way the GABA molecule would.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:30.800
 In your personal nutritional counseling, have you seen people that have started on the coconut oil that have had tumors or other serious diseases?

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.800
 Have you seen them shift?

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:38.800
 Well, yeah, but if a tumor goes away by itself, it wasn't a cancer.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:44.800
 So lumps go away, but according to the doctrine, a cancer doesn't regress.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:53.800
 And so every time a lump regresses, you know, it wasn't cancer, according to the orthodox.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.800
 Which we, which I personally, I respect.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.800
 I do coconut oil every day, several times a day.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.800
 I drink it.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.800
 I eat it.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.800
 I put it in my smoothies.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.800
 And I also use it for skin care.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:18.800
 Yeah, it's, the rabbit experiment was using internal coconut oil and trying to protect it against skin aging and sunburn.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:25.800
 But if you happen to be sunburned, you can apply coconut oil quickly and get a protective antihistamine effect.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:39.800
 Because what happens when the sun hits your skin is the excitation quickly spreads to the polyunsaturated fats in your skin cells and creates a progressing after effect.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:51.800
 And the saturated fats can interrupt that spreading of destructive oxidation through the polyunsaturated fats, even right in your skin when you put it on the surface.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:32:02.800
 Wasn't there studies in Thailand and in Asia for the fact that their skin was able to handle sun better by their intake of coconut oil?

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:10.800
 Yeah, I had read the animal experiments for years and years, but I was consulting with some people in San Diego.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:16.800
 There was a doddering old man and his attractive young Filipino wife.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:27.800
 She said that they had been married for 30 or 40 years and that she said he had never learned to like Philippine food and she had never learned to like American food.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.800
 And so three meals a day, she made two separate meals.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:37.800
 She cooked her meals all in coconut oil and his all standard American food.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.800
 And it turned out that she was almost as old as he was.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.800
 Wow.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.800
 She looked 30, 40 years younger than him.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:49.800
 So there you go. There's also some fringe benefits externally.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.800
 Wonderful. Thank you so much for coming on the show.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:59.800
 We've had just a wonderful, wonderful talk with you and thank you for sharing all this valuable information.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:09.800
 And for people that would like to read more about your teachings and your nutritional counseling, would you like to let them know where to find you?

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:15.800
 Yeah, the website is Raypeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.800
 And there are about 50 or 60 of my articles on there.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:25.800
 And are you available for nutritional counseling on the phone, say if someone from Tampa wants to call you and ask questions?

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.800
 Yeah, they can email me through the website.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.800
 Excellent. Thank you so much for joining us.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.800
 We've been speaking with Dr. Raypeat.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.800
 Thank you and many, many blessings and we welcome you on the show anytime.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.800
 Okay, thank you.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.800
 Thank you, sweetheart. Peace and love.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.800
 Bye.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.360
 Bye.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:46.360
 Thank you so much.
