 This free program is paid for by the listeners of Redwood Community Radio.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.160
 If you're not already a member, please think of joining us.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.160
 Thank you.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:23.320
 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.920
 My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray. For those of you who perhaps have never

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.640
 listened to our shows, they run

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.040
 every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.600
 and we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.680
 graduating there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.880
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.640
 of conditions

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.720
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herb extracts which are

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.200
 either grown in our CCUF certified herb farm or which we source from other

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.880
 USA certified organic suppliers. So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.680
 on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.720
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.080
 at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.400
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic of weight gain.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.080
 The number here if you live in the area is 9233911

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.960
 or if you live outside the area the toll-free number

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.040
 is 1-800-KMUD-RAD. We can also be reached toll-free

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.040
 on 1-888-WBM-HERB for further questions during normal

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.560
 business hours Monday through Friday. Once again

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.360
 we're very welcome to have Dr. Raymond Peat to share his expertise on the

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.360
 subject tonight.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.160
 Again one of those subjects related to something that he

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.880
 has a lot of experience with through his research into

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.400
 thyroid and progesterone

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.440
 other related compounds

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.800
 that are essential if you like for

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.000
 healthy metabolism and for anti-stress anti-aging effects.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.040
 So thanks so much for joining us

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.440
 again this month Dr. Peat.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.920
 So I think as usual we want to give the benefit to those listeners perhaps who

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.160
 haven't heard of you or

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.000
 haven't tuned into this show before the benefit of your

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.320
 past experience so if you wouldn't mind just detailing your academic

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.920
 professional career to those people.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.880
 After I had taught linguistics and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.840
 English and such for a while I decided to go to graduate school in biology

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.120
 at University of Oregon and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.520
 graduated there with my PhD in 1972

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.880
 with specializing in physiology and biochemistry especially

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.600
 reproductive physiology and right after I

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.720
 left university I worked for a while with the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.520
 diet company counseling people in weight loss.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.600
 So that was 41 years ago.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.880
 Yeah. Okay well hopefully we're going to cover quite a lot of material here tonight

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.040
 I know the subject surrounding tonight's topic of

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.200
 weight gain or how to avoid it and what causes it etc etc will be pretty

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.320
 pertinent to a lot of people even if they're not overtly overweight.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.280
 So I think one of the main things just to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.320
 let people know about apart from anything else is that

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.720
 you do actually have a pretty active Facebook fan page Dr. Peat whether you

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.080
 know it or not I don't know but

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.520
 it's an active repeat

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.240
 Facebook fan page for those of you who are familiar with Facebook and

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.720
 use it that's something perhaps you might want to look at this pretty

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.760
 lively debate and forum surrounding

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.120
 most of those topics that we've covered with Dr. Peat over the last few years.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.600
 So I think one of those things that has come out

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.360
 of the forum and I know it's something that we've noticed ourself

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.320
 but that's not to say that it's unavoidable because it certainly is and

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.320
 that's going to be the discussion of tonight's show.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.800
 I think one of those things that people

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.840
 are asking each other on the Facebook page

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.240
 is how people can adopt your diet

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.640
 and not expect any weight gain.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.920
 I know the thing that most people have talked about

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.640
 is some extra weight around the abdomen

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.600
 in relation to your specifications for diet.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.440
 So Sarah what would you say?

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.520
 I just think that's quite a broad statement.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.880
 You can't say that people adopt Dr. Peat's diet because

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.280
 you know if we say milk is good for you

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.640
 and you go and you start drinking a half a gallon of whole milk a day

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.080
 you're going to put on weight unless you basically cut out all other calories.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.760
 This is where I think people get confused like how much milk should I drink

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.160
 and if I don't want to gain weight should I drink whole milk or low-fat or you know.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.960
 The same with cheese too.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.160
 I advise eating cheese because of its high

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.600
 calcium and protein content but you have to consider the calories because

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.080
 some cheese has practically no fat

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.000
 others are basically like soft butter

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.720
 for their fat content.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.040
 Dr. Peat I guess what I wanted to start off with first then

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.680
 was asking you this. One of the main

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.640
 components to weight management then is a functional energy reserve

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.760
 coupled with a healthy metabolism and this is your expertise so

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.720
 would you outline perhaps what constitutes a healthy metabolism in

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.440
 terms of

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.080
 what we know is glucose oxidation versus the opposite the fatty acid

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.880
 metabolism

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.200
 that occurs with stress so our listeners can tell the difference.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.000
 Dr. Peat just to say that you've told us before that if somebody has an unhealthy

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.920
 metabolism they'll have a hard time burning

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.240
 1200-1000 calories a day.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.960
 About 30 or 40 years ago in which

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.880
 doctors used to follow the textbook standard that

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.160
 everyone can lose weight

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.600
 if they eat less than 1700 calories a day

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.880
 because that was studied in the 20s or 30s

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.200
 on healthy people and so they

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.080
 put a group of women who claimed that they were gaining weight on 1000

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.720
 calories

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.080
 put them in a closed ward and actually counted how much

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.960
 food they were eating and some of them could maintain their weight on

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.920
 700 calories a day especially women who had

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.440
 dieted a lot because several adaptations

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.680
 happen to chronic poorly balanced

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.720
 dieting. The thyroid slows down

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.160
 and especially the muscle tissues

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.400
 atrophy from the stress of dieting

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.680
 and if you think of the stress metabolism

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.200
 as being very similar to

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.480
 the diabetic metabolism

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.000
 basically you shift over to burning

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.120
 fat rather than sugar.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.320
 At rest your brain

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.400
 and red blood cells need sugar

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.960
 and they'll keep burning it

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.960
 regardless of where they have to get it. If you don't eat enough

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.480
 of the necessary nutrients

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.080
 your body will convert your muscles to sugar

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.280
 to keep feeding your brain what it needs and

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.360
 if you are eating enough sugar

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.960
 or things which can be turned into sugar

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.120
 then your body doesn't have to break down its own tissues

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.320
 to make the necessary glucose for your

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.440
 blood cells and brain and in that condition

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.440
 your muscles at rest don't require

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.760
 practically any glucose. They can do fine

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.600
 on a pure fat diet but that's the resting muscle.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.320
 If your muscles are under stress

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.760
 after a very intense exercise the muscles

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.800
 will begin burning almost pure sugar.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.200
 So it's the

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.120
 massive muscle at rest

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.680
 which will burn fat calories

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.080
 and leave the protein

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.160
 for your functioning tissues

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.520
 and sugar to sustain your essential

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.120
 brain and immune system. So this is why you're an advocate

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.720
 of muscle building because then it helps convert your

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.720
 fat into, well it helps your body to burn the fat for

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.920
 fuel rather than just using the sugar. Yeah and

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.640
 when the muscle is stressed it begins

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.360
 actually producing estrogen.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.040
 When you're building muscle in a safe way

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.000
 the muscle begins producing testosterone

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.360
 actually right in the muscle which helps the rest of the body.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.840
 The heart is one of the main targets

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.400
 of testosterone.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.240
 So well-developed skeletal muscles

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.440
 are actually sustaining the heart muscle

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.880
 as well as the brain and the lungs which need the stabilizing

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.280
 anti-inflammatory steroids. So is this why

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.000
 they find that when there's muscly people that they have

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.120
 longer lifespans? One of the reasons you think?

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.200
 Well yeah everything that

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.800
 tends to kill you shrinks your muscles.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.360
 Fragility is the basic thing that

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.440
 associates with aging. Bones and muscles

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.760
 go away at about the same rate with aging.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.160
 Okay so getting back to

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.560
 what you've started to outline under

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.000
 what would be regular metabolism for the body to burn

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.480
 glucose preferentially rather than

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.920
 liberating free fatty acids to produce energy.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.440
 The diet starvation type model would then force your body

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.120
 into utilizing stored fats for energy. Is that correct?

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.960
 Except when it does that it also

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.640
 needs to make some sugar for your brain

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.680
 and so it breaks down the tissues. The first to go

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.040
 is your thymus which in just a few hours

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.200
 they used to think that adults

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.240
 didn't have a significant amount of thymus tissue because

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.480
 they looked at people who had died after being sick

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:12.200
 and even if you die slowly after a traumatic accident

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.440
 your thymus is gone. It just takes a few hours of intense

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.600
 stress for the thymus to be dissolved and so a long fast

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.880
 will just completely devastate your thymus

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.120
 tissues. It turns into sugar very quickly.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.960
 That's important for your immune system right? Yeah and

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:37.160
 the skin is relatively dispensable too in the long run

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.640
 so your skin atrophies very quickly with a fast

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.520
 or even a low calorie diet and

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.640
 then the muscles go, you can live

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.840
 months on your muscles providing sugar for your brain

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.640
 if necessary if you have big muscles.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.840
 Lots of the women that I used to see

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.960
 who were there for a weight loss diet

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.120
 you couldn't find a bicep muscle

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.200
 or a calf muscle. They couldn't

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.360
 they would try to tighten their muscle and they couldn't feel or find

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.400
 anything either in their upper arm or

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.960
 lower leg. The muscle was

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.960
 maybe the size of a person's index finger.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.040
 So when they would first start

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.600
 eating a good diet, the first thing that would happen

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.200
 would be pounds of water loss.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.440
 Their tissue would suddenly come out of the stress

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.320
 condition and get rid of some of the stored water.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.240
 Then the muscle would start growing. The first week they might lose

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.840
 10 or 15 pounds of water.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.120
 For about a month they would start putting on weight

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.880
 as their muscles began growing.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.240
 Muscles are denser than fat, right?

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.400
 A slender person with a well-defined muscular structure

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.640
 would weigh more than a larger person that seemed large through

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.800
 fat. Yeah, we would have people

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.280
 measure their waist and thighs and hips

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.480
 and each week they would get smaller as they gained weight.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.800
 Okay, as they started leaning and toning up

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.640
 they shrunk in volume or they increased in mass.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.960
 So what about

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.400
 athletes and you know like long-distance runners, people that are very

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.720
 thin and lean? How healthy would you say their metabolism is?

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.040
 There was a study

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.160
 of using radioactive testosterone and

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.240
 they not only saw that

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.240
 the runners' muscles were atrophied

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.600
 but comparing them to weightlifters who had developed

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:06.160
 huge skeletal muscles, with these isotopes they could make a picture of

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:06.560
 their

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.880
 heart, lungs, and brain and so on.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.920
 All of their tissues had atrophied

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.760
 so that the lean long-distance runners also had

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.240
 lean, flabby hearts, very thin hearts.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.440
 And here that's supposed to be

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.760
 a heart-healthy form of exercise. It's a stereotypical picture of health,

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.040
 kind of Kenyan long-distance marathon runner.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.920
 You know a lot of things happen. Fertility is often

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.920
 reduced because the testosterone goes down and the

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.720
 very immediate thing that you can see in

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.960
 even fairly low-intensity exercise

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.560
 is that the lungs lose

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:54.800
 some of their ability to diffuse oxygen in and carbon dioxide out.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.520
 The actual substance of the lung

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.400
 air sac thickens with just a

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.920
 fairly moderate amount of continued exercise.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.520
 Is that an inflammatory process that's causing that?

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.200
 Yeah, it's a kind of edema, mild inflammation.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.360
 And sports anemia

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.000
 is a recognized thing. It's a combination of

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.280
 all of those little stresses and

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.520
 shift away from the anabolic

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.840
 testosterone to the... females are always

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.040
 relatively anemic because of the influence of

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.360
 the balance of estrogen relative to the

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.280
 androgens. And sports anemia

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:47.560
 is somewhat like the feminizing effect of estrogen on the blood system.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.520
 So the long-distance runner has a

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.160
 deformed heart and deformed lungs basically compared to the body builder.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.440
 Yeah. Okay, well let's hold it there for a second. You're listening to Ask Europe, Doctor on

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.640
 KMUD Galbraithville 91.1 FM and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.440
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.680
 unrelated to this month's subject of weight loss. Our guest speaker here is Dr. Raymond Peat

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.600
 and from 7.30 until 8 we'll be open for questions.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.920
 But Dr. Peat, moving on a little bit then in

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.080
 a tangent direction, are some people

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.520
 more predisposed to this kind of inefficient

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.680
 glucose oxidation from other courses like

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.400
 I know you've mentioned PUFA a lot or cortisol

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.240
 dominant type pictures?

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.960
 Yeah, lots of things can interfere with

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.440
 your higher rate of metabolism. Things that

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.800
 suppress your thyroid are the basic

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.920
 most common thing but anything that can

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.400
 increase your cortisol

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.040
 or even your glucagon can

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.160
 interfere with your metabolism, slow down your metabolic rate.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.680
 Serotonin,

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.200
 estrogen for example, both lower

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.160
 your body temperature and many

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.640
 stresses can increase those and

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.760
 those tend to increase the glucagon, shift you away from

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.200
 being able to oxidize

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.720
 the glucose and instead depend on

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:36.280
 fatty acid oxidation. So sluggish digestion could increase

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:41.240
 estrogen and serotonin and radiation could increase

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.520
 estrogen and serotonin?

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.400
 Yeah, the bowel is one of the ways

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.760
 to get rid of unneeded estrogen

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.480
 by way of the liver excreting it and if your bowel is sluggish

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.240
 you reabsorb it and if your bowel is

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.040
 irritated and sluggish it secretes

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.040
 much more serotonin than needed

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.400
 which affects your whole hormonal system bringing up the

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.840
 stress hormones and contributing to lowered

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.960
 temperature. So eating carrots

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.000
 with vinegar or lemon juice or just carrots

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.680
 and taking liver herbs like cascara and dandelion root

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.040
 milk thistle can help with sluggish bowels?

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.080
 Yeah, and just eating

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.720
 what you consider to be the most delicious food

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.680
 can greatly help the intestine

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.720
 secrete more juices so

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.040
 things digest faster and move along more smoothly.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:46.720
 So enjoy your food? Hopefully we can enjoy our food and

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.800
 and hopefully it's not enjoying pufas which is fried

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.920
 whatever. As long as it's not fried in a coconut

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.160
 oil then it's bad for you.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:02.080
 Okay, so let's get back to where we were at the beginning

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.160
 in terms of people mentioning that they can't help but

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.120
 gain a bit of extra mid-weight and I think what we're

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.600
 coming around to is that exercise and muscle building

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.320
 however small or however gentle, however gradual is one of the most important

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:18.920
 things

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:24.720
 when adopting a typical diet that would certainly replace all the nutrition

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.320
 that a person needs. I know your diet does that.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.560
 So in terms of gentle muscle building

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.720
 how do you advocate that to happen say in a

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.320
 sedentary 60-year-old lady

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.280
 perhaps? Just doing an occasional

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.560
 knee bend, squatting and standing up again

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.600
 and maybe getting some five

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.720
 pound dumbbells and

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.920
 lifting those in different motions. Just a few lifts

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.960
 two or three times a day

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.000
 and when you're doing that maybe squat

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.880
 once or twice. Right, because it really is about being actively involved

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.960
 in generating muscle

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:16.200
 however gently or however lightly the weight or the exercise would

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.560
 involve. Okay, because you're saying essentially that muscle

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.320
 in its own right effectively burns

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.240
 glucose and the very presence of muscle with the increase

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.560
 in testosterone will actually improve the metabolic rate.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.040
 Now another

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.080
 direction then, you've mentioned

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.080
 earlier on that

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.680
 you said, and this is for the guys I think

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.560
 preferentially because they probably have more of a chance to see this, but

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.200
 you mentioned foaming urine as being an indicator of

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.920
 an excess excretion of steroid hormone

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.720
 precursors and being a sign of stress.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.080
 Well, yeah, in the morning

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.520
 you have generally been exposed to

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.320
 several hours of darkness and

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.440
 darkness is very stressful.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.280
 Just staying indoors too much

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.360
 gives you chronic stress from the absence of light

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.800
 but everyone in the morning is at their peak

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.200
 of being exposed to

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.560
 stress hormones from the darkness and

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.800
 during stress like starvation

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.840
 the hormones first

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.600
 try to mobilize energy

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.120
 production and that during the night involves

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:54.000
 increased free fatty acids. It's sort of like

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.040
 doing a little marathon during the night

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.920
 as far as the shift to fatty acids goes

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.360
 and your liver if it's well

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.960
 nourished and supplied with thyroid hormones will

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.240
 process steroids such as

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.480
 estrogen and cortisol which

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.960
 reach it, the liver will attach

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.440
 either sulfate or

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.760
 sugar, glucuronic acid to make it

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.560
 water-soluble so that then it can leave in the

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.680
 bloodstream to the kidneys and be excreted.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.200
 And in that attached to

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.840
 either the sulfate or the sugar

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.200
 it's like a soap.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.600
 It's oily at one end and water-soluble at the other

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.280
 and so it makes foam. And during the night the

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.720
 fatty acids can be processed in the same way

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:57.760
 and the liver especially recognizes

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.840
 the unsaturated fatty acids but

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.360
 whatever arrives during the night

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.360
 is likely to contribute to that morning foam.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.720
 Okay, so I know you mentioned the liver's ability in

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.040
 storing glucose for the night time

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.080
 diet, fast if you like,

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.000
 for the eight hours that we don't eat. So given that a person's consuming

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.960
 adequate sugars during the daytime to stock their liver

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.160
 for the night time fast

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.880
 or given that the person would, as we recommend, and I know that you've

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.040
 been an advocate and suggestion of this, that they're

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.800
 eating a small amount of ice cream at night time before bed or they're taking a

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.200
 glass of orange juice to bed with them to sip on whenever they wake up to

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.800
 get a little bit of sugar so that their adrenaline is kept down and their

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.600
 night time

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.280
 stress response doesn't occur. Do you think that is that still possible for

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.280
 somebody to have

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.920
 foaming more morning urine in the presence of

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.000
 sugars during the night time?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.360
 The stress always occurs but if you're sleeping

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.520
 soundly and deeply there's less

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:14.440
 intense damage from the stress. So if you stayed awake in the dark

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.960
 you would probably have

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.200
 super foamy urine in the morning.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.840
 And this is something else, perhaps during the daytime if

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.920
 some of the guys notice what's happening with them during the day

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.520
 this again would be another indicator of

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.400
 insufficient sugars to block adrenaline and other stress hormones and that their

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.560
 system is reasonably stressed. Yeah I think so.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.200
 And what about for females? Same thing.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.680
 This is not as obvious. I'm only saying it because of

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.040
 how obvious it is.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.200
 So going on to

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.040
 the shift in

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.480
 fat content or fat makeup that you advocate from

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.320
 are the recommendations that our listeners have heard over the last few years

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:11.400
 in terms of increased saturated fats, switching to butter, coconut,

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.200
 palm oil, excluding all the liquid oils

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.560
 as sources of PUFA.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:23.080
 I know you've mentioned in the past that the

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.240
 need to avoid PUFA is pretty paramount

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.160
 if you really want to make a change in your physiology but

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.640
 I think you've also said that it's very difficult to

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.000
 avoid it totally because you're naturally going to produce some.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.680
 Well the natural foods

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.320
 milk, beef, lamb, coconut,

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.520
 oil and so on, these all have 2 or 3 percent

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.240
 unsaturated polyunsaturated fats.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.800
 If you eat just a tiny bit more

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.080
 then you're going to burn

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.720
 right away. Some of it gets stored

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.080
 in your fat tissue and what is stored is

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:11.800
 preferentially polyunsaturated fats. Your body recognizes

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.800
 that the good stuff to burn right away is the saturated fat

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.960
 right after the sugars.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.360
 So it selectively doesn't burn

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.680
 the polyunsaturated fat quickly

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.920
 and so it's the most likely to be stored but then your fat

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.280
 is the same way. Fat cells prefer to burn

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.600
 saturated fat and so whatever you've

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.680
 stored in your fat by eating more than you needed

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.480
 over time your fat cells

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:50.040
 use up the percentage of the stored saturated fat

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.480
 and increase the percentage of the stored polyunsaturated fat so that

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.520
 as you get older and fatter or even if you don't get fatter

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.600
 as you get older your fat tissue becomes more polyunsaturated

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.480
 so that each time you get hungry or

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.680
 stressed and draw on your fat stores

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.880
 for energy it is more

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:17.360
 anti-thyroid and more pro-estrogenic

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:21.520
 because of its increasing polyunsaturation

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.960
 with time. So with a common recommendation of

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.440
 this is a common recommendation I make is include three tablespoons of coconut

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.720
 oil in your diet a day

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:36.720
 but of course if we're talking about someone who only burns 700 calories a day

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.960
 would you still make that same recommendation to do three tablespoons

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.440
 of coconut oil? No, more like a small teaspoon three times a day.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:49.560
 Right, so I think basically what our listeners and we have to keep in mind is that

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:54.040
 everybody's metabolism is at a different rate and if someone's eating a 1200

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.400
 calorie a day diet and it's like perfect and they say I can hardly

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.720
 anything well that's probably because they're only burning 700 and

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.040
 they just keep gaining weight on 1200.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.920
 Alright so

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.680
 is there any way then perhaps for those people who probably

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.560
 we're talking about right now to be able to assess their metabolic rate given that

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.400
 that is what is driving

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.480
 how well they do or don't lose weight?

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.840
 One way is just to look everything up in a

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:30.240
 food analysis chart and measure the amount of

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.360
 calories you're eating every day but another way is to

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.400
 calculate or take note of

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.680
 the fluid that you drink, milk, juice,

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:45.480
 coffee, total volume of

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.960
 fluid intake in a day and measure the

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.480
 total volume of urine output in the same

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:57.320
 period of time and the difference is what's evaporated

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.560
 and in an average

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:04.560
 level of activity and average relative humidity

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.000
 a person will generally evaporate a liter

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.640
 per thousand calories burned. So if you have

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.840
 only a missing liter of fluid in the day you know you're only burning a thousand

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.440
 calories.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.320
 So if someone gets a half a gallon of fluid a day

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.720
 and they only pee out say

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.720
 a couple cups

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.360
 then you know that they're very

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.040
 their system is very low thyroid.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.920
 Well yeah. I mean sorry very high thyroid.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.040
 A pint out of two liters that's a 1500 calorie

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.200
 burning so that's not very much

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:54.280
 either. Right but if somebody drinks a half a gallon and they practically pee

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.720
 you know. A quart and a half that's

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.880
 very bad. Bad ratio.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.400
 And a half a gallon that would be about two liters? Yeah.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.400
 I just thought we might want to remind listeners that it is 730

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.680
 and the phone lines are open if people want to call in and have any questions

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.720
 about the subject tonight.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.680
 Or any other subject that they're interested in

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.200
 relating to the. Thank you Jordan.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.920
 Okay so excuse me I know you also

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:29.240
 are very keen that females and males

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.680
 do everything they can to limit their exposure

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.440
 to estrogen for all its negative effects.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:40.560
 Estrogen dominant females this is something else that you

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.920
 brought out that it's not you don't always take it for granted that

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.320
 estrogen dominated dominant females would be

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:52.720
 overweight with those what we typically imagine is estrogen

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.240
 tendencies but actually you could get a slender

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.520
 slender woman based on the same

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.920
 the same conditions with estrogen. In the animal studies

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.960
 they've seen that estrogen

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.840
 excites some of the

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.920
 metabolic processes while slowing

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:17.000
 others down and it can make the animals

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.080
 hyperactive

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.720
 but very slender and

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.800
 in people it there are

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.880
 cases where it can do that same thing it can make

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.280
 a woman tense very hyper

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:38.920
 active and over sensitive and very skinny

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.520
 but it can do the other it can turn on

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.680
 the stress metabolism while it

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.960
 slows the metabolism lowering the body temperature for example

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.240
 and that can lead to

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.560
 excess fat storage. And that's the same in men as well

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.280
 excess estrogen can make some men very thin and excess estrogen can make some men

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.640
 overweight. Is there any surefire way of

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.560
 differentiating one condition in the two separate

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:15.920
 physical pictures? No

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.480
 nothing that I'm...

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.080
 Do you know what the

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.920
 the biological preference is for driving

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:31.960
 driving in one or the other direction?

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.000
 No. Okay alright

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.640
 I had to ask but I'm sure there's something more

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.040
 you'll bring out in a bit. We've got two callers on the line Dr. Peat so let's

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.120
 take the first of the two callers. You're on the air?

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:50.640
 This is David, hello. Hi David. Where are you calling from tonight David?

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.200
 Yeah I think that's the other thing I want to bring everyone's

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.600
 attention. Let's find out where everyone's from. I am from Missouri

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.920
 Missouri. And I've

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.320
 actually talked to Sarah a few times and emailed

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.920
 and emailed Dr. Peat. I really appreciate this show by the way

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:15.440
 I've listened to these podcasts. I've downloaded every podcast that you've done

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.440
 You're very welcome. And that's what I listen to when I drive

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.080
 and I just sometimes I've listened to several of these

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.560
 over several times. And there's a lot in there. It takes a while to unpack it.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.840
 Oh yeah I know it's just amazing how it seems like each week that goes by I just understand this

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.720
 more and more at a deeper level and I just

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.960
 I love it. Well iPods are useful then.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.680
 Absolutely. And we're very grateful for Dr. Peat. I've got two

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.640
 different sets of questions that still pertain to everything you've talked about tonight

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.200
 One is I have a fairly weak

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.280
 left knee and so I've been kind of experimenting with using

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:56.200
 a rebounder. I've got two different types. A more soft one and then one that's

00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:00.800
 a little bit firmer. And I kind of go back and forth between the two. I do very light

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.040
 you know just bouncing and then

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.280
 also running in place or jogging. And I usually try to do that

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.280
 you know like three to five minutes and I do that several times to the day if I'm at

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.280
 home working

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.520
 I'm just curious what you think of that.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.800
 Dr. Peat?

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.240
 I don't know if there's much benefit to the

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.800
 bouncing. It does strengthen your bones I guess

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.200
 the compression and concussion

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:34.800
 but something that builds more massive muscles

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:39.360
 stress even though it isn't

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.880
 fatiguing just

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:47.320
 resistance training in little bursts I think

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:52.280
 would help to raise your androgens and strengthen the connective tissues

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.680
 That was one of the questions I was going to ask you Dr. Peat. So just using like different weights

00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.040
 and not doing too much stress but

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:04.880
 trying to do a certain amount of repetitions where you're just strengthening

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.480
 the muscles

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.800
 that is a good thing to do. Yeah make the muscle

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.880
 know that it's been active

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.920
 warm it up a little but not enough to make you

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:20.560
 get out of breath or anything. And then what do you feel about just doing basic yoga

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.680
 you know like doing different postures and holding those postures where you're

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.280
 actually holding the muscles in a

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.480
 semi-stressed state but then relaxing it

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.120
 Yeah that kind of stress is good for the muscles

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.920
 Okay and then the other thing I wanted to ask you about you know I've

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.280
 I've been using the 250 watt

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:45.640
 bulbs that you had recommended and I've got three of those and I use those in

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.120
 different places around the house because I'm a photographer I have light

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.520
 stands so it makes it kind of easy to move them around but

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.160
 I'm curious you know because you've talked about the

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:01.160
 stress of darkness before you you know after the sun goes down and as you go into

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.520
 the evening before you go to bed

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.520
 do you think it's useful to use those

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:10.600
 right before going to bed like say for 15 minutes to a half hour and then maybe

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.600
 when you arrive in the morning maybe doing it for a half hour like while you're

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.960
 drinking your coffee or

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.080
 I think so and I'm basing that on some

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:24.160
 studies that were done on plant tissues about

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.680
 30 or 40 years ago they found that

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.440
 any kind of tissue put in sunlight or ultraviolet light

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.800
 got some excited free

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.480
 radicals or excited electrons and

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.920
 shining red light on those

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.360
 would just immediately quench

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.720
 those that had been excited but

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:54.120
 if you keep living tissue in the dark

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.160
 it starts building up

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.400
 more of those excited electrons over a period of

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:05.160
 30 minutes or so you can

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.320
 see an increase in them. Wow that's great

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.640
 okay and then just one last question is

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.000
 dreaming a sign that you're having a certain degree of stress through the night

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 rather than being in a deep sleep where you're not remembering your dreams when

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 you wake up in the morning

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.960
 and when you wake up in the middle of the night? Yeah the metabolism

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.560
 has these cycles the

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.920
 24-hour cycle is the basic thing but it is

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.160
 subdivided into roughly 90-minute cycles

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.840
 of ups and downs where the blood sugar and the adrenaline

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.240
 everything is mobilized

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.520
 a little bit and

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.560
 if your liver is running short on

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.520
 fuel the cycles become

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.760
 more intense and the dream cycles

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.520
 go with drops in the blood sugar

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.240
 and surges of the nerve chemicals

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.520
 such as adrenaline.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.680
 So if you were having a really great dream

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.800
 that was exhilarating and you felt really good about when you woke up

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.920
 would that still be the case because it's actually

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.000
 causing you to awaken?

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.040
 Yeah except that's probably that

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.960
 your whole system recognizes that

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.760
 it has been rested and it's time to get up and eat something

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.920
 and that's often why you have dreams

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:38.760
 in the early hours in the morning because that's when you run out of sugar at that point.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.800
 Yeah that makes sense.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.680
 What were you going to say Dr. Peat? If your body is well rested from

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.040
 six or eight hours of sleep then the dreams are likely

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:53.080
 to have a very pleasant quality

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:57.640
 getting ready to go out and do something. It's preparing you to wake up

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:01.160
 as opposed to the nightmares.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.800
 Yeah as opposed to the 1am nightmares.

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.640
 So that means that your body is really stressed out and it's

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.720
 not getting what it needs. Thank you so much for your call.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.080
 Thank you. Okay we've got two more callers so let's take the next caller.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:20.400
 Hi and where are you from? Yeah I'm calling from Piercy.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.480
 Okay just down the road.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.600
 I turned the radio on just in the midst of

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:32.080
 the subject about urinating

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.680
 and taking in fluid.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:41.440
 My question is if you take in a half gallon of fluid a day

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.480
 and you pee out most of that

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:49.560
 is that healthy or is that unhealthy?

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.600
 It shows that you're not evaporating

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.240
 very much so in an extremely humid

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.680
 climate that wouldn't be so bad but

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.720
 if you're indoors and have a relative humidity of about 50

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.120
 then it means that your metabolism is

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.880
 slow and not producing much heat.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.960
 I see. So you want a certain amount of evaporation

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.240
 when the

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:23.320
 atmosphere is in fact dry.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.400
 Yeah very healthy like

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.680
 12 to 15 year old people

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.840
 burn fuel very wastefully

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:38.320
 but that's when people are the least likely to die is when they're wasting

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.240
 fuel like crazy. So basically

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:46.040
 when you say least likely to what? To die? To die yeah

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.840
 around 12 to 15 people are the healthiest and

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:54.080
 most resistant to stress.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.040
 So Dr. Peat. It's not based on wasting fuel though is it?

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.520
 Yeah it looks like a waste to eat

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.920
 thousands of calories a day when you're not doing anything but it's

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:10.920
 good for you. I see. So a fast metabolism is that what you're saying?

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.000
 Is it a healthier metabolism?

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.600
 Yeah the wasteful energy metabolism.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.560
 Gotcha.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.640
 To answer another question caller

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:28.480
 if you burn or evaporate half of what you drink so you pee out the other half

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.640
 that's pretty much normal in our climate.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:34.960
 Wouldn't you agree Dr. Peat? If you drink

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:40.280
 maybe three quarts of liquid. And you pee out a quart and a half?

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.200
 Yeah.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:47.400
 I see that would be about an average norm.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.920
 Right because we don't have that high humidity like they do in the South.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:54.280
 Okay.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.440
 So you say that we don't have the high... oh okay gotcha gotcha

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.880
 especially during the summertime obviously. Even drier.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:06.000
 Yes. Alright. Real good. Thank you. Thank you for your call.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.720
 Alright let's take the next call. Hi you're on the air? Hello Dr. Peat.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:16.880
 I'm reading... oh this is a fascinating show. Thank you so much.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.040
 Where are you from caller? I'm Southern Humboldt.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:23.400
 Okay. I'm reading that one

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.400
 side effect of anti-anxiety and antidepressant

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:32.040
 drugs is weight gain. Do you know how this works or do you know

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:36.280
 how these drugs work at all?

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:40.120
 If they increase your exposure to serotonin

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.680
 or decrease your adrenaline they'll

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.600
 slow your metabolic rate and

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.440
 make it harder to burn calories.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.480
 Yeah that's interesting. Okay. Thank you so much.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:59.000
 And you know just how...

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.840
 I'm reading also that they don't really...

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.040
 there's no conclusive studies as to

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.840
 relating a low serotonin level with any

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:14.560
 mental state.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.440
 So anyway... Yeah they're not even sure how those

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:22.600
 SSRIs work anyways. Now they're saying that it really doesn't have much to do

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.520
 with serotonin.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.960
 Yeah and they don't have a very good

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:32.360
 way of describing the topography of the receptors and all of that.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.960
 So if you can elucidate

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.200
 any on that I would appreciate it.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.120
 I'll just hang up now and listen. Thank you for your call.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.320
 So Dr. Peat I guess the last question was

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.880
 how are these antidepressants making people feel better

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:55.520
 if it's not... if they are... if it has nothing to do with serotonin

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.600
 increasing or decreasing or anything at all with serotonin?

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.120
 They all work in slightly different ways.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:07.040
 So you have to think about each one

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:11.320
 individually. Maybe we should

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.400
 have a special time to go over

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.120
 some of those specific chemicals.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:23.280
 Okay that sounds great. Okay well thanks for the call as it has been.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.080
 Okay so the lines are open.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:29.360
 From now until 8 o'clock if you live in the area numbers 1 800

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.520
 KMUD Rad. If you live outside the area

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:37.880
 the numbers 923... I beg your pardon if you live outside the area the numbers 1

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.800
 800 KMUD Rad. If you're in the area it's 923 3911.

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.800
 Okay so Dr. Peat

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.920
 just carrying on with the topic of

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:52.600
 the ideal diet that I know you've suggested before

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:57.240
 which I know Sarah deals with quite a lot of people with this and you're

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:01.520
 mentioning the quart of OJ. Do you want to mention

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:05.960
 what you would normally be recommending? Well if you were... if Dr. Peat

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:09.360
 would recommend something like a quart of orange juice, a quart of milk a day

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:15.240
 and you wanted to lose weight, I mean you wouldn't have much room for anything else

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.240
 if you only burn 700 calories a day. Well

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.320
 if you use 1% butterfat milk

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.080
 that's only 400 calories

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:29.280
 per quart where

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.360
 whole milk would be almost twice that much.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.600
 And one of the tricks

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:41.120
 of orange juice is that there are some good chemicals

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.320
 in it which are anti-astrogenic

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:49.560
 and some other fruits, tropical fruits

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.680
 are some of

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:56.120
 the anti-estrogens are very important

00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:01.040
 for the metabolism as well as the

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:04.680
 minerals and type of sugar and such.

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.800
 So there's compounds you're saying in OJ even?

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.840
 Yeah. That are anti-estrogenic?

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:15.600
 Yeah and with milk it isn't just the protein but the calcium

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.680
 is very important as an

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:21.840
 anti-inflammatory, anti-

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:26.240
 stress, anti-depressant

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:30.720
 and so on. People who eat the same

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:34.080
 number of calories without milk

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:37.720
 are much more likely to be fat than the people

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.920
 who are regular milk drinkers.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.880
 Why don't you tell us about your experience when you were in

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.640
 Finland I think it was, Finland and Russia?

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:52.000
 Well, in

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.200
 Russia and Slavic countries in general

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.640
 I found that there was really no

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:02.880
 reliably good milk in the cities

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:06.440
 and the people all had bad teeth

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.480
 and were fat.

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.840
 And food was very cheap but milk

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:17.080
 was scarce and probably proteins in general

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:20.920
 weren't as cheap as the average food.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.240
 But crossing over the border into Finland

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.320
 it was very impressive to see

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:30.600
 how many stores had

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:34.600
 displays of cheese in the window.

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:39.160
 And the people were all healthy looking and slender

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:43.840
 compared to the other side of the border. Well we noticed the same thing in France.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:48.480
 You go to France and everywhere they all eat cheese.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.480
 And for the most part they're all very slender. So I guess what you're saying is that

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.560
 400 calories from orange juice is not

00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:01.720
 comparative to 400 calories from baked potatoes and rice.

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:05.600
 Definitely not. It stimulates your metabolism and suppresses

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:09.920
 the stress hormones. Whereas 400 calories from baked potato and rice would

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:14.040
 increase your stress hormones and suppress your metabolism.

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:18.120
 Yeah. Then there's the matter of the starch particles.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:22.280
 If you don't have some saturated fat with them

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.920
 the starch particles can set up a whole

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:30.840
 pattern of stress and injury by entering your bloodstream.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.040
 Which people

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:39.240
 taking supplements should be very careful to avoid anything with particles

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.800
 such as titanium dioxide or silica.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.920
 Those are very allergenic particles that are in

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.200
 all supplements practically. And those things getting into the bloodstream

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:53.520
 trigger the stress hormones and obesity is

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:59.360
 the least of the things they contribute to. Okay we've got a few more callers on the line

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.160
 Dr. Peat. So let's take this first caller.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.960
 You're on the air and where are you from? Hello?

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:09.880
 Hello you're on the air and where are you from? I've been trying to lose some weight

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:14.040
 and I've been weighing myself periodically

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:18.680
 at night time as well in the morning. And it seems to me that I'm

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:23.080
 I lose about five pounds of weight sleeping.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:27.680
 Some nights I've noticed I've urinated. Sometimes

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.920
 I haven't urinated. It seems always about the same about five pounds.

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.080
 And I'm wondering where this five pounds goes

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:39.080
 if it's with heat and if there's a relationship

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:43.000
 between being cold at night

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.400
 and warm at night. Whether you lose more weight in

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.840
 cooler climates than you would in warmer. Even though warmer

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:55.160
 climate people seem to be thinner than cooler climate people.

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:58.640
 It depends on how you respond to the cold.

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:02.880
 Some people steam up

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.920
 the windows of the bedroom so the window

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.960
 runs water down and

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.960
 collects at the bottom of the window sill

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:18.160
 in the morning. Those are people who lose a lot of weight by evaporation during

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:18.760
 the night.

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:22.240
 You can see the water collecting on the cool

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:27.040
 surfaces. And then people in warmer climates

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.720
 are warmer so their metabolism stay up during the night.

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.840
 And they probably are thinner because of that, right Dr. Peat?

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:38.280
 Yeah. When your body temperature drops

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:43.240
 in the night because you're slowing it down to resist the stress.

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.360
 But if you reach a certain temperature

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:50.760
 you turn on the inflammatory stress-producing

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:56.480
 hormones and so you get not only the darkness but the cold

00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.360
 extremities causing stress.

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:03.400
 It's better to be comfortable if you're actually

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:07.000
 trying to shed weight. It's better to be comfortable at night, correct?

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.040
 Yeah. Okay. So that's reaching the low temperatures you mean, Dr. Peat?

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.160
 Yeah. If your feet

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:19.960
 reach 90 degrees Fahrenheit, they're producing

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:24.280
 toxic stress-inducing substances.

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:28.200
 So don't run around barefoot with cold feet.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.960
 We're always telling our nieces that. Always make sure to get the socks on.

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:34.200
 I know my grandma's always... That's incredible.

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:38.640
 Here it is. An advocate for keeping your feet warm when you get out of bed.

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:41.760
 Cold head. Yeah. Well, cold head and cold feet.

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:46.400
 Some people taking a warm foot bath at bedtime and then putting on

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.400
 warm socks

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.600
 and a wool cap sleep a lot better.

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:55.120
 Okay. We have two more callers. So thanks for your call, caller.

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:59.120
 It's a lot. Hi, next caller. You're on the air?

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.400
 I'm here. Hello? Hello, I'm here.

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:07.400
 Hi. Where are you calling from?

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.560
 Is that me? Yes, it's you. Where are you calling from? I'm calling from

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:15.080
 Phillipsville. Phillipsville. Okay. That's 15 miles up the road.

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:18.600
 Okay. Go ahead. Well, there's a couple of questions I had.

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:22.200
 One, I'm curious. In the beginning, you said something about

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:26.520
 eating food that tastes delicious to you, was good for you, but you didn't say what

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.720
 foods those were.

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:31.760
 It varies with the person, but

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:35.040
 you should try to avoid the

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:40.920
 things that affect your metabolism harmfully, like starches and polyunsaturated

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:41.520
 fats.

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:45.400
 And some plant materials

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:49.000
 are toxic. But otherwise,

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.200
 just what appeals to you... Is it good to eat whole grains like brown rice and millet?

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.720
 No, there's almost nothing of value in those.

00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.840
 Even if it's not processed?

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:04.680
 I don't mean like white rice. Well, the white rice

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:09.080
 is relatively free of irritants and toxins,

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:12.480
 but it has very little of food value in it.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:17.160
 Well, I thought brown rice had a lot of vitamins and fiber and things that were good for you.

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:21.160
 Not compared to, say, orange juice.

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:25.960
 How about ice cream? You know, a good ice cream that doesn't have chemicals in it, like

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.080
 Haagen-Dazs or something.

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.360
 Is that good for you or not? I mean, it's got high calories.

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:33.560
 Yeah, I mean, if you're trying to lose weight, then I wouldn't recommend you eat ice cream.

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:37.280
 But if you're not trying to lose weight, you're happy with your weight, and you're

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.360
 having trouble sleeping, it can help a lot of people

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.720
 go to sleep. Milk and sugar is a bad food combination.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.800
 Uh-huh. I heard that... No, I wouldn't agree with that at all, Jordan.

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:52.280
 If you have, like, some cheese or a small glass of milk or something, that there's something

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.880
 in that that helps you sleep?

00:53:53.880 --> 00:54:00.000
 Yeah, milk contains a good balance all in itself, because it has some

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.960
 fat, some protein, and some sugar. Well, I don't drink milk, but I do put half and half in my coffee in the morning.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:06.760
 Does that count?

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:10.360
 I didn't hear that.

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:15.960
 I said I don't usually drink milk by itself, but I put half and half in my coffee in the morning.

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.480
 Does that count?

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.680
 Well, no, that's mostly cream.

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:25.040
 Well, and that's not good? I mean, it's fats, cream, and milk.

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:32.920
 Well, it's okay if it goes with other food, such as protein and sugars.

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:37.800
 Now, you mentioned orange juice a lot, but what other fruit juices?

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:45.080
 I tend to really enjoy other fruit juices, like berry juice and peach juice and carrot juice and

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:51.160
 cherry juice and all kinds of different juices, you know, that don't have sugar in them.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:55.440
 And I tend to drink them like half diluted with water, so they're not so strong.

00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:02.040
 But I've had people tell me that it's not good for me because it has too much sugar in it and too many calories.

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:07.360
 So what do you think about juices other than orange juice?

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:10.560
 Many juices are good.

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:17.920
 It's the minerals and antioxidants, as well as the sugar that are important.

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:27.040
 But grapefruit juice, for example, has a chemical that causes your liver to increase estrogen in the body.

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:35.760
 Oh, no, I don't mean grapefruit juice. I'm thinking of, you know, like apricot juice, peach juice, berry juice, grape juice, those kinds.

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:44.320
 Grape juice is very good as long as you consider the calories. It has more concentrated calories than orange juice.

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:48.920
 Some tropical fruits are very good. Guava, for example.

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.560
 Mango.

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:59.440
 Carrot juice is another one that should be avoided, except in small amounts because of the high carotene content.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.360
 It's very metabolically suppressive.

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.920
 Oh, it is?

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:07.000
 It antagonizes both thyroid and progesterone.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.080
 What's good for thyroid?

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:18.920
 You know, what's good for like stimulating your metabolism so that you, you know, you burn calories quicker, but you know, you won't have an overactive thyroid.

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:24.240
 Milk, cheese and some of the fruit juices are the best things.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:29.800
 Right. So 400 calories from fruit juice isn't going to be the same as eating 400 calories of brown rice.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:36.480
 The 400 calories of brown rice is going to be much more metabolically suppressive than the 400 calories from fruit juice.

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:40.320
 Yeah. Thank you for your call. But it is a couple of minutes to the top of the hour.

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:44.360
 And I want to make sure that the listeners who are tuned in get to know Dr.

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:49.200
 Raymond Peat's contact details. So unfortunately, we've come to the end of this show, Dr.

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:53.640
 Peat. Thanks so much for your input and your your wisdom.

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.160
 And I'm sorry we couldn't get to you.

00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.160
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:59.240
 They had two more callers on the line, but I'm afraid we couldn't we couldn't get you.

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:01.440
 Join us next month, March 15th.

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:04.720
 So those people have listened to us and Dr.

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:17.000
 Raymond Peat most especially his contact details at WWW dot Ray Peat dot com full of us as what we would call scientific articles, folks.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:23.360
 So not just hearsay, not just things that he's come up with, but a lot of his articles are fully referenced.

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:30.760
 So there's plenty of science behind it. And that's  R.A.Y.P.E.A.T. Dotcom.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:37.600
 OK, so lots of articles there for people to read. And even the subject we've mentioned this evening, there's plenty of information there.

00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:44.360
 So thanks again for all the callers. And we can also be reached toll free Monday through Friday.
