WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 Well, welcome to the Get Fit with Jodell show. I am Jodell as usual and Dr. Peat has honored

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.600
 us with his presence on the podcast yet again and I, as I am sure you are thrilled just

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.000
 like I am every time we get a chance to talk with him. So it's a treat, Dr. Peat. So thank

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 you and what's new in your world currently?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Oh, I've been writing a newsletter on vaccinations, sort of the history of vaccination and explaining

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 some of the physiological points that are being misrepresented.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 I am so excited to read that because I'm pretty passionate about wanting to know all of the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 logistics about vaccinations as well. I've been looking into it for many years so I'll

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 be really anxious to read that. And you know, we love hearing from you and supporting you

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 and so for those of you out there listening who haven't signed up for his newsletter that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 he's talking about, which by the way will blow your hair back when you read it and each

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 time it comes out I just get excited. So I highly encourage you guys to sign up for that

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 newsletter as it is a way to show your support and appreciation for Dr. Peat and how generous

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 he is with his knowledge and coming on the podcast. So to do that you can send an email

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 to RayPeatsNewsletter, all one word, at gmail.com and to sign up for that newsletter. It's just

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 real easy and it gives your support to him as well. And if you're new to listening to

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 the podcast you can read an amazing plethora of research-based articles that Dr. Peat has

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 written at RayPeat.com. That's R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com. So without further ado, we had such a good

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 podcast last time where people got to write in and ask questions and it was really well

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 received so we decided to do that again. So we've got quite a slew of questions that people

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 have written in. So I thank you for posting your questions. We'll get to as many as the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 hour allows and I might even have a few of my own to toss in there, Dr. Peat. So this

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 will be fun. The first question comes from Reba and she asks, "Dr. Peat, how can someone

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 get rid of endotoxins in the body since we know how detrimental they are?"

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 A fiber diet such as a raw carrot, if you shred a carrot fairly fine and add maybe olive

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 oil and a little vinegar and salt, it's a pleasant enough food that you can eat it every

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 day and it happens that the carrot contains a germicidal but harmless substance. Root

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 vegetables growing underground have to resist mold and bacteria attacks and that material

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 has the same disinfectant effect in the intestine. Olive oil and vinegar also have a germicidal

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 effect. So the salad is a good protective daily stimulating food. The bulk stimulates

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 the intestine so generally the transit time is reduced if you eat a raw carrot every day.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 The average American, according to one survey, had I think it was a three day transit time.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 The average person in Africa had less than a one day transit time. But if you can get

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 your intestinal activity increased, that in itself has benefits far beyond reducing the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 endotoxin because your liver is constantly processing toxins and hormones, especially

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 estrogen, is instantly inactivated when it reaches the liver. Some of it goes into the

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 bile, some of it is eliminated through the kidneys. But the estrogen in the bile, if

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 you don't have enough fiber in your intestine, the estrogen can be reabsorbed and returned

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 to the liver. When the liver is exposed to too much estrogen, it slows down and loses

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 its ability to detoxify estrogen. So having a good flow of fiber through your intestine

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 not only suppresses the endotoxin, but it binds the bile and the estrogen content of

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 the bile, preventing it from reabsorption. So any kind of fiber has that anti-estrogen

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 effect, but raw carrot is a very safe one.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 So when you said salad, you're talking the raw carrot salad, not necessarily a dark,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 leafy green salad, right?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 No, I did an experiment putting lettuce in a closed plastic bag to imitate the intestine

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 absence of oxygen and kept it at about 80 or 90 degrees in the intestine. That's close

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 to almost 100 degrees Fahrenheit. But even keeping it around 90 degrees, after two or

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 three days, the lettuce was just horribly rotten, supported a terrible bacterial growth

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 and was stinky and foul smelling. And since we don't have enzymes to break down cellulose,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 that same kind of process happens when you eat a raw, leafy material such as lettuce.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Yeah, so stick to just the raw carrot salad if you really want to remove those endotoxins,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 right?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Yeah, but you can get fairly safe fibers in other ways. For example, well-cooked oat bran

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 is a pretty functional alternative, although research in Australia found that chronic use

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 of oat bran itself has some estrogenic and carcinogenic effects on the intestine.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 What about, I know you're a big fan of coconut products, but what about coconut flour? Because

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 that's pretty high in fiber, but I guess they dehydrate the coconut and process it down

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 into a flour. What do you think about that?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 In studies in pigs, it didn't work so well. It supports either bacterial or fungal growth.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 That's interesting, since most other coconut products we can trust in, because they actually

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 help mitigate some of the fungus and yeast in the colon, right?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Yeah, coconut oil, if it's oil refined and clean, is a good fungicide.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Okay, great. Well, she also had another question. She said, "What does Dr. Peat think about

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 bone broth, specifically chicken broth?"

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Oh, that's one of my favorites. Necks, wings, and feet are all high in collagen. And if

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 you cook them thoroughly and then let it stand and skim off the fat, then that's very good

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 high collagen food.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Okay, I've done the wings and the neck. I've never done the feet, so now I'm going to do

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 the feet.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 You have to be careful getting them from a farmer that you know, because a big processor

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 is likely to have processed the chickens with antiseptics, and sometimes the feet soak

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 up a lot of the antiseptic.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 That would be true, yes. That seems about right, considering our society nowadays and

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 what they do to our meat systems. Okay, so Ben asks, "What about weight training for

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 bone density?" He mentioned that you said that weight training, you know, various moves are

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 efficient, but do we need to do regular weight training for bone density, or is there something

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 else we can do?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 The diet really is the main thing. Keeping your stress levels low and your activity comfortable

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 doesn't have to be anything special, because stress involves several things that interfere

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 with bone repair and renewal. Even a deficiency of salt, a low salt diet, can create stress

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 that harms the bone. So old people being told to keep their salt down for blood pressure

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 control, that's adding to their stress, increasing adrenaline, bringing up the parathyroid hormone

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 that goes down the bone. Keeping a very, very high ratio of calcium to phosphate in your

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 diet is helpful, because that helps to suppress the parathyroid hormone. And the parathyroid

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 hormone blocks the use of oxygen in all of your tissues, and that leads to the production

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 of lactic acid in the bone, which dissolves the bone and contributes in the long run to

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 osteoporosis. But that same bone-destroying effect lowers the energy production in all

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 of our cells, so a high calcium intake increases our metabolic rate and efficient oxidative

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 metabolism all through the body, not just the bone.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 Would you also say that these individuals, or all of us, would want to be outside in

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 the sun? Will that help with bone density as well?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Yeah, the vitamin D, the older person is the less cholesterol the skin contains, and it's

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 the ultraviolet light interacting with the cholesterol that makes vitamin D. So a person,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 especially a dark-skinned person, but anyone over the age of 50, needs a lot more exposure

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 to sunlight to get their vitamin D level up adequately.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 Okay, and I like how last time you mentioned chopping wood is actually a really great form

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 of exercise, so that would be a way to increase bone density I would think too.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 Yeah, it's something that feels productive, and isn't stress-inducing. Just by the word

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 of it, you can see the product of your labor, and that is anti-stress.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 I love that. Okay, so Sergei asks, "I'd very much like to know how Dr. Peat would recommend

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 to deal with insulin resistance and early type 2 diabetes. Should one be afraid of elevated

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 blood glucose after saying goodbye to low-carb or keto?"

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 You know, the chronic stress elevates the free fatty acids in the blood. Women in particular

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 have the problem of chronically high free fatty acids because estrogen causes a great

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 activation of the growth hormone, which is a major producer of free fatty acids. And

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 it's free fatty acids in general, and especially unsaturated free fatty acids, that interfere

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 with the use of glucose. So keeping your fat intake low is somewhat helpful, but any fat

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 -- anything that lowers stress, lowers estrogen, is going to increase your insulin sensitivity,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 increase your ability to use glucose. Everything that lowers stress tends to lower estrogen

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 and improves your ability to use oxygen productively, converting sugar to carbon dioxide. When you're

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 stressed or high estrogen or have too much free fatty acid in the blood, any sugar that's

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 present tends to produce lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide. And lactic acid itself

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 has many toxic ketogenic effects.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 So I've heard a lot of people who went keto for a vast amount of time are now saying that

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 they're having insulin resistance, and even some have been diagnosed as type 2 diabetics.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 So it sounds like the stress of going into ketosis is part of the problem that's creating

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 almost this diabetic effect on these individuals.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 The ketogenic diet is always stress-promoting, and that means that it's diabetes-ogenic to

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 some extent. It isn't really -- the diet that produces ketosis isn't strictly generating

00:14:49.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 ketones. The hydroxybutyrate is included as a ketone, but it's actually an alcohol, not

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 a ketone. And studies that have looked at the difference between actual ketosis and

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 the presence of a high proportion of hydroxybutyrate shows that the hydroxybutyrate stimulates

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 cancer growth and other stress-related things. So if you had an artificial source of ketones

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 that were real ketones, that would probably be very beneficial. But when you generate

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 them yourself, you're under stress and you're creating a cancer-promoting degenerative type

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 of situation.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 Okay, so I'm picking up a trend in your talking is that the stress is the main cause. I mean

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 in all the podcasts we've done, you always go back to you've got to reduce the stress,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 you've got to calm down the stress in the body. So one of my personal questions I'd

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 like to ask you is what is your favorite way to de-stress, like kind of in your life? How

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 do you like to de-stress?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 Playing a musical instrument or painting or just doing anything interesting. If there's

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 wood to chop, that's a good activity.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 Yeah, but I can see how when we dial that stress reduction in, a lot of these things

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 we're talking about today, that's when we're going to see them get reduced as well, right?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Yeah, the culture is designed pretty much to keep people under maximum stress. Sort

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 of like idle hens are likely to get in trouble and so the economy is designed to keep everyone

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 under maximum stress so that they don't get in trouble, but naturally it doesn't work

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 that way.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 Yeah, they're not getting in trouble in society, they're getting in trouble in their health

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 and so what's wrong with just taking a blanket outside on the grass and laying on it and

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 watching the clouds go by? I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but we just don't

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 take the time to do that.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Yeah, when the weather's good.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 Okay, moving on, I've got a little sidetrack there because I love hearing your thoughts

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 on stress, but a YouTube listener writes, this was an anonymous person, said, "Please

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 address how this all applies, this being the stress mitigation," and actually they were

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 talking within regards to adrenal insufficiency. Someone who does not produce enough cortisol,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 he says, "All I hear on different podcasts is that cortisol is evil and must be reduced,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 but a certain amount of cortisol is necessary for our bodies, isn't it? And without any

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 cortisol we would die, so can you address those who have low cortisol and how to balance

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 that in a right ratio?"

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Yeah, out of thousands of people that I've seen their blood tests, I've only seen one

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 or two that actually were deficient in cortisol. On their own, they're diagnosed as having

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 an adrenal deficiency of some sort, but when you look at their blood tests, they're doing

00:18:48.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 fine on cortisol, but the adrenals use cholesterol to turn it into trigonalone and then into

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 DHA and progesterone, and cortisol and aldosterone are increased by almost any stress, and only

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 a very small fraction of your trigonalone or cholesterol or progesterone makes it into

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 cortisol, so there has to be a great deficiency of cholesterol, trigonalone and progesterone,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 before you experience an actual deficiency of cholesterol. And by the time you reach

00:19:47.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 a real deficiency of cortisol, you're experiencing a whole range of symptoms and problems from

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 low trigonalone and low progesterone. You can tolerate lots of stress-induced cortisol

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 if it's backed up with plenty of trigonalone, progesterone and DHA, so a person doesn't

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 have to worry about their stress if they have lots of these anti-stress buffer hormones.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Would that be something that they would want to look into supplementing, if they, you know,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 considering taking a pregnenolone supplement if they find that they have very low cortisol?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 Yeah, it will. In experiments on rats 60 years ago, they looked at the hormone level of all

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 the rats they were experimenting with, and some of them were under stress from the handling

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 and such, and they had higher than average cortisol, and then they gave them all the

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 equivalent for a person would be a cup full of powdered pregnenolone that filled their

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 stomachs, I think it was 10 gram dose per rat, just a gigantic dose so that they couldn't

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 eat anything for a few hours. But there were no changes in their steroid hormones except

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 the ones who were under stress to start with. It brought their cortisol down to normal,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 so you can't push upstream in the adrenals. The more pregnenolone or progesterone you

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 take, the more normal you become. It's the end point hormones that are produced normally

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 only in extreme situations like aldosterone, estrogen, and cortisol. These are dealing

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 with specific problems. If you supplement those beyond what the body would be making,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 then you have potential problems with all of them.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 Okay, so that might be some good advice for that listener who maybe needs to increase

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 their cortisol, that might be thinking about supplementing pregnenolone might be an easy

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 fix right at first.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 Yeah, there was a well-known book about 20 or 30 years ago on the natural use of hydrocortisone

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 or cortisol. His examples, the data that he based it on were very good examples showing

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 that a tiny supplement like 5 or 10 micrograms of cortisol could improve a woman's menstrual

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 cycle, for example. But I happen to know some of his patients who he was giving what he

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 called a physiological dose of natural cortisol. And after two or three months, they all started

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 getting puffy faces, typical of Cushing's disease. That was on a 20 milligram per day

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 dose, in divided doses, which is what the body normally makes. But if you supplement

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 that, it can be risky.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 Okay, well said. Next question is from Leanne and she asks, "What would be a good strategy

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 to help with my immune system? I recently found out I have cytomegalovirus expressed

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 and also Epstein-Barr virus and I would like to increase my body's immune function.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 What do you say to that, Dr. Peate?"

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 Probably the majority of people have those viruses and so it's a matter of keeping them

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 from expressing themselves and keeping your ability to handle stress optimized is the

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 most important thing. And when you look at studies of general infections, not just those,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 but the more serious infections, polio, or all of the things that they vaccinate for,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 like the colds and mumps and so on, if you supplement vitamin A and vitamin D along those

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 two vitamins are just about as effective as a huge vaccination campaign. And the viruses

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 that are present in the majority of people aren't doing any harm if their immune system

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 is okay. But for example, if you're overweight, your blood level might seem to show a normal

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 amount of vitamin A and vitamin D. But your tissues can be very deficient and the person

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 will benefit from bringing their vitamin D and vitamin A, among other nutrients, up to

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 a functional level. With vitamin D serum, a level of 50 or 60 nanograms per milliliter

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 corresponds to a low rate of diabetes, various infections, flu infections practically disappear

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 when the person keeps their blood level at least at 50 nanograms per milliliter.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 I was just, actually I did a podcast with Jordi Dinkoff earlier today and we were talking

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 about vitamin D and I was mentioning how I was recently in Hawaii and I noticed that

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 after talking to a couple of my friends that live there, they don't have a cold and flu

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 season and I wonder if that is part of the reason why they get vitamin D every day from

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 ample sun in Hawaii and I wonder if just keeping their levels up is keeping the whole state

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 from having a cold and flu season.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 Yeah, I've known several people who used to have maybe five episodes every fall and winter

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 of colds or flu when they started taking vitamin D, not another episode from multiple cases

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 every year to none in several years.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 It makes sense, you know, we need sun for a reason and so even if we can't get it, we

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 can supplement the sun and so that sounds like it's pretty important. As far as like

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 other immune boosters, what do you think about colostrum?

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 That probably is helpful in an emergency situation but I don't think you need it. Magnesium

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 is another nutrient that many people are deficient in. If your diet has too much phosphate, you

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 just can't get enough calcium and magnesium to balance it and if your thyroid is low,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 your cells don't retain magnesium and the magnesium deficiency opens up your immune

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 system to develops of these invention of viruses, herpes, epsom bar and so on.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 And what about your thoughts on like monolaurin which is like from lauric acid, like from

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 coconut oil, I know people use that as kind of an immune system booster.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 The guy who was not realizing that about 10 or 15 years ago asked me to join in the campaign

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 to promote it but I asked him if there had been any safety studies of it and he got laughy

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 and said I was anti-scientific but I've looked for safety studies and I'm not convinced those

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 things, any of the lipid things that are germicidal, they can also be disturbing to our digestive

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 system.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 Okay, good to know because you hear people talk about that and you'll read reviews on

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 certain things and you just don't know until you talk to somebody who knows like you so

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 that's good.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 When we eat a fat like butter or coconut oil that is in the triglyceride form and our digestive

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 system is very well equipped to handle quite a bit of that natural triglyceride fat and

00:29:45.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 it breaks the particles up into tiny chylomicron particles and those will pass into the lymphatic

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 system.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 The chylomicrons are formed only when you have the right amount of the right type of

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 triglycerides and if you put other emulsifying things or very abnormal lipids it can disrupt

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 our ability to make chylomicrons and since the chylomicrons are a major pathway for absorbing

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 vitamins A, K, D and E, if you disturb the chylomicrons for too long then you can get

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 deficient in the fatty vitamins.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 Okay, next question comes from another anonymous person and they said with kidney issues such

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 as frequent urination and seeming to dump all my minerals daily with frequent bouts

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 of urination, what do you suggest to calm down the kidneys and also help them to function

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 more optimally?

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 The two hormones most protective for the kidneys are progesterone and thyroid and the vitamins

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 that I've just been mentioning, especially vitamin D, is extremely protective for the

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 kidneys and making sure that you get the essential minerals, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 in a generous amount every day is protective for the kidneys.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 Drinking too much water rather than milk or juices, the water can, as she said, wash the

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 minerals out of you just by not providing, it fills up your stomach and satisfies your

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 thirst but it doesn't provide any nutrients so it's better only to drink water when you're

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 thirsty.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 Milk, juice and coffee are accompanied by some essential nutrients in each one.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Okay, and are you a fan of coconut water?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 Oh, if you open up a fresh green coconut it's very nice but I don't press any of it commercially

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 sold because I've seen some of it containing a preservative but I imagine if you're sure

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 it doesn't have a preservative and it's just a pasteurized and bottled it's probably good.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 Okay, very good.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 Okay, Allison asks, can white willow bark be taken instead of aspirin?

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 It works for some people but it does have other ingredients so the tannin type substance

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 in the herb can be irritating to the intestines so it's pretty much a personal matter whether

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 it works for you.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 Okay, and just briefly in case people are new to your thoughts on aspirin, can you tell

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 people just a few thoughts about how you feel that aspirin is beneficial?

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 I know it's kind of a new school of thought in today's world even for me as a nutritionist

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 when I had first heard you say that, never was I taught that in nutrition, the training

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 that I went through and so once you told me the benefits it made total sense but I'd like

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 for the listeners to hear you say that.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 It has many functions, anti-inflammatory functions but the thing that has been studied most is

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 blocking the production of prostaglandins and those are formed from any inflammation tends

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 to trigger the formation of these short-acting hormones but all of them have some very harmful

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 side effects besides what they primarily do, most of them are simply amplifiers of the

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 inflammation and they're produced in the brain, in the every organ, heart and so on.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 In response to a minor trigger of inflammation, so they're produced in proportion to the amount

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 of polyunsaturated fat incorporated into all of these tissues and as we age, increasing

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 sharply in the teens as our growth slows down so that our metabolic rate slows and we aren't

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 diluting them or oxidizing them as fast as a baby does, from about the age of 20 we very

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 efficiently keep adding polyunsaturated fatty acids into our tissue structures so that from

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 the age of 20 to 40 we're probably doubling the amount of PUFA in our tissues and PUFA

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 is what converts to prostaglandins in the event of inflammation.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 So a fetus or a newborn baby heals an injury without scars and all through childhood injuries

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 heal very, very quickly and with relatively little inflammation but as the PUFA in their

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 tissue accumulates wounds heal more slowly, cause more inflammation and leave scars that

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 are interfering with function.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 Whenever you have a systemic inflammation producing lactic acid and prostaglandins,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 both of these are increasing the deposition of collagen in the tissues so with aging the

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 body becomes approaching something like a big scar with a very high collagen content.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 The difference between a kid's skin, gloves and leather boots is a matter of the age of

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 the animal.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 An old animal has a very thick leathery skin because of the high collagen content and all

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 of these inflammation related things, prostaglandins or lactic acid contribute to that age process

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 of thickening of the tissues and aspirin by blocking prostaglandins and several other

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 inflammatory mechanisms is an important protection from inflammation and aging.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 Yeah and I think my favorite feature too is that it helps to lower excess cortisol, is

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 that correct?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 Yeah, it lowers the pituitary ACTH production and ACTH also brings up the adrenal albastron

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 which contributes to the collagen production of aging and deterioration in general.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 So not just protecting against cortisol but a whole range of degenerative processes.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Wonderful, okay so now we know the benefits of aspirin.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Nick asks, I've been taking cod liver oil pills for vitamin A and vitamin D. He says

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 in a previous interview to avoid fish oils which I've never heard before so does that

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 include cod liver oil, should I stop?

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 Well cod liver oil at least is giving you an A, which is beneficial if you don't have

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 another source but I think it's good to use a fish oil derived vitamin A and D if most

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 of the other fish oils have been removed because studies of the taste of ingested fish oil

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 are very interesting.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 If you look at them just in a bottle, I did experiments with a bottle of unsaturated oils,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 put a rubber tube in the bottle and put the other end of the rubber tube in water and

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 every day the water climbed up the rubber tube because of the oxygen consumption of

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 the unsaturated fat.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 Fish oils are extremely quick to react with oxygen and in these studies they found that

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 before they reached the bloodstream the majority of them had been oxidized and they were very

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 quick to be stored if they had made it into the bloodstream.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 With aging the brain accumulates these oxidizable fatty acids but the oxidation continues in

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 the brain and the neural prostate is what they call the breakdown product when they

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 happen in the brain.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 The neural prostate in other tissues is the randomly produced equivalent of the prostaglandins.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 The neural prostates are made from the type of fatty acid that predominates in fish oils

00:40:51.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 but before they reach storage a very large part of these fish oils are already oxidized

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 and they are immunosuppressive.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 A toxic effect on the immune system can temporarily reduce inflammation by damaging the cells

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 that would react to harm.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 So for about six months they are anti-inflammatory by blocking some of the immediate inflammatory

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 reactions of the immune system but after that the immune deficiencies start showing up and

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 the animals experimented on with fish oils then became more susceptible to all kinds

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 of infections.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 I guess even all throughout my years of doing nutrition consults I was never comfortable

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 promoting fish oils just for the mere fact of if you think logically about how much processing

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 it has to go through to get the oil out of a fish into a capsule it just doesn't seem

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 logical that that oil would then retain all of the nutrient value to go in someone's body

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 and be beneficial.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 So I just really struggled with promoting that.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 I just told people you know eat fish and get your fish naturally.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 Historically it was made of very good varnish because it oxidizes so thoroughly and if you

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 imagine that happening in your body you don't want to have varnished blood vessels.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 So if you have any leftover fish oil at home just start using it as varnish for your furniture

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 at home.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 Don't ingest it.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 Yes I agree.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 Okay so Victoria asks can women who are vegans or vegetarians successfully follow Dr. Peat's

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 nutritional guidelines and maintain a healthy menstrual cycle?

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 It happens that the only non-animal proteins that are really adequate for human needs are

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 potatoes and mushrooms and you can thrive as far as protein goes with either potatoes

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 or mushrooms and mushrooms happen to generally have more of the trace minerals than potatoes

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 so you can get your iron from the mushrooms and all of the other nutrients except B12

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 and vitamin A from potatoes and some people said that mushrooms can provide B12.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 I'm not sure if that's adequate bacteria in the intestines will make vitamin B12 and so

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 vitamin A is the main problem and carotene if your thyroid function is good and you have

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 vitamin B12 those are needed for converting carotene into the actual vitamin A which is

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 needed for making progesterone which is essential for maintaining good periods.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 So the problem becomes that so many vegetables block your thyroid function.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 As long as you can keep your thyroid functioning and have vitamin B12 then you can convert

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 carotene adequately to vitamin A to make your hormones.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 And as far as like for vegans or vegetarians would something like nutritional yeast would

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 that bring in some B vitamins since it is kind of high in B12?

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 Oh yeah but potatoes and mushrooms are very rich in all of the vitamins all the nutrients

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 except for iron and vitamin A and sometimes B12 might be a limiting factor.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 And as far as like are there foods you know you hear people talk about yams and things

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 like that that promote estrogen but do you think that there's actually foods that can

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 naturally promote progesterone do you think that there's foods that can naturally promote

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 more progesterone in the body?

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 No, only things that provide energies, sodium, calcium and sugar are necessary for making

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 the thyroid that you need to make the progesterone but there are no foods that directly go to

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 the progesterone system.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 Okay, good to know.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 That's kind of my thoughts too I was like I didn't I wasn't really convinced of the

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 whole yam thing being a promoter of progesterone I didn't see how one food could be a promoter.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 I've noticed that the yam story people were trying to sell yams as a progesterone promoter

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 but the crude sterol in yams is actually estrogenic and very toxic.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 Russell Marker who developed the production of progesterone from yams at one point decided

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 to try the raw yam powder to see what it would do and the next morning he said he looked

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 like he'd been run over by a truck it was all black and blue and it had broken so many

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 blood vessels that he was bleeding internally.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 It's very dangerous stuff in the crude form.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 Okay, good to know.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 Elisa asks what does Dr. Peat think of stevia?

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 Oh, very sweet but I'm not sure it's safe to use to try to regulate your blood pressure

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 in a pinch it can lower blood pressure but I don't think there's any real problem with

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 hypertension if you're eating well and keeping your thyroid function alright.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 Hypothyroidism is almost always behind hypertension.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 Other nutritional deficiencies can sometimes do it.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 A magnesium deficiency or a vitamin D deficiency sometimes but usually it's just a low thyroid problem.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 Yeah, and I remember reading there's a few studies linked to infertility with stevia

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 and it got my wheels turning thinking well maybe it's because these people are swapping

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 out sugar for stevia and good forms of sugar could be the reason why it would help just

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 promote a system that's making more progesterone for fertility or other sex hormones and so

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 perhaps that would be the reason why they were infertile is they kind of gave up on

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 the good natural sugars.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 That could be it.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 Okay, now we're towards the end so I had one question I threw in here at the end and

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 it's kind of a personal one again I like to learn about you so I have a question for you.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 I would love to know do you have a favorite quick and easy recipe that you love and that

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 you would like to share with us?

00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 Oh, not one in particular but I have at different times make a lot of custards or when I was

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 confident that there were safe sources of powdered milk I had a recipe for making pancakes

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 and I have an anti-casing agent which can be toxic but I'm experimenting with recipes

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 using masa, mixed with corn and that's a very safe and digestible way to use a cereal.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 The processing in lime eliminates most of the toxins and breaks down the protein and

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 starch so that they're very digestible, non-toxic.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 Would that then be kind of like a grits almost?

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 Yep, same idea, hominid grits, tamales, tortillas.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 And so do you have kind of a recipe that you're working on now with the masa?

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 Yeah, I'm just trying out different ways of handling it but the traditional, pretty much

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 the Central Americans developed I think all of the best recipes, quesadillas for example.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 And how do you do your custard?

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 I know you mentioned custard a minute ago.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 Yeah, just eggs, milk, sugar and vanilla.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 Okay, that sounds easy enough. I might have to try that.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 Uh huh, sure.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 Okay, well that's the questions that we had on tap for today so I thank you once again
