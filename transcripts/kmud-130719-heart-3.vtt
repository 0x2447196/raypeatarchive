00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Well, here we are, July 2013. Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 I guess I should preface the introduction to this show by saying that I'm just not used to doing this solo at this point in time.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Sarah has joined us for the last, oh, I don't know, four or five, six years now.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 So she's busy looking after our little beautiful baby girl.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 And so I'm just going to read the introduction just as if she were here, but it just doesn't sound right to do it as an individual.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 So my name's Andrew Murray.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England, graduating there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 And we run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUG Garboville, 91.1 FM.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with questions either related or unrelated to this month's continuing subject of the heart hormones.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 And hopefully we'll get into Dr. Peat's recent work on cataracts, aging, degeneration, swelling, et cetera.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 So that's something to look forward to for sure.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 So the number here, if you live in the area, is 923-3911.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD. That's 1-800-568-3723.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 We can also be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBM-HERB for consultations or further information after the show Monday through Friday, 9 to 5.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, are you with us?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Yeah, but there's a terrific hum on the line. I can hardly hear you.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Ah.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 When she switched it over, it started buzzing.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Oh dear, I can kind of hear it myself through my headphones. It doesn't sound that loud to me, but it's still very loud to you?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Yeah, it's louder than you are.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Yeah. Sue, is there anything that you know you can do?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 I'll call him back in a different line.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Okay. All right. So, I think basically Dr. Peat is going to be called back on a different line.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 I think there's another VIP line that he can be called on just to make sure that we can get a decent call from him.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Okay, so I wanted to carry on the last month, or in fact the last couple of months, because the subject is so broad that it's very difficult to try and sum it up that quickly.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 And there's always spin-off questions that get asked, you know, after the show's finished.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 So, during the weeks following, we get callers from people interested about the previous month's subject,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 and they ask questions themselves surrounding the subject.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 So, it seems to have been consistently evolving into a fairly large subject.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 So, the subject of edema and wetness in general as a term, as opposed to dryness, wetness of the tissue.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 And I know Dr. Peat's always mentioned that tumors, when they arise, are generally solid, but actually they have a higher than average water content.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 And so that was part of later on this show's discussion into eye changes, mentioning things like age-related macular degeneration in particular in glaucoma.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Also having very high water concentrations, and that being an interesting component, along with estrogens, devastating effects.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 I can't say enough about estrogen and how bad it is for women.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 We've done many shows regarding estrogen in the past.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 And again, it'll bring up the kind of sinister side of estrogen, if you like.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 And we've mentioned before many times that the only real function for estrogen is for implantation of a fertilized ovum.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Outside of that, it wreaks quite a lot of havoc in the female body.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 It also does nothing very good in the male body.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 But especially with females, the advancing age in estrogen is a very negative and inflammatory molecule.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 So we'll bring out tonight's subject of estrogen in that context, linking it to HRT and that kind of stuff.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Okay, so I don't know how Dr. Peat is, or whether he can hear us any better than the previous line.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Both the hum and your voice got weaker.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 But you still have a hum on the line?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Yeah.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Yeah. Are you going to be able to manage it? Because I'm not too sure the engineer can hear you.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Yeah, if you talk like this.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Yeah. Okay, good. So you can hear me okay?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Yeah.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Okay, good. All right. Well, thanks for bearing with us.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 As usual, people haven't heard of you before, surprisingly enough.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 I know you're pretty well known across the web in terms of your articles and the work that you've been doing for 30 or more years in the field of health and hormones and your PhD research.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 So for the benefit of those people perhaps who have never heard your name before, would you just outline your academic background?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Several years after I got my master's degree in the humanities area, I went back to graduate school in 1968, studied biology and biochemistry for a PhD in 1972.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 Okay.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 That's pretty much the relevant stuff.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 All right. Fine. Let's leave it at that.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Okay. So just carrying on from the last two shows, been talking quite a lot about interwoven subjects from the heart's mechanism, its pumping action, how it's inhibited.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 We've woven in things mentioning the estrogen in many different ways about how damaging it is and how it affects physiology in a very negative way.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 I wanted just to cover the -- and I know we have done this before in the past, maybe a year or more ago,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 but the very real and present danger of the environmental estrogens that we're exposed to from plastics and things like BPA.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 What do you know more especially about these things in terms of their negative impact?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 I couldn't really hear that.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Okay. I'll ask again. We'll see if we can make this work or not.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 The damaging effects of environmental estrogens that are found in such compounds as BPA and other plastics that have a hormone mimicking effects.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Yeah. When the organism is exposed at a very early stage such as during gestation or infancy, the signals for development are changed so that the --

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 especially the reproductive system is changed. But besides changing the individual by giving it false signals,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 the DNA is altered slightly by attaching methyl groups to it as part of that misguided development.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 And that means that the ability to express enzymes for the rest of its life will be influenced unless it can somehow remove those methyl groups.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 But typically they will last for three or four generations even without further change.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 So the changes that happen to one individual can be passed on for generations altering the fertility, for example,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 until it can tend to cause the species to just disappear.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 Okay. So what's your opinion about the amount of pollution that we are as an organism exposed to directly

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 from estrogenic-like substances in the environment?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 What we know about certain areas, the Columbia River and the ocean off the mouth of the Columbia, for example,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 they're seeing lots of fish, simpler water organisms, even mammals that are sexually malformed and developing tumors.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 And in Florida there have been a lot of stories about the swamp animals that are becoming sterile.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Changing genders and so on.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 So the news reported about human health I think isn't being up to date or honestly reported

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 because what we see in the wild animals I think undoubtedly is affecting humans to a great degree too.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 I think this could be so widespread and so endemic that it's almost impossible for anyone to put a lid on it

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 and that's why it's not being exposed as much as it should be?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Yeah, because of the influence of the estrogen industry there's a terrific reluctance to admit that estrogen has these toxic effects

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 even though it's been known for a hundred years.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 It's only in the last 10 or 15 years that people have really been researching in an organized way influences

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 such as these environmental plastic chemicals and so on.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 And the influence of the estrogen industry is simply going to blame any effects they see on such things as diet,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 smoking too much, bad way of living and so on.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 Yeah, rather than the root cause.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 Well I hope so. I mean last month was a testimony especially for me having a reasonably close working relationship with you

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 over the last few years doing this show that you've been consistently mentioning how bad polyunsaturates are

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 and finally it showed up in the medical literature that indeed what you've been saying is very true.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 And so I know you've also said that whilst a lie spreads around the world in a moment truth is still getting a boots on.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 So hopefully in the not too distant future there'll be printing the same kind of things as you're saying about the estrogens

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 in the environment and what we need to do to protect ourselves from it.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 Another subject around estrogens, the association of heart failure and cardiac death.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 What have you found from estrogens effects on those subjects?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Despite all of the 40 years at least of propaganda trying to sell estrogen to men to prevent heart attacks for example,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 they found that they died faster when they took estrogen.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 But they keep coming back trying to sell estrogen as a heart protective hormone.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 And the Women's Health Initiative somewhat set that back by showing that the use of estrogen replacement therapy for menopause

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 increased the number of heart attacks as well as cancer and dementia.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 But despite that they're still hoping to bring back their sales to the 2002 level where they dropped off so sharply.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 Just in the last day or two an article appeared from Yale Medical School doing what they call a meta analysis,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 meaning picking out some articles from junky medical magazines and analyzing them for the type of results basically they want.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Until the Women's Health Initiative, the medical journals for 20 or 30 years were just swamped with the heart protective benefits

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 and the brain anti-Alzheimer's effect and even the anti-cancer effects of estrogen.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 And despite the Women's Health Initiative, these people are now looking back at their journals

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 and drawing out of them the kind of information they want.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 And this study so-called published by the Yale people claims that tens of thousands of women are dying unnecessarily by refusing to take their estrogen treatment for menopause.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Oh my goodness. When exactly the opposite is true, they probably have a greater chance of living without it, huh?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Yeah, and hearing it come from Yale, it reminds me of about 40 years ago there was a daytime television program in which Barbara Seaman debated Yale professor of medicine.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 I suspect it's the same one that sponsored this recent study and she made him look like a complete ignoramus because she knew the facts and he was just quoting the medical doctrine.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 I suspect that Yale is now having its revenge because Barbara Seaman is dead.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 Okay, let me just remind people who they're listening to here.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 Our guest speaker is Dr. Raymond Peat and the number is 923-3911 or if you live outside the area, 1-800-KMUD-RAD and the lines will be open from 7.30 to 8 o'clock.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Okay, so Dr. Peat again, we'll just carry on a little bit more with the subject of estrogen because I know that you mentioned that varicose veins were a fairly important outward sign or a visible sign of the lowered ratio of progesterone being the good hormone, the healthy anti-inflammatory hormone.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 So it's a sign of lowered progesterone to estrogen.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 What have you to say about that?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 Although estrogen is a cell excitant, the process of stimulating one kind of cell activity tends to make it retain water.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 The individual cell stays excited too long and in the process of being excited, the cell emits water and it has to relax a certain length of time to expel the water.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 So under the influence of too much unopposed estrogen, cells tend to get more and more waterlogged and even though they're excited, they progressively lose the ability to contract fully because in contracting, the protein mechanism has to be interacting with itself rather than pushing against the host.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 So it's like pushing against a swollen amount of water.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 And that means that in a muscle such as the wall of a vein under the influence of high estrogen and low progesterone, testosterone and so on, the wall of the vein becomes waterlogged and can't contract periodically to maintain its tone.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 And the same thing happens in nerves, heart muscle, everywhere in the body that estrogen is able to have its influence.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 And in these estrogen-dominated cells, the ability to contract becomes progressively weaker.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Dr. St. Georgi demonstrated the effect of estrogen and progesterone on heart muscle over 50 years ago and showed that under the influence of progesterone, if you stimulate the heart at an increasing frequency, each stroke becomes stronger.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 So it's an efficient way to respond to frequent stimulation.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 It relaxes in between, gathers its equipment together and then has a bigger contraction under the influence of progesterone. But if it's influenced or dominated by estrogen, it's unable to accumulate that information that the stimulation is increasing in frequency.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 So the estrogenized heart will respond to the fast stimulation by just more of the same weak little contractions.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 That's basically how a failing heart behaves.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 That's a typical picture of a gradually aging, failing heart. The excitatory stage is too long. It's not allowed to relax or repolarize and remove the water. It just gradually gets weaker and more feeble.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 You have faded into the buzz again.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 I'll try and stay as close to this microphone as I can without sucking it.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 You mentioned in your response to that last question that progesterone and testosterone, these are two compounds that will oppose the action of estrogen and presumably then they would be useful for people that had not just women perhaps, but people that had estrogen dominant type pathologies or conditions.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 It's now being recognized that testosterone has an anti-cancer value as well just recently.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 Another study came out showing that a testosterone deficiency is a strong predisposer to prostate cancer.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 Let's talk about testosterone a little bit then as that's a fairly pertinent topic.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 I know that when we've talked in the past about the best way to go about exercising, you've always mentioned non-stressful exercise. You don't advocate the aerobic type gymnasium workout where you get your heart rate up to 160 and you're breathing rapidly.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 That's not what you want. You want weight-bearing exercise that doesn't make you breathless.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 I know you've said in the past that that kind of exercise increases your ability to produce muscle and it's the muscle that's so important in basically helping you to maintain a good stable weight.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 But that muscle also through the action of thyroid enables your body to metabolize things more efficiently because it's way more of a useful substance in your body than the fat of an unhealthy or unexercised person.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 The muscle also metabolizes the steroid hormones and with exercise it can actually secrete testosterone.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 But in a resting, idle or stressed muscle without adequate stimulation from good food and thyroid, muscles produce a lot of estrogen.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 In one study, they were using the blood draining from a monkey's arm as a control comparison for the blood coming out of the ovary.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 They found that the monkey's arm was producing as much estrogen as its ovary and that probably isn't a good representative of the average person because the monkey was anesthetized and so on under the influence of stress and chemicals.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 But basically any stressed tissue is going to tend to produce estrogen.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 But a well exercised strong muscle begins producing testosterone and stops producing estrogen.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 So muscles in their own right can secrete testosterone?

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 Yes.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 I was always under the impression that in the male, the main site of testosterone production would be the testes.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 But is there anywhere else in the body that testosterone can be secreted from?

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 I think the skin is known to produce testosterone among other steroid hormones.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 It might be the body's biggest endocrine synthetic factory.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 We often forget about the skin being the largest organ of the body but it's true enough.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 I have another question for you and again it's kind of related to cholesterol.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 I know that you've mentioned a previous study that positively associated an improved outcome from heart failure in relation to an increased cholesterol level.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 Dr. Peat, did you hear that Dr. Peat?

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Not exactly.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 Let me say that again. An increased cholesterol is associated positively with an improved outcome from heart failure.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 Yes. That pretty much can be generalized to other muscles.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 Everyone is hearing the bad news about the anti-cholesterol drugs that cause muscle breakdown.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 Sometimes the muscle breaks down so completely that the proteins leaking from the broken down muscle poison the kidneys and can even kill the person.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 But that's because cholesterol is a stabilizing factor for the skeletal muscles and if you stop cholesterol synthesis,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 the muscles are very susceptible to damage and those same processes are known to occur simultaneously in the heart muscle.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 The leakage of those proteins that can damage the kidneys, they always assume it is coming from the skeletal muscles

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 but the heart under those chemicals is known to leak the same proteins.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Okay. Interesting.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 Okay. I think I've got one or two more questions and then we'll get into the current interest that you have in looking at the similarities

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 or the links between cancers and tissue states, the wetness especially with eye disease.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 So that'll be a new and interesting look at the approach to treatment for age-related macular degeneration for instance.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 I just had another couple of questions related to cancer.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 I know you've had in your previous newsletter you've mentioned the link between hypoxia which is a kind of oxygen deficit and cancer.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 Yeah. The thing that's in the research a lot lately is the hypoxia inducible factor which is a protein that shows up.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 At first they were seeing it wherever they cut off the oxygen supply but that same protein can really be induced by cutting off the glucose supply too.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 So it really should be called the energy deprivation protein.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 They call it by its name, its initials HIF hypoxia inducible factor.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 It's not so much related to oxygen deprivation as sugar deprivation.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 Yeah. Energy deprivation.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 Okay.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 And that has been studied primarily in relation to cancer and finding ways to block that protein production

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 and it turns out that just getting enough glucose and oxygen delivered to the tissue is a very simple way to inhibit that protein.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 So tell me this.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 In all of the bad processes, steam oxygenase with carbon monoxide production, nitric oxide synthase, lactic acid production, prostaglandin production causing inflammation, activating aromatase and so on,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 then lactic acid in turn activates the HIF hypoxia factor.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 So once it gets started, the inflammation tends to promote more inflammation and hypoxia.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 Now forgive me for being thoughtless perhaps but hypoxia as a state of low oxygen

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 and being a negative thing which is what we always normally would associate a low oxygen status with being dangerous and life-threatening,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 I know you've always promoted a CO2, a carbon dioxide rich environment as being a beneficial cellular matrix as it were to have a higher carbon dioxide content.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 So what would necessarily, I mean I know you've mentioned that the hypoxia inducible factor you've just talked about is probably more accurately termed a glucose lack.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 But is there anything negative about hypoxia?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 If you think of the hypoxia as turning on lactic acid which then turns on all of these other inflammatory signals,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 then you see that carbon dioxide turns off the production of lactic acid.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 Simply the ability to turn off lactic acid production is one of the basic protective features of carbon dioxide.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 Okay, good. It's the association then between lactic acid and carbon dioxide that's the important thing.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Okay, all right, you're listening to Ask Your Ab Doctor on KMUD Galbraithville 91.1 FM and from now until 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's subject of the heart, hormones and cancer and the eyes.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 Okay, the number if you live in the area is 923 3911 or if you're outside the area the 1800 number is 1800 KMUD Rad and our special guest speaker is Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 Okay, so I think we'll probably get into the next subject of which I think you're probably going to be writing a newsletter at some point here maybe but as yet you haven't.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 So I know when we've spoken you've mentioned that your research is showing that wetness as opposed to dryness,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 the wetness in the eye associated with cataracts is the same kind of wetness that's found in tumors.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 It's found in the heart during heart failure and also in the brain during brain disease.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 Yeah, despite the fact that the failing heart becomes hardened even calcified and tumors are stiffer than healthy tissue and even with age in a very serious dementia the brain can become sort of rubbery with so many connective tissue cells.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 So despite the fact that the tissue is becoming firmer these thick degenerative states actually contain more water so that if you dry a piece of the organ it loses much more weight than a healthy organ would.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 In relation to the given amount of nucleic acid and proteins and so on these degenerative tissues have a very high percentage of water but besides the actual percentage of water,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 the water changes state and becomes relatively more like free bulk water. It can be frozen where the healthy cell is functioning somewhat as an antifreeze binding the water so that it isn't as free to move out of the cell or to be frozen

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 or otherwise subject to influence.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Do you think we do actually have a couple of corners on the line but do you just quickly to rephrase what you said are you saying that the water found in these tissues during these type of pathologies is not electrically the same as regular water?

00:33:44.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 Well if you freeze say you have a lens that has cataracts in it and has a much higher percentage of water per protein molecule and if you freeze that it will crystallize easier than a healthy lens and this can be studied in an MRI machine

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 because you can very clearly see the difference between the water that's bound firmly to the cell in the way it should be or the water that's just sitting there as excess useless water plugging up the cell function.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Interesting. Alright well let's not keep these corners we've got I think we've got three corners on the line now so let's take the first corner. You're on the air? Hello you're on the air.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 Okay a corner was on the air so it's not there anymore. Okay for some reason. Okay so.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 We had another person that didn't want to wait but she wanted to know if black cohosh was effective for menopause.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 Okay so bit of a convoluted question because black cohosh is typically used in the literature for menopause decreasing night sweats but I think there is also a lot of research coming out of Europe which actually prevents the use of black cohosh as a kind of more of a kind of estrogen stimulant.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 So I've always kind of viewed black cohosh with a little bit of caution. It's not something that I would say straight away would be useful but there are other ways to lower your estrogen state because the whole point of the black cohosh was that it was more of an estrogen replacement.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 I've heard some ideas that it was an anti prolactin factor. I don't know what the current state of that idea is. Yeah I'm not too sure about that either Dr. Peat. And what did you say Sue?

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 She wanted to know what the best herb would be for menopause or herbs.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 Well really it's probably as much about your excess estrogen as anything else. I know Dr. Peat in terms of menopause you would probably suggest that excess estrogen is one of the main causes and to bring that down into line with the anti-estrogen hormone pregnenolone or progesterone would probably be the most efficient way of doing it.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 And usually thyroid. Right. Because the cholesterol tends to rise at menopause and if thyroid is adequate that will keep turning the cholesterol into more of the pregnenolone and progesterone to protect against estrogen.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 Good. Okay so there's another caller on the line. So let's take this next caller. You're on the air.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 Is this for me? Yeah you're on the air.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 Hello this is David. You know and I know this is kind of a deep subject and I've heard you ask questions before about water Andrew and I've read different things that Dr. Peat has written about like poly water and different types of more structured water.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 And I'm just curious you asked the question just a minute ago and I don't know if I understood the answer but when we have these tissues that are experiencing edema and we have you know what we're calling H2O is that water considered to not be structured at its optimum?

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 And in line with that kind of a similar question is it seems like I've heard that I think I've heard this from Dr. Peat in these different discussions that do we produce our own water at times and is that a more structured water?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 And then the other question is like when we drink orange juice or we drink milk and say we're drinking raw milk versus pasteurized milk is the water content within those foods is that considered a very optimum structured water?

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 Okay Dr. Peat did you hear those questions clearly or?

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 Yes, my article on the poly water question talks about some of the ranges of influence how far a certain surface can influence a structure such as in clay.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 The water in ordinary clay is structured differently from bulk water but there's also a question of how long the influence of that surface can last.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 Gerald Pollack at the University of Washington has there are some videos on the internet that you can see his demonstrations of some of the odd behavior of water even in a fairly bulk situation.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 But ordinarily it doesn't make any difference whether you drink water that has been boiled recently or frozen recently.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 It's mostly a matter of degassing that makes it behave differently according to its recent history.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 It's safe to drink tea or coffee water that's been boiled but what matters is the state of the water inside the cell and that's governed by the energy of the metabolism and the ratio of things like carbon dioxide to lactic acid.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 In the lens the proteins in other hard tissues collagen is the main protein that gives it stiffness but in the lens the main protein is called crystalline and it happens that crystalline is very well ordered with reference both to the structure of water

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 and to the wavelength of visible light so that the water surrounding these proteins in the lens is so well ordered that it doesn't interfere with or reflect or absorb the light passing through it.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 So it's an essential protein for maintaining the transparency of the lens and this protein if you compare it to collagen or albumin or other common proteins the protein can bind very firmly much more water about twice as much water as other proteins and hold it under its influence.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 So really the water of the lens and the protein is in a tight system in a normal state but when the energy processes fail and you absorb influences such as estrogen, polyunsaturated fats, lactic acid, various toxins,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 then the energy is unable to repair the system and the water gets out of control of these proteins and starts becoming ordinary bulk water that interferes with the passage of light and lets junk accumulate such as broken down fragments of polyunsaturated fats.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 Acrolein for example breaking down from the N-3 proteins is a major factor in cataract formation.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 Okay, I want to make sure that fairly quickly because we do have a couple more callers but that last caller also asked if we produce our own water and is the water in milk and OJ an optimum type of water?

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 The water that has been filtered through an orange tree or a cow is at least very purified compared to the water that you get out of the plumbing.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 I know you're not very keen on water just per se drinking water you'd much rather people drink something that has nutritional value.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 Yes, and we do make quite a bit of water metabolically when we eat carbohydrates in particular.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 Some of the oxygen that we are using to produce energy, some of that becomes water and the metabolic water is just intermixing with the water that we get from the food itself.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 But the nature of the oxygen contained in carbohydrates can influence the metabolism of the cell.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 The hydrogens as well as the oxygen are a mixture of isotopes of different weight in everything that we eat or consist of.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 We have a mixture of these different weight isotopes and heavy water, deuterium oxide, slows down our metabolism so there's a slight difference in the water that we get from tropical sugar versus beet sugar that's grown up in a high altitude.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 Because the rainfall is separating the heavy water from the light water.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 Interesting.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 So there is a slight difference in the quality of the water depending on where the fruit grows.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Yeah, far out.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 Andrew, and I know I'm going to say this real quick, I'm sorry, but I just want to make sure I understand one thing.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 So in a way, the water, like you were talking about in the lens of the eye, it's structured so that it's almost like crystalline and that it actually structures the different materials that it's intermingling with?

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 Well, the protein structures the water and then the water emits things selectively.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 Okay.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 Okay, well, hey, thank you for that.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 That's really interesting.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 Thank you very much.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 All right, thank you for your call.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 Okay, we have two more callers, so let's take the next caller.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 You're on the air?

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 Hello.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 Hi, and where are you from?

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 What's that?

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 Where are you calling from?

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 Oh, hey, I'm calling from just Laytonville down here.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 Okay.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 And I'll be real quick.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 I know you got another call and a great show, very, very interesting here.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 Thank you.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 I hate to backtrack here, but I take about 100 milligrams of metropolol.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 Okay.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 You know, it's a cholesterol thing.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 I've been taking it every day for like five years.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 I also take isosorbide.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 It's a time-released nitroglycerin, you know, for my heart.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 Right, you have angina.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 I've had like seven heart attacks in the last nine years.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 I'll take my answer off the air, but with this much metropolol, is this something I should be concerned about?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 Should I, you know, like talk to my doc about it?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 Okay, Dr. Peat, what do you think about that?

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 I don't know that drug.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 Do you know what class it is?

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 I don't either.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 One moment.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 I don't know if the call is still there or not.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 Hello?

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 Hi.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 Did you hear Dr. Peat?

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 He was asking if you knew what kind of, what class of drug metropolol was in.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 I take it for my cholesterol.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 That's all I know.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 Right.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 Yeah.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 I'm not too sure.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 The only safe way I know to lower cholesterol chronically is by increasing thyroid function.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 In 1936 or 7, people demonstrated that if you remove a person's thyroid gland, their cholesterol level goes up as a mirror image of their oxygen consumption going down.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 And when you give them a thyroid supplement, the cholesterol will fall as the oxygen consumption increases.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 That's a very simple mechanism that doctors prefer to prescribe drugs with the toxic side effects.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 And just lowering the cholesterol, even if the drug didn't have other side effects, the cholesterol is normally destined to turn into DHEA, progesterone, testosterone, and so on.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 So if you push down the availability of cholesterol by any mechanism, you're going to tend to deprive the body of those steroids that it should be forming.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 You guys are great, man.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 Thanks for all the information.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 You're welcome.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 Good night.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 Good night.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 Okay.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 So were there any more callers on the air, Sue?

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 Yeah, one more.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 Okay.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 So let's take this next caller.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 Oh, okay, they've gone.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 Okay, they've hung up.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 Okay, well, the number here, if you live in the area, is 923-3911.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 Or if you live outside the area, the number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
 And the lines are open to 8 o'clock.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 So guest speaker, Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 We're covering his latest work on the similarities between the component or structural components of cataracts, the conditions like macular degeneration, tumors, and heart failure in terms of the heart muscle.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 So I just wanted to ask you this next -- oh, who's there?

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 We had two very shy callers that didn't want to go on the air.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000
 Okay.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 One question is regarding the thyroid supplements, does it matter if it's T or T3?

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 That's one question.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 And then I'll ask the other one.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 Okay.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000
 All right.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 Well, there's two.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 There's T4 and T3.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 So it would very much matter, depending on what their situation was, which one they may or may not be short of.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 So Dr. Peat, how would you best answer this?

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 Because this is your subject.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 Well, if the study that led to the substitution of thyroxine or T4 or the natural combination T3 and T4 was a test on male medical students, average age in the early 20s --

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 Okay.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 -- and being male, they didn't have the problems that typically females have about five or ten times the incidence of thyroid problems.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 So they tested thyroxine on a population that was extremely inappropriate for testing a thyroid product, and they said it works just like natural thyroid.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 And since it was a commercial proprietary material, they preferred it to the natural product.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 But after about 10 or 15 years, the actual active hormone, T3, was identified and studied, and it was found that this is what women lack, typically causing them to have five or ten times the thyroid problems that men do,

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 because estrogen interferes with the glands' secretions of both T4 and T3, but it especially interferes with the liver's ability to convert thyroxine to the active hormone T3.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 So many women actually get worse symptoms when they take thyroxine because it suppresses the little bit of T3 that their thyroid gland is producing, yet doesn't add to the amount of T3 that should be produced by the liver.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 Okay, excellent. And is there another reason why the excess estrogen found in postmenopausal women or even menstruating women works against them, works against their thyroid?

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 I didn't hear that.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 Okay. I just said that that's the main reason why menstruating or postmenopausal women are at more risk in terms of low thyroid function.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 Yeah, and some of the typically female problems, such as endometriosis, are just amazingly responsive to the proper thyroid supplementation, because once the thyroid goes down, then estrogen goes up, and since the estrogen blocks thyroid action, it becomes a vicious circle.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 Yeah, got it. Okay, well, there is another caller on the air, so let's see if...

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 Well, no, it's the caller who didn't want to go on the air, but they wanted to know what the effects of cannabinoids are on cancer.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 Dr. Peat.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 Well, on cancer, I think people are still exploring that. There are some suspicions that it might actually slow cancer growth. Others worry that it might make it worse, but mostly it's used to prevent the stress symptoms, and for that, it's effective.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 So, what do you... just talking about that a little bit more in terms of, as much as anything else, helping me understand more about it, because, again, I think I'm probably on the fence in terms of not knowing enough one way or the other, but in terms of the plant and its relationship to hops, both in the cannabaceae, hops express a lot of pro-estrogenic compounds,

00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 which is why the hop pickers during hop picking in August in England would lose their periods, such was its powerful effects on the hormone system. Do you look at those compounds as being pro-estrogenic, and if you do...

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 Oh, definitely. Hops is a very powerful estrogen.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 Right. Is there any similarity, given that the plant's in the same family?

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 I'm sure there's a lot of overlap. Almost every plant has some estrogenic or anti-estrogenic material, but mostly they're estrogenic because it's a defensive material that, for example, acts like birth control pills for predators.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:56.000
 The known effects of heavy marijuana smoking are definitely estrogenic, but some of that could just be that any kind of smoke is estrogenic.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 Right. Is there any parallel? I know carbon monoxide is present in abundant quantities when you smoke. Is there any way... and I've seen blood work from clients who are smokers. They always seem to have a pretty high CO2, which you would say is a good thing.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 Is there a beneficial... I'm not saying smoking is good and we should all start smoking, but is there anything more simplistic or is there something more dangerous at work than just getting a little bit of extra CO2 in your system?

00:54:35.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 Well, the carbon monoxide can accumulate and have some chronic harmful effects, such as on the liver function, but I think the real danger of smoke is the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are inflammatory and estrogenic and carcinogenic.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 Anything you burn is going to produce some of those and then any smoke of a plant material is going to produce some dioxin-type material.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 Right. Okay. I certainly do have more I want to ask you about in terms of your work looking at tissues and wetness and tumors, but for fear of running over the show, I don't want to ask any more callers on the air.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 Yeah, I think we do have a couple waiting, but I think we're going to carry this one on next month. I think there's enough interest in it certainly to bring out more callers.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:53.000
 So, Dr. Peat, I think it'll give me an opportunity to let people know more about you and I'll thank you very much for joining us.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 Okay. Hope you've got a better line.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 I do too. I'm sorry for the listeners who've perhaps found a little difficulty in hearing Dr. Peat and I'm sorry, Dr. Peat, that you've had difficulty hearing as well.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:20.000
 Okay. So, just to wrap up the show, the next few minutes that we have, Dr. Raymond Peat has a website and his address is www.raypeat.com.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 There's something in excess of 50 or more scientific journal articles that are fully referenced scientifically.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 So, it's not just hearsay. He's been, why do you call it, he's been crying out loud from a distance for quite some time now.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 I'm glad that people are hearing what he has to say and I'm glad that he's being vindicated by current scientific literature being in accord with what he's been mentioning for 20 or 30 more years.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:58.000
 So, his website there, www.raypeat.com, is an excellent source of information. I would encourage you very much to go check it out.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.000
 For those people that have tuned in to this show, thanks so much for calling.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 It's always very helpful that you call in and that we know that the people out there that are listening and want to know more.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:23.000
 I think it's always good to have that kind of doubtful mind that wants to seek out more information and not just be fed what it is that comes through the TV and from adverts and commercial newspapers, etc.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 So, our toll free number is 1-888-WBM-ERB. Sarah or I can be reached Monday through Friday or maybe Sarah can't at this point in time, folks.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 I guess she has a baby. I've got to start thinking that she's right there right now.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 But, okay, I can be reached Monday through Friday, 9 to 5, consultations or whatever at the end of the show.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 If you have other questions relating to this month's show, that would be fine, too.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 Okay, so thanks so much for joining us and for those people that have ears, let them hear.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 [Music]

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 Okay, I want to give folks just a real quick look at the weather along the coast.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:24.000
 The next few days are going to be patchy fog, lows in the high 50s and highs in the low 60s, so around the 60 degree mark.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:37.000
 And then inland in Redway, it's calling for high on Saturday tomorrow of 96 going up to 99 on Sunday, so hot inland on the weekend.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:48.000
