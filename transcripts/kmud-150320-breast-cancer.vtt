00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.040
 Well, a very good evening to you all.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.040
 This is Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Galbraithville 91.1 FM.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.040
 From 7.30 till the end of the show, 8 o'clock callers,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.040
 as usual, are invited to call in with any questions.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.040
 I would like to try and iterate that.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.040
 I would really appreciate those people that are listening this evening to the show

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.040
 that have questions around the subject of the show.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.040
 I'd really appreciate that.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.040
 Just keep Dr. Peat's attention focused firmly on the subject

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.040
 and to keep the listeners informed as much as possible about this month's subject,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.040
 which is going to be about breast cancer.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.040
 In the last couple of months, I've been approached by quite a few people,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.040
 actually a startling number of people,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.040
 that have either known someone who's going through breast cancer treatment.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.040
 I've met people that have been dying of breast cancer,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.040
 and it's just prompted me to bring this subject up again.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.040
 I believe we have spoken about it in the past,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.040
 but this month's show will be about breast cancer awareness and prevention.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.040
 I don't think we want to necessarily dwell on the treatment,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.040
 although we will mention those alternative medical treatments that are available

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.040
 and are showing pretty good promise for inhibiting estrogen, for example,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.040
 with the aromatase inhibitors.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.040
 But the prevention of it, I think, is the fundamental key to good health,

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.040
 and so we put people's diets and lifestyles in the right place to begin with.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.040
 That preventive strategy is probably a better payoff.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:41.040
 Okay, so you're listening to RQF Dr. KMud91.1 FM.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.040
 We're very pleased to welcome Dr. Peat to the show this evening

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.040
 and have his expertise with us.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.040
 If you live in the area, the 923 numbers, 923 3911,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.040
 or if you're outside the area, as a lot of people who call in do seem to be outside the area,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.040
 there's a toll-free number, which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.040
 or you can alternatively just go ahead and use the 707 area code,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.040
 so that would be 707-923-3911.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.040
 So just a very brief introduction for myself.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.040
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.040
 I graduated in England with a master's degree in herbal medicine.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.040
 I came to California with my wife, Sarah,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.040
 who I'm very pleased to have on the show again this evening.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.040
 Sarah?

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.040
 Good evening. My name is Sarah Johanneson-Murray,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.040
 and I'm delighted to be on the show talking about ways to help prevent breast cancer.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.040
 Okay, so we run a clinic in Garboville where we see patients with a wide range of conditions,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.040
 treat them with herbal medicine and dietary advice,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.040
 as well as consult with people nationwide.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.040
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, are you on the other line?

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.040
 Yes, here I am.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.040
 Great. Well, thanks so much for joining us on the show.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.040
 As always, I want to make sure people get an introduction from you

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.040
 about your academic and professional background before we get into tonight's subject.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.040
 Okay. I'm a biologist, a Ph.D. from the University of Oregon,

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.040
 specializing in physiology,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.040
 especially related to aging and reproductive hormone issues.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.040
 Okay, excellent.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.040
 So for tonight, if not as always, it's a special specialty that you have,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:21.040
 given that reproductive hormones are surrounding the picture of tonight's topic on breast cancer.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.040
 So looking at some articles that I was reading earlier on today,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.040
 I think most people will recognize breast cancer awareness

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.040
 and the numbers of people that die from breast cancer as being fairly staggering.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:43.040
 And I saw an article that was saying it was the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.040
 What's your opinion of the causes of breast cancer in the first place,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.040
 and how does this differ from the medical interpretation?

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:59.040
 The animal studies have been pretty clear for almost 100 years

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:06.040
 that it is a matter of an estrogen-like irritation,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:12.040
 if not exactly estrogen in the narrowest sense.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:19.040
 But the main carcinogenic substances, such as in smoke and tar,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:25.040
 are estrogen-like in their structure and effect.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:35.040
 So the breast is very sensitive to an imbalance of estrogen-like stimulation.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:41.040
 So it's susceptible to anything that has an estrogen-like effect,

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.040
 including smoke and pollutants of various sorts.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:52.040
 Is this down to the fact that the estrogen receptors are most concentrated in the breast tissue

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.040
 or some other reason?

00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.040
 Well, every cell has estrogen receptors,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:06.040
 but the way they interact with other functions, I think,

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.040
 is more important than the number of receptors,

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:17.040
 because once you're exposed to estrogen, a cell will produce more and more receptors.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:26.040
 And progesterone has a very central function of destroying estrogen receptors.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:33.040
 So a breast that's well-balanced and exposed to enough progesterone

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:39.040
 won't have very many estrogen receptors, the progesterone dominance.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.040
 Interesting. So you said that the actual exposure to estrogen

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:47.040
 will cause an upregulation in the expression of estrogen receptors?

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:54.040
 Yeah, pretty much in any cell. And irritation in general will do that.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:10:03.040
 A failure of energy combined with stimulation will make estrogen receptors start to appear.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:15.040
 So that old people, as the energy production decreases, any irritation tends to induce

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:23.040
 estrogen production as well as sensitivity by the receptors.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:30.040
 So interestingly, you're talking about the causal link, if you like,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.040
 or the link between estrogen and irritation and stresses.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.040
 And I think later on, I just want to bring up some more questions

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.040
 surrounding HRT and that kind of thing and estrogen replacement therapy.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.040
 And I know when we've talked about many different subjects,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:53.040
 you do bring up estrogen as being a causative factor in a lot of inflammation and irritation

00:10:53.040 --> 00:11:01.040
 and saying at this point in time that estrogen can be directly responsible for cancers.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:14.040
 Yeah, the animal studies in the '30s and '40s were very clear that it isn't just the normally responsive tissues

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:21.040
 like the uterus and the breast that will cancerize under the influence of estrogen and similar things,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.040
 but those are just the most sensitive.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:35.040
 And with increased uninterrupted exposure to estrogen,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:43.040
 the sequence tends to go first cancer of the uterus, then cancer of the breast,

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:50.040
 then of the lungs, kidneys, intestine and liver and brain.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.040
 Are you talking about primaries now or metastases?

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.040
 No, primaries.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.040
 Right, okay.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:06.040
 Any tissue that is de-energized and irritated will develop not only the ability to respond to estrogen,

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.040
 but actual ability to make estrogen.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:17.040
 So your fat or your skin or your liver can become a source of estrogen

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.040
 in proportion to how much stress you're under, even if you don't have ovaries.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.040
 I was going to cover the subject.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.040
 I'll try and remember the subject.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.040
 I wanted to ask a question about fat and conversion to estrogen.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.040
 So it's not just our monthly cycling that's exposing women to estrogen.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.040
 Estrogen is so prominent in foods and in our environment,

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:46.040
 increasingly so with our degradation of the environment.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:56.040
 Yeah, the irritation, the fat is particularly sensitive to it.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:03.040
 It isn't very well supplied with defensive and energetic systems.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:13.040
 So it seems to be a major age-related source of estrogen, especially if you're overweight.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.040
 Interesting.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.040
 Okay, so I think that's a subject that should be brought out a little more.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:24.040
 So fats in their own right, and at this point in time, are we talking polyunsaturated fats or fats in general?

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:29.040
 That was just your normal, ordinary fat cells,

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:38.040
 but since the polyunsaturated fats increase the deposition and storage of fat,

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:46.040
 and since they break down to form the inflammation-promoting prostaglandins,

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:55.040
 they make the fat cells more likely to produce excess estrogen.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:04.040
 Do you think there's any strategy to be benefited by the --

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:11.040
 because I know you mentioned too about increasing the dominance in the body of saturated to unsaturated fat

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:19.040
 by avoiding polyunsaturates, and ultimately over three or four years,

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:24.040
 you say that essentially the body fat composition could be turned back to a more saturated type of fat

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.040
 if you avoid the polys and --

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:37.040
 Yeah, there's a thing called the saturation index, which is just the ratio between a saturated fat like stearic acid

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.040
 and a polyunsaturated such as linoleic acid,

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:51.040
 and people with cancer have a higher polyunsaturation, lower saturation index.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.040
 But you're saying a saturated fat cell is still capable of producing estrogen?

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:04.040
 Yeah, the cell which is more saturated is stabler and less likely to produce estrogen,

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:14.040
 but the more highly polyunsaturated fats are very closely connected with estrogen

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:23.040
 so that the amount in the tissue and in circulation of, say, a five or six unsaturated fats,

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:30.040
 such as you find in fish oil, you produce with aging.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:37.040
 These are closely associated with the level of estrogen stimulation.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.040
 So eating nuts and seeds that are high in those polyunsaturated fats

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.040
 and fried foods that are fried in those corn and canola oil

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:52.040
 is going to be more promoting an estrogenic fat and --

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.040
 Yeah, for 80 or 90 years, about every 10 or 15 years,

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:03.040
 someone has done a study showing that the more polyunsaturated fat in the diet,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.040
 the higher the cancer incidence,

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:18.040
 all the way down to extremely rare cancer incidence when there's no polyunsaturated fat in the diet.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:23.040
 Well, good. I was really just hoping that this show would just highlight again the importance

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:29.040
 of what you've been mentioning for many years now about improving your saturated fat intake

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:34.040
 and being very aware of the sources of polyunsaturated both in pre-made foods

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:39.040
 as well as foods that you may choose to be cooking with

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:47.040
 and that the ramifications have a pretty wide cause and effect associated with them

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:56.040
 and cancer obviously is one of those effects of decreasing energy to promote suitable responses

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.040
 and that because it's thyroid suppressing effects,

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:04.040
 that is a direct relationship between low energy and the ability for systems

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:12.040
 to lose their correct structure and organization in terms of doing the right thing.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:23.040
 One of the diet factors that shows up repeatedly in association with a low rate of cancer is a high fruit intake

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:32.040
 and fruit eaters getting the carbohydrate and the sugar produce saturated fats of their own

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:37.040
 so they keep a relatively high saturation index in their tissues.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.040
 Excellent. Okay, good.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.040
 Well, you're listening to Ask Your Herb, Dr. Kami Deegal with All 91.1 FM.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.040
 This evening's topic is breast cancer.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.040
 If we do get any callers here between 7, 13, 8,

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.040
 it would be good if we can try and stay on the topic that we're discussing.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:18:02.040
 Dr. Peat, HRT has always mystified me how HRT has carried on for such a long time.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.040
 I know they're just talking about it recently that it's maybe not the best thing for women.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:13.040
 Now they're finally saying that like they are admitting that saturated fats are actually better for you than their polys.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.040
 But HRT is a concept.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:23.040
 How do you think it came to a position where estrogen was such a promoted,

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:32.040
 supposedly beneficial for your bones to help with things like age-related dementia, memory loss?

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:37.040
 And it's actually the opposite. You have plenty of evidence to show that it's completely opposite to that.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.040
 It's actually not good for your bones and it actually increases the chances of dementia.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.040
 There is a very good essay on the internet.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.040
 I think it's still available, a Harvard Law School paper by Carla Rothenberg

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:54.040
 on the history of hormone replacement therapy.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.040
 Carla Rothenberg?

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.040
 Rothen, R-O-T-H-E-N-B-E-R-G.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.040
 B-L-G, okay. Carla Rothenberg, okay.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:13.040
 And it gives the political economic history of how the 12 big estrogen companies in 1942 got together

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:23.040
 to basically take over the FDA, medical journals, and universities to indoctrinate the idea that

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:32.040
 estrogen was the female hormone that would promote fertility and all the good female virtues,

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:38.040
 even though it went absolutely against the research of the 1930s,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:48.040
 which showed that progesterone was the essential female hormone that promoted fertility and good pregnancy success.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:54.040
 I mean, they knew back in the 1800s that the chimney sweeps would die of testicular cancer

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.040
 from the estrogenic effects of the soot.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:02.040
 Yeah, but this was all turned around by these 12 giant companies getting together

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:08.040
 to promote the idea of the estrogen as the beneficial female hormone.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:17.040
 And so they came on the market with the idea that, I think it was a Harvard husband and wife,

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:25.040
 a pair of doctors that promoted the idea that you should give pregnant women estrogen to prevent miscarriage,

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:32.040
 and that produced the generation of DES babies, two generations actually.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.040
 Their daughters also were susceptible to cancer.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:46.040
 And after the news got out by the late '50s that estrogen was not good for preventing miscarriage,

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:51.040
 they came out with the contraception idea.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:57.040
 They knew in the '30s that estrogen causes miscarriages and abortion,

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:03.040
 and so they sold it for the opposite as long as they could get away with it,

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:12.040
 then came on the market to sell it to prevent or interrupt pregnancies.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:18.040
 So a lot of contraceptive pills allow pregnancy or fertilization to occur,

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.040
 but it inhibits implantation; is that correct?

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:29.040
 Yeah. My thesis advisor, Arnold Soderwall, did some very clear research on that,

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:40.040
 showing that a small amount at the time of or just before implantation would prevent implantation,

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:47.040
 but a slightly larger amount after implantation had occurred would cause it to be ejected.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:54.040
 And he made a graph showing that at each stage of pregnancy,

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:59.040
 just slightly increasing the dose of estrogen would cause miscarriage,

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:05.040
 all the way from preventing implantation to aborting it at any stage.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:12.040
 It would cause the embryo to die and simply be resorbed.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:21.040
 That's incredible. It's like another worldwide, I don't know, brainwashing, I don't know what it is.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.040
 I think it's so commonly repeated.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:29.040
 These different topics are so commonly repeated by broad stream media,

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:36.040
 and those in, for want of a better word, power, the doctors, for example,

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.040
 who are looked up to and respected by most people that go to see them

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:44.040
 for their education and their prowess, if you like, I don't know.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:50.040
 I just find it so incredible that there's evidence out there to show the opposite.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.040
 In very many cases, it takes such a long time to make an impression,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.040
 for it to get enough groundswell for the tide to get turned on this kind of thing.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.040
 I mean, estrogen has been, ever since I can remember,

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:07.040
 has been the beneficial female hormone and HRT, and my mom was on HRT,

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:15.040
 and I know all these other women on HRT, and it's probably one of the worst things you can do.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:21.040
 Several years ago, someone did a survey of the publications

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:26.040
 just in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:31.040
 In the first years after the industry got this conspiracy together,

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:39.040
 they found that 200 different health conditions had been published in that one journal

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.040
 as treatable or curable or preventable by estrogen.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.040
 All of those 200 turned out to be false.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:55.040
 The quantity and quality of the fraud is just hard to understand.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.040
 - Staggering. Now, didn't-- - Well, it's all marketing, marketing, marketing.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:06.040
 Yeah. Well, what I wanted to ask you is, I think I remember hearing something like,

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:11.040
 the only thing-- well, and I've not heard you say this a moment ago,

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.040
 unless I've got it round the wrong way.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:19.040
 The only beneficial thing that estrogen was used for was really for getting pregnant,

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:25.040
 but you're saying that actually estrogen at this time of just preconception or post-conception

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.040
 would actually abort the fetus?

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:36.040
 Yeah. SodaVol was probably the most concise in this experiment

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:41.040
 in showing that it was exactly a dose relationship.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:50.040
 And you could shift that dose relationship by increasing either the amount of progesterone

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.040
 or vitamin E as antagonists to that.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:25:06.040
 And my dissertation showed that that interaction worked through the availability largely of oxygen.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:12.040
 Estrogen cuts off the availability of oxygen to the embryo,

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:21.040
 making the uterus short-circuit, burn up and affect the oxygen before the embryo gets it.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:29.040
 And progesterone and vitamin E both improve the delivery or preservation of oxygen for the--

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.040
 Could you just repeat the name of the author again?

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.040
 I wouldn't mind taking a look at it if I can find out this information myself.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.040
 What was the name of the author of that?

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.040
 Arnold Soderwald.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.040
 Soderwald. How do you-- S-O-D-E-R?

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.040
 S-O-D-E-R-W-A-L-L.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.040
 And didn't you say A-L-L?

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.040
 Okay. Well, go ahead.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:57.040
 Didn't you say, Dr. Peat, that they didn't promote progesterone for all these 200 different diseases

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:01.040
 because it's so expensive to manufacture and estrogen is so cheap to manufacture

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.040
 and they wanted to make more money off the estrogen?

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:15.040
 More than that, it was that they knew in the '30s someone simply put a glass plate in the smoke of a candle

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:25.040
 and then extracted the soot and found that they had a whole variety of chemical substances,

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:31.040
 soot essences, which were estrogenic as well as carcinogenic.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:41.040
 And so they understood that there was an infinite opportunity for having a patentable specific estrogen

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.040
 that you could market as your own product.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:53.040
 But any time you change the molecule of progesterone, you decrease or destroy its effect.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.040
 And so all those synthetic progestins actually have an estrogenic effect.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:05.040
 Yeah, because progesterone, part of its effect is what it turns into,

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:14.040
 and the additives attached to the progesterone molecule specifically block its conversion

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.040
 into that natural range of other steroids.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:26.040
 And since the brain is a major source and user of progesterone,

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:35.040
 probably the worst effect of the synthetic progestins is that they interfere with brain function.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:43.040
 So here's a hormone that helps breast cancer patients, helps pregnancies,

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:48.040
 and has all these pro-life wonderful effects.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.040
 And they can't patent it because it's a natural hormone,

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:58.040
 so it's not promoted and it's not sold readily available.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:03.040
 Marian Diamond, a professor at the University of California,

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:12.040
 did studies on animals showing that estrogen in pregnancy stops the growth of the brain,

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:16.040
 especially the cortex, makes it thinner and smaller.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.040
 Progesterone increases the growth, especially of the cortex of the brain,

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:28.040
 making it bigger, more intelligent, and less psychopathic.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:34.040
 And Katherine Adalton, working in England with her human patients,

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.040
 found accidentally the same thing turning out,

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:45.040
 that the women who were having pregnancy difficulties before treatment,

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:51.040
 their older kids averaged below 100 IQ.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:57.040
 Once she treated them and prevented their toxemia of pregnancy,

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.040
 the kids averaged over 130 IQ.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.040
 Wow.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:11.040
 And isn't it quite expensive for companies to manufacture pure bioidentical progesterone?

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:16.040
 Well, not compared to what drugs generally cost.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:22.040
 Well, I mean, the raw material, if you compared raw material for estrogen, if it's just soot.

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.040
 Yeah, you can get a thousand doses of estrogen for a dollar

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:31.040
 and only a few doses of progesterone for a dollar.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.040
 So it just all comes down to the dollar, the money.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.040
 I wanted to very quickly bring, I think we have a call on the line,

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.040
 but we'll take that in a moment here.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:45.040
 I just wanted to bring out this thing before we would move on to strategies to help women,

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.040
 especially because men do get breast cancer, but the numbers are fairly low,

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:54.040
 but women especially, to improve their odds of not getting cancer

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:59.040
 by avoiding all those things, Dr. Peat, that you're going to bring out from stress

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.040
 and its related effects with estrogen and everything else,

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.040
 that tamoxifen was a drug that was used to treat breast cancer,

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:15.040
 actually promoted endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events in so many people that it was given to.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.040
 And liver tumors and eye damage.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.040
 Okay.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:23.040
 And you mentioned that it's actually an estrogenic drug itself, very powerful estrogenic drug.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.040
 Just talk about that a little.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:33.040
 It's less powerful than estradiol, so it can protect against the overproduction of estradiol,

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.040
 but in itself it's estrogenic.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.040
 Incredible.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:42.040
 Okay, well let's take this call and see where we're going with this.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.040
 Hello, caller, you're on the air.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.040
 And where are you from?

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.040
 Hi, from Kansas City.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.040
 Hey, you're on the air.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.040
 Go ahead.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:56.040
 In last month's interview on urea, Dr. Peat mentioned up to 120 grams per day,

00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.040
 15 grams at a time for getting rid of excess water.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:06.040
 When you said excess water, what were you referring to exactly?

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:16.040
 That's interesting in relation to estrogen because within about five minutes of an exposure to estrogen,

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:26.040
 cells begin to take up a lot of water, and that excess water stimulates cell division and growth,

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:36.040
 and that's part of the process of promoting cancer growth is to keep them in an excited inflammatory state

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:42.040
 of too much water, which keeps them from differentiating and functioning,

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:46.040
 and that makes them able to keep dividing.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:32:00.040
 And so one of the principles of cancer treatment should be looking at the body's water economy.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:10.040
 One other question on that was, so how long or how often for the 120 grams of urea per day to actually have that benefit?

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:24.040
 A Greek doctor, Deanopoulos, was using urea in various forms, injecting it right into tumors, for example,

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:36.040
 also giving it intravenously, and it can be applied in crystal or solid form to an open superficial tumor.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:48.040
 It's a very strange material because it doesn't destroy tissue even in a pure crystalline concentrated form,

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:59.040
 and the injecting of 50% solution or a concentrated solution is possible if it goes in slowly,

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:08.040
 but people are used to thinking of an osmotic effect from a concentrated crystalline material,

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:16.040
 but urea isn't an osmolite. It has a very strange interaction with water.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:21.040
 It can go into cells freely just like the water,

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:29.040
 so what it's doing to remove excess water from cells isn't osmotically drawing out the water.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:41.040
 It's doing something, adjusting the structure of the cells so that it doesn't have that excited need to retain water.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:56.040
 The typical intravenous dose would use a 30% solution, giving maybe 20 grams at a time,

00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:06.040
 but up to a total of 120 grams per day, which could be either for using it as a diuretic for heart failure

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:18.040
 or for inflammation of the brain when the brain is holding too much water because of a disturbance of the anti-diuretic hormone or vasopressin,

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.040
 or in treating cancer.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:31.040
 So 20 or 30 grams at a time can also be given orally and is well absorbed and circulates systemically,

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:36.040
 so it doesn't have to be intravenous.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:47.040
 If it is used intravenously, it has to be added to a physiological solution of sodium chloride or glucose.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:35:06.040
 A 5% or 10% solution of glucose can have 30% -- not necessarily that amount, but it can have a full load of urea added to it.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:13.040
 So you're saying that you could do 20 to 30 grams a day, which is probably about a couple teaspoons?

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:17.040
 Yeah, that much, up to 120 grams.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.040
 And then you'd want to dissolve it in a little salt water?

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.040
 Or fruit juice.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:29.040
 The people recommending it for treating heart failure, they've had patients staying on it for years

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:35.040
 where the other diuretics were disturbing their mineral metabolism.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:49.040
 They were very stable on using urea, and they recommended using about 20 grams at a time in a glass of fruit juice

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.040
 and doing that several times a day.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.040
 So that's probably like two-thirds of an ounce.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.040
 And urea is a commonly available compound.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.040
 Very cheap.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.040
 Very inexpensive.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:04.040
 And there's been lots of studies showing its benefit.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.040
 Okay, well, thanks for your call, Carla.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:15.040
 Dr. Peat, what I wanted to -- if I could just briefly ask your opinion of the cause of breast cancer,

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:22.040
 then we can look at some of the strategies that people can employ to negate that or prevent it.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:35.040
 The standard opinion is that it's a genetic thing, either inherited or occurring randomly.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:51.040
 And the evidence is just overwhelming against that, that the genetic problems almost always develop after the cancer is in progress.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:37:03.040
 The over-stimulation and under-supply of energy to the cell keeps the DNA from being repaired.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:12.040
 So the stress causes the mutation rather than the mutation causing the cancer.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:20.040
 But the inherited genes such as what's it called, BRCA?

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.040
 Right.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.040
 BRCA1 and 2.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.040
 Yeah.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:36.040
 That is simply an indication that the person is more sensitive to stress and to estrogen toxic effects.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:45.040
 So the anti-estrogen programs are more important, more effective for protecting them.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.040
 Okay.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:51.040
 All right, we are listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor, KMED, Galbraithville, 91.1 FM.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:55.040
 From now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, we're inviting callers to ask questions

00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:01.040
 or contribute with whatever they are experiencing with, if they have questions for Dr. Peat,

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.040
 around tonight's subject of breast cancer.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:11.040
 Numbers 923 3911 if you're in the area or there's an 800 number which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD,

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:15.040
 1-800-568-3723.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:21.040
 So Dr. Peat, let's quickly look at a strategy, a strategy, a lifelong strategy, if you like.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.040
 It's never too late to change.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:27.040
 Some people leave it to the last minute, some people get on board fairly quickly.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:33.040
 But in terms of the strategy to prevent that likelihood of occurring, given that you're

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:40.040
 saying it's very much stress-related and the effects of stress probably bringing in things

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:48.040
 like nitric oxide and estrogen directly increased in stress, how would you look at best avoiding

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.040
 that?

00:38:49.040 --> 00:39:00.040
 When you look at stress, the falling blood sugar and rising lactic acid are universal

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.040
 features of stress.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:11.040
 And it happens that lactic acid is the main signal for producing the endorphins, the endogenous

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.040
 opiates.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:23.040
 And if you look at the effects of stress, they're very closely all down the line associated

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:33.040
 with an excess and prolonged production of the endogenous opiates.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:43.040
 And everything that is uncomfortable will increase your tendency to overproduce lactic

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.040
 acid, hyperventilating, for example, from anxiety.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:54.040
 When your carbon dioxide goes down, your lactic acid goes up.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:40:06.040
 And strangely, the endorphins didn't get any of the bad connotations of morphine.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.040
 I know.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.040
 I mean, you hear the word endorphin and you think, gosh, it's good.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.040
 Yeah.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:19.040
 A study at University of California in San Diego in the, I think it was dermatology department,

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:27.040
 they were experimentally giving people massages and measuring their various stress hormones.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:40.040
 They saw that massaging lowered the beta endorphin and everything, pain or overexertion, anything

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:46.040
 that interferes with the energy supply will increase the opiates or endorphins.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:51.040
 So, you would think that having a massage would increase your endorphins when in reality,

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.040
 of course, it's the opposite of what you're told.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.040
 Because the endorphins are not good.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.040
 Okay.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.040
 All right.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:02.040
 Can I move on to the aromatase inhibitors that are, I think have become...

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:07.040
 Well, I think what Dr. Peat was trying to get to there is that the low dose naltrexone

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:12.040
 is being used therapeutically by a lot of doctors and it's very useful because it lowers

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:17.040
 those endorphins that are so harmful, all those endogenous opiates, opiates your body

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.040
 produces naturally that can be harmful in times of stress.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.040
 Yeah.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:33.040
 And everything you do that's good, pleasure such as the massage will have that same effect

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:38.040
 of protecting you against the endorphins and nitric oxide.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:51.040
 So, the naloxone or naltrexone low dose treatment has a wide range of anti-stress effects, including

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.040
 protection against promotion of cancer.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:00.040
 And the happy factor too, right?

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:09.040
 Well, serotonin and endorphins are often called the happy hormones, but actually they are

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:14.040
 the most important mediators of stress.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:24.040
 And downstream, even though estrogen turns on lactic acid and endorphins and nitric oxide,

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:39.040
 the endorphins in turn activate estrogen receptors, aromatase, prolactin, which acts as an amplifier

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:42.040
 of estrogen's effect.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:50.040
 You get this back and forth action, increasing inflammation, estrogenicity and lowering

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.040
 energy production.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:57.040
 Wow, so what can we do Dr. Peat to lower this estrogen with our diet?

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:08.040
 The foods that naturally contain anti-aromatases I think are very important.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:15.040
 I always mention orange juice and guavas, but there are lots of fruits and vegetables

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:20.040
 that contain similar chemicals.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:29.040
 So, the naringenin is found in orange juice, but also in higher levels in the skins.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.040
 Is that what you were saying Dr. Peat?

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.040
 The orange is the skin?

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.040
 Orange skin?

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:40.040
 Both the juice and the peeling contain the protective things.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:46.040
 So, marmalade is another source of protective substances.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:51.040
 Anti-estrogen, breast cancer preventative compound.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.040
 And then what about apigenin?

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:56.040
 That's another aromatase inhibitor that you were mentioning.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:04.040
 Yeah, I think guavas and celery and parsley are highest sources of that.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:11.040
 Okay, and COX-2 inhibitors were another rationale for blocking aromatase.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:22.040
 Yeah, aspirin for about 20 years I've been mentioning aspirin as probably the safest

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:29.040
 first thing that anyone who worries about breast cancer should start.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:40.040
 It is a very effective way to turn off estrogen production and response to estrogen.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:44.040
 And how much a day would you recommend?

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:53.040
 People with aggressive cancer probably should take 4 to 6 grams.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:45:02.040
 And in that case, they also need to take vitamin K to prevent a bleeding problem.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:08.040
 Yeah, up until I had a patient who was taking 6 grams of aspirin a day,

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.040
 and they just started to get the ear ringing.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.040
 So, up until that point where you get the ear ringing,

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:15.040
 then you know you're at the maximum and you want to back off just slightly

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.040
 until you don't get that ear ringing.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.040
 But you have to use a milligram, not a microgram,

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.040
 but a milligram of vitamin K for every normal standard aspirin tablet,

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.040
 which is 325 milligrams.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:31.040
 I just wanted to bring out a couple of plant-based aromatase inhibitors

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.040
 that I know we were taught about when we were studying.

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:41.040
 Misulto, misulto has been shown to be an aromatase inhibitor,

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:45.040
 and I know work was done with cancer probably for that same reason,

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:49.040
 or maybe inadvertently they figured that it was helpful

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.040
 probably through an estrogen blocking activity.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.040
 Do you know much about misulto?

00:45:54.040 --> 00:46:01.040
 Physiologically, how you would rationalize it?

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:07.040
 About 50 years ago, I ran into some anthroposophy people

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.040
 who got me interested in it,

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:16.040
 and so I've followed the research on it,

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:21.040
 but I don't think anything very new has turned up.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.040
 Okay, because the other things they mentioned were,

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.040
 and you did mention this last month, white button mushrooms.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.040
 I think the brown button mushrooms are just the same kind of compounds,

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:34.040
 but there are aromatase inhibitors in white button mushrooms,

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:38.040
 and I know you mentioned a dose last month

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:43.040
 that would be a realistic dose as an aromatase inhibitor.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:49.040
 Yeah, the Chinese study found that women who had at least 10 grams a day on average

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:55.040
 had extremely low cancer mortality,

00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:01.040
 and especially if they had green tea too, like 88% lower.

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:05.040
 Okay, and then I think the last two things were coffee and--

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.040
 And tea.

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.040
 Coffee and green tea, yeah.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.040
 And normal black tea too.

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:13.040
 I mean, they would all have the same compound.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.040
 Okay.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.040
 And there was a caller who called in about black cohosh,

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.040
 and that is an estrogenic herb,

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:24.040
 and I would not recommend that for treatment or use with patients with breast cancer,

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.040
 or I would not recommend it to prevent breast cancer.

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:33.040
 Okay, so people that are going through breast cancer treatment,

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:38.040
 and I don't mean to ask you about this because I know you're definitely not in favor of it,

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:44.040
 but the chemotherapy, radiotherapy approach to cancer is just not doing it, is it?

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.040
 Yeah, there's a website that--

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:51.040
 I'm not sure what is available on it,

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:57.040
 but he has written some very good articles on the issue of when

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.040
 and whether to treat certain types of cancer.

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:07.040
 His name is Gershom Zajicek, Z-A-J-I-C-E-K.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:13.040
 And his accent, now that he has YouTube videos, it's hard to understand,

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:19.040
 so if you can find his written articles, they're quicker to get through.

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:26.040
 But from the time of Hippocrates, I think Hippocrates said that for internal cancer,

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:34.040
 patients who are not treated will last a long time, but those who are treated die quickly.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.040
 Gershom Zajicek makes a similar point.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:43.040
 And 50 years ago, a Berkeley professor, Hardin Jones, did a study

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:51.040
 and clearly showed that the longer a person waits before treating a cancer,

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.040
 the longer they live.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:59.040
 Well, and also there was a study that showed 95% of people over the age of 50

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.040
 had some form of abdominal cancer.

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.040
 Yeah, an autopsy if they died before.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:09.040
 Yeah, if they died, like in a car crash or for some other unrelated to cancer reason.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:13.040
 And 95% of people do not die of cancer.

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:18.040
 Another person said that looking at all of the organs,

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:23.040
 100% of people by the age of 50 have diagnosable cancer somewhere.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:27.040
 We do have a caller on the air, so let's take this next caller.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.040
 Caller, you're on the air, and where are you from?

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.040
 Garboville, downtown Garboville.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.040
 Okay, go ahead.

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:37.040
 Thank you, gentlemen and lady, for your wisdom and your knowledge.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:43.040
 I have a question about a while back I thought I understood that

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:51.040
 in all the skunky vegetables, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, that kind of stuff,

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.040
 that there's a lot of estrogen in those vegetables naturally.

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.040
 Is that true?

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:59.040
 They certainly contain lots of sulfur compounds.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.040
 Dr. Peat, I think there is a--

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:08.040
 Well, they're so thyroid suppressive that they allow estrogen to build up naturally in men and women

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:13.040
 because men actually usually have a lot higher levels of estrogen than women.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.040
 But are they directly estrogenic, Dr. Peat?

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:27.040
 There are some studies in animals showing a direct estrogenic effect of DIM and its metabolite.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.040
 IP3?

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.040
 Yeah.

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:36.040
 Those are commonly touted as breast cancer preventative, endometrial cancer preventative compounds,

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:43.040
 and Dr. Peat just said that there's lots of studies showing that they can have estrogenic effects of themselves.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:49.040
 So I would say that sometimes they probably do have good effects,

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.040
 but I would wait for more research on them.

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:58.040
 Okay, well, I'm not going to worry about how many Brussels sprouts or cabbage I eat.

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:04.040
 And I want to thank you kindly for your wealth of information, Dr. Peat, over the years here.

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.040
 Thank you. Good night.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:10.040
 If you're still listening, Collar, you can cook your kale,

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:13.040
 which is the most nutritious out of all of them, very, very well,

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:19.040
 and cook it with lots of coconut oil, and you will reduce some of the thyroid suppressive effects.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.040
 Excellent. Thank you.

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:23.040
 Okay. All right.

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.040
 So were you going to say anything, Dr. Peat?

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:40.040
 Yeah, on the topic of stress and cancer, about 15 or 20 years ago, Carl Simonton was in the news recommending emotional therapy

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:56.040
 for changing your attitude, visualizing, trying to have anything to reduce stress as a way to improve survival.

00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:03.040
 He noticed that he was a radiation treater of cancer,

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:10.040
 and he noticed that with the same treatment, his patients who were cheerier lived longer.

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:23.040
 And later, a group at Stanford and UC Berkeley did a study in which one group of women with advanced breast cancer

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:34.040
 were given some kind of emotional counseling, and a similar number was just treated in a standard way.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:38.040
 The ones with the counseling lived twice as long.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:43.040
 Yeah. The mind-body connection is underestimated.

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.040
 So it shows the mind controls all.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:48.040
 We do have another caller on the air, so let's take this caller.

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:52.040
 Caller, you're on the air, and where are you from?

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.040
 Hello, caller, you're on the air, where are you from?

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.040
 Yes, hello?

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.040
 Hi.

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:59.040
 Yeah, I'm from Garreville.

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:04.040
 I'd like to, you mentioned the cabbage and the...

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:07.040
 And you should turn the radio down, caller, because your radio's on.

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.040
 Or the something's on.

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:13.040
 Oh. Okay, well, I want to, is it okay now?

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.040
 Yeah, it's just the same.

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.040
 Oh, okay, hold on, I'll put it down.

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:31.040
 [Silence]

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.040
 Well, while we're waiting for--

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.040
 Hello, is that better?

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.040
 Yeah, that's better, thank you.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:38.040
 Okay, yeah, I always heard that, I think they call it cruciferous vegetables.

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.040
 Right, yeah, it's the brassicas.

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:46.040
 Broccoli and cauliflower and cabbage were very anti-cancer and were good for you,

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.040
 and especially the colon.

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:51.040
 Now, I tend to like to eat a lot of raw cabbage in salad.

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:57.040
 Is it any better if you don't cook it or you do cook it?

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.040
 You say that it suppresses thyroid?

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:02.040
 Yeah, it suppresses your basic energy currency of your body,

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.040
 your body's ability to use oxygen.

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:08.040
 And if it's raw, it's very potent.

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:12.040
 Actual thyroid drugs used to treat hyperactive thyroid

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:15.040
 have the same exact compound that's in cabbage juice.

00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:20.040
 So raw cabbage is particularly harmful to your energy metabolism of your body.

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:28.040
 But leaves in general can stimulate the intestine so it has a speedier transit,

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:33.040
 and that reduces the recycling of estrogen.

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:37.040
 The liver excretes estrogen in the bile,

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:41.040
 and if you have slow transit, tend to be constipated,

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:47.040
 and then much of that estrogen is reabsorbed and circulates again in the body.

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:50.040
 So in other words, if you do eat something like cabbage,

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.040
 it can make everything move through your intestines more quickly.

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:57.040
 Right, but there's safer things you can eat to get your intestines moving,

00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:00.040
 like raw grated carrot, and you could eat spinach or chard

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:02.040
 that you cook with a little bit of baking soda,

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.040
 and that will get your intestines moving.

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:06.040
 What about raw foods?

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:09.040
 I heard that they have good enzymes in them,

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:14.040
 they help digest the cooked food, like if you have salad with raw--

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:19.040
 okay, carrots and cabbage and lettuce and that sort of thing,

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.040
 that that's good for you.

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:23.040
 Dr. Peat?

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:29.040
 There's always the risk that since humans can't digest cellulose at all,

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.040
 but bacteria can,

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:38.040
 the uncooked food is great for bacterial replication

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:42.040
 but very poor for human nutrition.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:46.040
 And so it's a risk and can cause--

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.040
 Well, what about fresh fruit?

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:51.040
 Well, fresh fruit doesn't have such high cellulose content.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:55.040
 Yeah, the low-fiber fruits are very good.

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:59.040
 So, but you don't think raw vegetables are good?

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:04.040
 Only raw carrot because the bacteria can't digest the raw carrot fiber like they can--

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:08.040
 But if everything-- if it helps move through your intestines quickly--

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.040
 Well, then that's why you choose the things that are safer

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:12.040
 to help your intestines move more quickly.

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:16.040
 Well, then why do we keep hearing that one of the best things to eat

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:20.040
 to prevent cancer is the cruciferous vegetables?

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:23.040
 Unfortunate misinformation.

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:27.040
 Why do we keep hearing that HRT is supposed to be protective for your bones?

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.040
 Why do we keep hearing that estrogen is good for you?

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.040
 Why do we keep hearing that sugar is bad for you?

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.040
 It's unfortunate.

00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.040
 I'm going to have to call that the evening,

00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.040
 but thank you so much for the callers who called in,

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.040
 and thank you, Dr. Peat, for your time.

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:41.040
 I'll just let people know how to get a hold of you.

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:45.040
 Yeah, I think I just want to sum the show up by saying that

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:49.040
 what you've heard this evening, have a rethink about it

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:53.040
 because you probably never really heard it before,

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:57.040
 and what you have heard is not the truth,

00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:03.040
 and it's so easy to get brainwashed by media

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:07.040
 and by companies producing product

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:10.040
 that it's very important that you do your own research

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.040
 because you will find the truth out there,

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:16.040
 and people like Dr. Peat have spent most of his life researching

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:20.040
 either directly or looking at peer-reviewed papers

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:23.040
 and looking at the scientific evidence.

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.040
 So it's unfortunate we get bombarded,

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:28.040
 but we do have the ability to turn on the computer

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:30.040
 and do our own research.

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:34.040
 But just thanks once again for joining us for the show.

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:41.040
 His number, or rather his website, is www.raypeat.com, R-A-Y P-E-A-T,

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:45.040
 and we can be reached Monday through Friday

00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:49.040

00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:15.040
 [music]

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:19.040
 First you say you do, and then you don't

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:23.040
 And then you say you will, and then you won't

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.040
 Alright, everybody.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.040
 7.59 in the PM.

00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:31.040
 You've got to turn in KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM and HD1

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.040

 the Inn of the Lost Coast in Shelter Cove,

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.040
 Fireplace, Spa and Sauna,

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.040
 and the many sites overlooking the ocean

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:52.040
 offer views of the migrating California gray whales.
