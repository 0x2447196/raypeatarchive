WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360
 Well, here we go. Here it would be the third Tuesday, and that would bring us to a time

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.640
 when we're grateful to have a lovely and talented Dr. Ray Peat on the air on the third Tuesday.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.560
 And as long as the creaks don't rise, he said, we'll do it. He's a PhD, University of Oregon,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.640
 specialization in physiology. Started working with hormones back in '68. Whoa, that's when

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.320
 I started radio in '68 in Armed Forces Radio. He was starting his work on hormones. Wrote

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.960
 his dissertation in '72. He's got a great newsletter that comes out a couple times a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.720
 month that you have a little link there on the show pages. You can get Dr. Peat's newsletter

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.400
 and it's great to talk to him from time to time. If you have an email for him, question

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:00.000
 Patrick at oneradionetwork.com. And out to the left coast, Dr. Peat, good morning.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Good morning.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 How are you doing there?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.200
 Very good. It has started raining. Winter weather is setting in already.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.200
 You're in Oregon, right?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 Yeah.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.200
 You get a lot of rain there?

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:27.360
 Yeah. The weather has been pretty variable, but we're back to the old continuous rain

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.640
 it looks like. The ocean is warming up and when that happens, we get extra rain. Humid

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640
 air condenses.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.480
 I saw the... Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:52.920
 The nighttime rain is the traditional northwest weather, but we have been changing over the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:04.600
 last 30 or 40 years until it looked more like a Midwest climate. Summer rain and drier winters.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.000
 But I think we're back to the old rain in the winter, night and winter.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.800
 I saw with the farmers of Albinac, they use sunspots and they're predicting a cold and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.120
 woolly winter this year for a lot of the country. We'll see how accurate that is.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.600
 I think the sun and the submarine volcanoes are really the important thing changing the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.680
 weather over the long term rather than carbon dioxide.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.680
 Yeah. Submarine volcanoes?

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:50.000
 Yeah. Yeah. The Pacific is really pretty full of volcanoes that actually are warming the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.880
 ocean and they have cycles like sunspot cycles.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.640
 So they put a lot of heat down there and they're going on and we don't really know they're

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.160
 spitting up.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:09.080
 Yeah. And they're teeming with life, primitive life forms that can live at extremely high

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.080
 temperatures.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.360
 And so when the... So the ocean's warm and that causes all kinds of things to happen

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.720
 in the jet stream and change, weather changes more dramatically?

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.840
 Yeah. It changes the ocean currents.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.680
 It's hard to imagine that carbon dioxide is like the devil. I mean, don't we want to keep

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.880
 more carbon dioxide in us by not breathing so fast?

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:55.360
 Yeah. One of the anti-climate change people, he gets up on a box and lectures in London.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.520
 He has a little sign that says carbon dioxide is the gas of life.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.840
 Many people believe that. Gosh, how could you make it so... So political stuff. Who

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.520
 knows what's going on with all that?

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.800
 Well, Dr. Ray Peat is probably one of the few well-known people, well-credentialed people

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.240
 that got milk. You know, he's got that little white mustache thing. And you've been drinking

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.280
 milk for a long time now, and you do good with it.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:36.200
 Yeah. There were times, like when I was living in Mexico City, when it was hard to get good

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.080
 milk, the rich people would send their maids out at dawn to buy up all of the good milk.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:51.520
 And so for three or four years, I went very light on milk. But the rest of my life, I've

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.680
 been a big milk drinker. A gallon a day.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.720
 You're still doing that much? A gallon a day?

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.320
 No, about two and a half quarts, I think, averaging now.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:10.480
 We had an Ayurveda doctor on a couple of weeks ago. And Ayurveda, as you know, you probably

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.440
 do know, they've been a great proponent of drinking milk for a long time. Thousands of

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.440
 years, right?

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.440
 Yeah.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.480
 I want to read you something out of her book. I think you'll find it fun. Her name is Marianne

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.760
 Tittlebaum. She's a DC, but we found her very, very, just, I don't know, very credible. She

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.840
 says dairy is perhaps the most misunderstood of all food groups. The ancient doctors said

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:44.280
 that every food you eat spends three to five days in each tissue before progressing to

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.120
 the next. There are, as discussed earlier, seven tissues, blood plasma, blood muscle,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.800
 fat bone, bone marrow, and reproductive fluids. This means that the food you eat today can

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.520
 sometimes won't nourish everything, all seven tissues, for about a month or so. The only

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.280
 exception to the rule is milk. It nourishes all seven tissues in one day. This milk is

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.960
 seen as one of the most nourishing foods of all life. This is why babies can live exclusively

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.880
 off milk for the first year of their life. Do you think that's accurate with going through

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.280
 all the tissues like that in one day?

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:32.960
 I think some of that is historical metaphor, but there is some basis to it, undoubtedly,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:41.320
 because it's now known that every tissue has its rate of protein turnover, and as your

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:49.400
 nutrients change, the food you eat guides the turnover of the proteins so that you get

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:56.840
 proteins suitable for the type of food you're eating. Every tissue, like bone, is extremely

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:05.840
 slow to turn over most of its substance. Your liver is very fast, the skin and intestine

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:15.640
 are extremely fast, just a few days and they're completely remade. The heart has a slower

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:22.840
 rate of protein turnover, but everything, the mitochondria, the energy-producing apparatus

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:31.200
 is turning over constantly at its own rate. I think in general, the faster a tissue turns

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:40.680
 over because it's kept warm and well-nourished and unstressed, high stress will make you

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:48.240
 turn over your thymus gland and muscles and skin very fast, but in a destructive way.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:57.480
 A good, warm, well-fed condition, you do have a constant turnover and renewal of your tissues.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:05.160
 It's like a streaming. New cells are being born as the old ones are being eaten up, and

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:14.720
 so you clean out the debris at a regular pace according to the tissue.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:20.720
 I agree with you. I think that it's been my experience in the old Ayurvedic texts, which

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:28.240
 obviously is where this came from, they began at some point, they often got off very poetic

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:37.360
 and very beautiful words and they sometimes would expound a bit or maybe say, exaggerate

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:44.600
 a bit on the benefits of stuff. You know what I'm saying? Historically, I think you nailed

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.640
 that not to say it's not true, but they were very poetic and philosophical and spiritual

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:55.000
 about the approaching of different things. I know one thing that I read years ago, they

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.400
 were big fans of ghee rather than butter. I read one book where this fellow said, this

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.520
 sage, "Well, if you have 100-year-old ghee, it'll cure anything." You know, that kind

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:11.760
 of thing. They would make these kinds of statements. I think your point is well taken about the

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.160
 historical, but fascinating.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:22.840
 Now, she's a big fan and Ayurveda has always been a big fan of, not a big fan, but actually

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:28.440
 saying this is the best way, is to boil the milk. Boil the milk for several reasons. I

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.360
 think it helps with the fat absorption and also if you have raw milk, maybe gets rid

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:40.600
 of any little buggies. They put cardamom and cinnamon in there to help do some things that

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:47.280
 I'll find it in here. What about you? Do you think, have you found any benefit in the

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.240
 boiling milk? Have you ever done that?

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:59.880
 Oh, sure. Living outside of Mexico City where they have cows or goats, that's the custom.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:09.480
 Everyone puts a big pot of milk on in the morning and brings it to a boil. Usually,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:16.560
 they skim off the fat that rises and make special dishes out of that or else feed it

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.440
 to the cats and chickens.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.360
 I wonder why you would do that. Wouldn't that fat be good?

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.720
 Yeah, if a person likes it, they have dishes and puddings and things that they make out

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.360
 of it. They use it as a sauce on tacos and such.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:37.040
 Now would there be any benefit to our listeners who can't have access to raw cows or goats

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:44.440
 milk to boil like an organic grass-fed milk that you get at the Whole Foods or something?

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:51.760
 Yeah, surprisingly, the damage nutritionally is very small. It oxidizes some of the vitamin

00:10:51.760 --> 00:11:00.120
 A and a tiny bit of the vitamin C, but milk is still basically the best source of all

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:08.840
 of the nutrients when you compare it to the number of calories and protein in it. It has

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.400
 all of the nutrients except iron.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.160
 How about the cardamom and cinnamon thing? Any thoughts on that?

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:29.520
 Oh, each has its medical uses. I haven't been a big fan of them. Mexicans put cinnamon on

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:35.120
 their chocolate.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.080
 What about this A1 and A2 milk? That's been going around for years and theoretically the

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.600
 A2 milk I guess is supposed to be the most easily digestible. What is that from? Maybe

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:54.200
 the Jersey's or the Holstein's? No, A1 is found in the Holstein's and then A2 is more

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.480
 in the Jersey's or the Guernsey's.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:04.440
 When I was little we had a Holstein and then when I was about eight or nine we got a Jersey

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:12.680
 which we had for 10 or 15 years. I don't really see any difference and I think a lot of it

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:21.880
 is just marketing to sell something for a higher price if you have the right kind of

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.880
 cow.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:29.320
 And Ayurveda says that the goat's milk is good, it's an excellent source, but it's just

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:35.440
 a little bit higher choice for cow's milk. That's interesting. Do you agree with that?

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.920
 Or do you not?

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:47.680
 Well, my own preference is for cow's milk just because I'm more familiar with that. When

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:54.880
 I was in the first or second grade we had a Holstein and the neighbors had goats and

00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:02.320
 their goat milk was very strong smelling and so I learned to prefer cow's milk. But if

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:09.640
 you handle the goats right, the goat milk will taste as good as cow's milk.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:15.920
 So you say you're drinking still a couple of quarts a day. You find that's a lot of

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.880
 food for you and that provides a lot of your nutrition?

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:30.800
 Yeah, milk has always, the last 40 years, has been the bulk of my daily food. When I

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:37.240
 would drink a gallon a day I would maybe have a couple of quarts of orange juice and some

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:47.400
 cheese or sardines or something for a supper snack and eggs for breakfast.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:53.160
 That keeps you going, that will keep you going without losing, keep your muscles going.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.240
 Oh sure, yeah.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:03.240
 How about you now, if I recall your Revolutions Around the Sun which is called Age, you are

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.240
 80, 83?

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:17.560
 Yeah, I'm going to be 73 revolutions in November, we're about 10 years apart. What has been

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:23.360
 your experience, I know you paint, do you have to do other things have you found to

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:33.240
 keep your muscles from, what's that word they use for it, they always have a word doc, sarcopenia.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.720
 Do you have any thoughts on that?

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:48.440
 Yeah, I noticed after about 10 years of just sitting around studying my shoulders got less

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:56.120
 rounded muscles. I could see in photographs that my shoulder muscles were smaller because

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:09.000
 I wasn't working regularly. But just moving around my leg muscles have stayed huge. After

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:18.480
 not going skiing for example for 10 years someone told me that my leg muscles must be

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:25.680
 getting weak from just sitting around reading all the time. But I tested myself doing one

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:37.560
 leg sit ups and every 10 years I would do 10 one leg sit ups and didn't notice a significant

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:43.960
 dropping off with time. I haven't done it for 15 years though, I don't know whether

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.640
 I could still do 10.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.440
 Do you do any other kind of exercise regularly?

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:58.280
 No, just every 10 years I would test myself.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:04.480
 So you like orange juice?

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:13.960
 Oh yeah, when good stuff is available. It should be thoroughly ripened. The commercial

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:21.360
 stuff they are used to selling unripe oranges and so if they accidentally get ripe oranges

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:32.960
 they add acetic acid to it. For example the concentrated or canned varieties very often

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:40.880
 have acid added but the acid etches the enamel off your teeth so ripe oranges are safer in

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.280
 every way.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:48.880
 So you would want to rinse out your mouth with clear water after orange juice?

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:54.000
 Yeah, clear water or maybe even baking soda if it's very acidic.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.480
 What do you think about taking baking soda regularly? Some people advocate that, a quarter

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.000
 teaspoon or so. Do you think there is any value to that?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.120
 Yeah, I know people who do as much as a teaspoon two or three times a day and think it improves

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:22.960
 their endurance and strength but even a fourth of a teaspoon two or three times a day people

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:33.040
 say that it helps reduce inflammation. I know people who used to get swollen legs when taking

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:41.880
 a long airplane trip and when they took a teaspoon of baking soda in water before getting

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.600
 on the plane they stopped having the swollen feet.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.520
 What's going on there? Can you surmise what you think metabolically is happening with

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.680
 the baking soda, sodium bicarbonate?

00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:06.080
 The sodium lowers your aldosterone very quickly and aldosterone is a general stress hormone

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:17.400
 that tends to go up with cortisol which damages tissues but aldosterone causes a shift towards

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:26.000
 inflammation and fibrosis. So the chronic elevation of aldosterone leads to heart disease

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.760
 and circulatory disease and kidney disease. So chronic intake of a little extra sodium

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:41.520
 such as you get with that small doses of baking soda, that has a chronic anti-stress effect

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:54.920
 keeping your aldosterone lower and that lets you lose the sodium fairly quickly and the

00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:01.920
 bicarbonate part is quickly changed. There's an enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, that changes

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:09.040
 carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and bicarbonate back into carbon dioxide and at the surface

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:18.120
 of your cell when you're losing the sodium through your kidneys, your cells change bicarbonate

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:26.360
 into carbon dioxide which is more soluble in the living cell. So it goes out of your

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:32.720
 blood more or less at the same rate that the sodium is leaving your blood, bicarbonate

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:40.960
 into your cells, sodium out of your body. So what it amounts to is the same as breathing

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:52.060
 a little extra carbon dioxide or failing to hyperventilate and low thyroid people hyperventilate

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:59.640
 and blow away the carbon dioxide they should be keeping in their cells. And so the supplement

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:09.160
 of baking soda is imitating to a degree the normal thyroid function, keeping your cells

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:18.520
 more charged with carbon dioxide which is a stabilizing thing that has tremendous ramifications

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:32.600
 everywhere. When you are at a high altitude there's less oxygen and the oxygen normally

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:41.480
 in your lungs it exchanges with carbon dioxide and so at sea level high oxygen pressure pushes

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:49.040
 more carbon dioxide out of your blood. At a high altitude the lower oxygen tension allows

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:57.960
 you to retain more carbon dioxide and people have less dementia, heart disease and cancer

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:07.100
 at very high altitudes and live longer and that's very likely mostly the effect of retaining

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:13.480
 the proper amount of carbon dioxide. So if you at moderate altitude if you're breathing

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:24.240
 more carbon dioxide like adding a supplement it can be with baking soda that extra carbon

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:31.400
 dioxide is to some degree imitating a high altitude or better thyroid functioning.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:41.620
 Fascinating. So the low thyroid folks do they tend to breathe more, have more breaths per

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:47.580
 minute and then have less carbon dioxide which we know is good, is that right?

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:57.160
 Well relative to how much oxygen they need because the oxygen requirement is very low

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:10.220
 in a low thyroid person so they don't need to move very much air. Like a quart of oxygen

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:19.540
 will last a low thyroid person maybe minutes where a high thyroid person would be gone

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:30.320
 in seconds. I've seen it in labs where we were practicing doing the basal metabolic

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:42.580
 rate test by rate of consuming oxygen and for example the typical old fashioned machine

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:53.760
 contains two liters of oxygen and I didn't know that I was hyperthyroid. I didn't have

00:22:53.760 --> 00:23:03.840
 any signs of hyperthyroidism but in the standard test I emptied the machine in half the allotted

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:14.280
 time so the tracing on the graph paper was almost a vertical line where it was supposed

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:23.800
 to be about a 45 degree angle to the right and according to the standards I was about

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:34.040
 four times the normal oxygen consuming rate which a doctor would say oh that's dangerous

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:40.360
 hyperthyroidism but I was fine, no health problems at all.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:53.320
 Very interesting. Do you put much stock in taking the temperature to gauge thyroid function?

00:23:53.320 --> 00:24:10.160
 Yeah, when you're producing energy at a high rate say 150% of the average you're maintaining

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:18.800
 your blood sugar level because you're using the sugar efficiently, not wasting any. The

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:25.200
 hypothyroid person wastes sugar at a terrible rate because they aren't using oxygen properly.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:34.280
 So if you're using sugar efficiently that means you don't experience hypoglycemia and

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:42.640
 so you don't produce very much adrenaline to regulate your blood sugar and so your adrenaline

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:55.520
 level is low, your stress level is low and everything metabolically is running efficiently.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:02.840
 You're turning over your proteins but in a renewal way rather than a stress produced

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:08.200
 way. Here's an email from Beth about thyroid so

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:14.240
 I thought I'd throw it right in there. Dr. Ray P do you think fluoride and chloride in

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:21.800
 a tap water and bromide in breads are having a major effect on our thyroids?

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.800
 Yeah I didn't know they were still putting bromide in bread.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:30.400
 I don't think they are generally but maybe this lady knows.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:39.840
 Fluoride isn't good if it's there, it should be avoided. Fluoride I think, I was for a

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:49.760
 while using a supplement of T3, a thyroid reactive thyroid hormone and when I would

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:56.280
 go to San Francisco or an area where they have fluoridated water I would get a migraine

00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:09.680
 headache and I looked up the amount of fluoride ions in water and the amount of T3, the number

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:23.260
 of potential sites for the fluoride to stick to and a glass of fluoridated water is enough

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:30.480
 to knock out a day's portion of the active thyroid hormone.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:38.000
 Since I was using that active thyroid hormone it was very quick and very noticeable that

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:45.360
 if I drank fluoridated water for example in my coffee or orange juice I would get a migraine

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:52.840
 from extreme hypothyroidism. Cynthia writes in I take 60 mg one grain of

00:26:52.840 --> 00:27:00.680
 natural thyroid every day, it seems my TSH levels are normal one or two, my doctor likes

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.120
 that. Does Dr. Peat think that if I just keep doing

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:11.280
 this that my thyroid will never be able to make this what it needs to on its own?

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:20.440
 I've seen several people who were hypothyroid who when they took the amount that brought

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:29.680
 their oxygen consumption up to the right level had recovery of their own thyroid function

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:34.720
 and could stop taking it. It doesn't happen very often but I've seen

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:40.080
 several people who cured their low thyroid by supplementing thyroid.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:45.240
 So explain what you mean taking the oxygen level, how do we know?

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:52.640
 How would you know? Well if you're sick with low thyroid you

00:27:52.640 --> 00:28:04.600
 have a variety of symptoms and these individuals responded to supplementing their thyroid the

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:14.120
 way any hypothyroid person does but in a few cases they were able to maintain their metabolic

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:21.560
 rate and stop taking the thyroid because the thyroid had restored, the supplement had restored

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:33.160
 their anti-stress metabolism, it lowered the adrenaline and cortisol and allowed the tissue

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:40.160
 to start metabolizing by itself and producing its own thyroid.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:48.640
 And usually a person's body is loaded up with anti-thyroid substances, polyunsaturated fats

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:57.200
 built right into the structure of the cell, not only in the fat tissue but in their muscles

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:05.360
 and brain and so on. Especially after the age of 20 the tissues

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:13.400
 start building polyunsaturated fats right into the structure and when you're under stress

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:19.240
 you release some of those polyunsaturated fats into your bloodstream where they interfere

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:25.280
 with thyroid function. So the average person in their 20s or 30s

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:34.800
 or older needs to, if they're hypothyroid, they benefit from taking a supplement for

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:40.320
 at least a few years until they can change the composition of their body.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:51.040
 Are they better off to take the lowest possible amount when they're doing that? I mean just

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:56.200
 to make it work, to help it make it work on its own?

00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:04.520
 If you happen to take too much you'll get breathless, consume too much oxygen. I've

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:10.080
 done it many times and just standing up to answer the telephone I would start panting

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:20.160
 and I had to cut back on my thyroid. But I've seen people, well myself for example, when

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:28.080
 I was judging just by how I felt I would supplement the thyroid and one morning I noticed I had

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:37.360
 dents in my throat beside my Adam's apple where the thyroid gland had been about the

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:45.880
 size of my finger pressed into my throat and I realized I'd shrunk my thyroid gland. So

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:54.040
 I stopped taking the quick acting T3. The next morning my neck was smooth. And I've

00:30:54.040 --> 00:31:01.080
 seen several people who were taking too much thyroid and have shrunk their gland and in

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.920
 just one or two days it comes back massively.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:14.840
 If one is taking some thyroid meds as we call them, what's the role of taking supplemental

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:21.360
 iodine if you're not taking a thyroid or if you are?

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:29.720
 Foods such as milk and eggs always contain thyroid even though seafood is the known reliable

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:39.360
 source of trace minerals, selenium and iodine particularly. But since thyroid is a fertility

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:49.520
 hormone, animals can't produce eggs and milk if they're very hypothyroid. So you're

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:58.240
 assured that milk and eggs will always contain some iodine and some equivalent thyroid supporting

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:08.920
 substance. So there was a study back when iodine was sometimes used as a dough conditioner

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:19.440
 instead of bromine. And at that time the average American diet contained several times the

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:30.880
 ideal amount of iodine. And it has been about 60 or 70 years since there were hypothyroid

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:37.120
 low iodine areas in the United States like the Great Lakes region was famous greater

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:45.760
 belt. But since food technology has started using so much iodine, there hasn't been

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:57.000
 any iodine deficiency zone in the U.S. And what happens if you take even twice, two or

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:05.400
 three or four times the amount needed by the body, you start interfering with the function

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:14.520
 of the gland. And often people supplement more than a milligram up to as much as 10

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:21.480
 milligrams a day and that seriously damages the thyroid. Every couple of months I hear

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:27.120
 from someone who has damaged their thyroid by taking several milligrams a day of iodine.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:35.960
 Is that a lot of milligrams? Yeah, the required amount is about a tenth to a fifth of a milligram

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:45.040
 per day. And taking a half a milligram per day, chronically looking at a big population,

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:52.000
 that's enough to increase the incidence of thyroiditis and eventually thyroid cancer.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.720
 So it sounds like what I'm hearing you saying is with some good foods, milk or eggs, we're

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:10.280
 going to get enough? Yeah. And it's seriously dangerous in the long run to supplement too

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:18.000
 much iodine. I do really well and others have too. They've mentioned with this, you know,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.360
 the salmon, you can get, you know, the little thin slices. What do you call that? I guess

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:29.920
 smoked salmon and things like that. You think that's a generally good food? Yeah, it's nutritious,

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:36.600
 but you can overload on polyunsaturated fat if you eat salmon all the time. Oh, there's

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:41.840
 poofas in salmon? Oh yeah, a lot of poofa. Really? What are they doing there? I thought

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:55.440
 that's a fish. Yeah, the cold water fish eat algae. The algae is the source of the poofas.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:02.320
 So you tend to, you like to gravitate more towards the warm water fish? Yeah, as far

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:08.840
 as it's available, but a small amount. There are some low fat fish that come from pretty

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:21.480
 cold waters. Cod and soil are the lowest fat fish that I know of. I think they're safer

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:27.520
 than salmon if you're going to eat fish every week. Oh really? Okay, can you stay right

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:35.880
 there? We're going to take a little break here. Patrick Timpone on Radionetwork.com.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:45.080
 One of the most powerful antioxidants ever is actually Brown's gas. Well, hydrogen and

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:50.640
 the machine that we have, the AquaCare machine, makes Brown's gas, which is, it's kind of

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.960
 different than actual molecular hydrogen, Brown's gas, and that's what George's machine

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:01.400
 makes, the one that we promote. It's very quiet and you can bubble in the water and

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:06.560
 then breathe it and they have a whole little setup there, which is digital, and depending

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:11.080
 on your body weight, you know exactly how much to put in there, you just dial that in.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:16.320
 And when you do just the water, you can just dial in 100% of the Brown's gas going into

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:20.040
 the water, drink the water, and then if you're going to drink it and make water at the same

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:29.880
 time, it's fine, because you'll still make plenty of hydrogen in the water. It's a fascinating,

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:40.040
 most abundant gas or thing in the universe, hydrogen. It's just like, I think 96% of everything

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:46.320
 that's out there. So we have a great little machine that we promote, and if you use promo

 thousand bucks, but this thing has got a lifetime warranty, lifetime warranty, and also a one

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:04.360
 year no questions asked money back if you don't like it. Now that's pretty cool. Lots

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:11.160
 of safety features that most of the hydrogen Brown's gas machines do not have, and that's

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:18.200
 important, because hydrogen, molecular hydrogen, and making Brown's gas, it's a very energetic

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:24.160
 substance, let me put it like that. I mean, you can do hydrogen cars and hydrogen whatever.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:29.480
 You know, it's very, it's volatile, so you got to be careful with it. But your body likes

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:34.720
 it's one of the biggest antioxidants and anti-inflammatory. Good things are going in my body with lower

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:40.600
 inflammation. I can feel it. I can just feel it. I don't know why I just feel more comfortable

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:46.360
 in my body after breathing this gas. It's a nice thing. And here's more on it from George

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:52.240
 who makes the machine. This was previously with George Wiseman about his AquaCure machine

00:37:52.240 --> 00:38:01.760
 making hydrogen gas and water out of the same hose. Listen, the body accepts that gas and

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:07.880
 uses it to heal everything. It's like the fountain of youth. It's a astonishing the

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.360
 amount of ailments. In fact, in scientific studies, and they have over 1000 scientific

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:17.380
 studies now, they are showing that it either helps the body heal directly or indirectly

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:22.080
 from virtually every ailment that ails any water-based life form. But it works just as

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.200
 well on animals and plants and lizards and birds and everybody. And you're saying this

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:34.760
 because this machine called the AquaCure split into five different parts. Six. I got hydrogen,

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:41.080
 oxygen, electro-enhanced water, water vapors, monatomic hydrogen, what else? And monatomic

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:47.000
 oxygen. Oh, the monoxygen. And that's what your machine does? It splits it? Yes, it makes

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.200
 that mixture inside the machine and all that comes out a single hose, the same hose. Gas?

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.880
 As a gas, in gaseous form, yes. And you breathe it or you put it in water? So if you bubble

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:02.720
 the browns gas into this water, into let's say distilled water, it will go to a negative

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:08.600
 ORP. And when you drink that, it actually gives your body an electrical energy, these

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:13.000
 electrons. Instead of sucking energy from you, it gives it. So you can have water that

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 is healthful and not healthful just by the energy that's in the water. You want to get

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.920
 one? Me too. Ours is on the way. Check this out. Lifetime warranty on the machine itself.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:06.080
 bifidos. Let's talk about the straight product that is bifido and then there's bifido 2.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.480
 What is the bifido used for? The bifido is used as a probiotic nutrient which has curcumin

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:16.520
 in it and turmeric in it which has certain minerals and nutrients in it that helps the

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:22.960
 body especially absorption of your food. Curcumin is the most researched supplement in the world.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:29.280
 The researchers don't really understand how curcumin works in the body. And curcumin is

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:35.120
 very hard to digest in the digestive tract. So we pre-digest the curcumin which has, we

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:41.400
 buy our curcumin from India because it has a mineral in it called yttrium. And we use

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.320
 the bacteria to break down the yttrium, the correct bacteria to break down the yttrium

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:51.560
 so our body can assimilate it so we can absorb our food correctly and it stops plaque in

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:57.240
 the body. Pretty cool stuff isn't it? Wayne's on it. And the lack of bacteria in the soil

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:04.240
 in this country is the whole issue. Why yttrium is in short supply. Very unique products.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:11.240
 Living Streams. He's talking about the bifido and it's in our store on oneradionetwork.com.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:19.080
 The Ayurveda lady that was on the show, we're going to have her back on, Dr. Teitelbaum.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:28.800
 She was really, really big on Moringa too. It's an incredible tree, nutrient, herb, whatever

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:36.800
 you want to call it. And if you want to get a real natural whey, full fledged whey, Wayne

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.080
 has a Moringa product that's in a probiotic. Very easy to absorb and you get a big bottle

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:47.120
 of it and you can just drink a lot of it. Moringa is pretty amazing what's going on

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:54.120
 with Moringa. So, fun things. They're all in our store. Excuse me. All in our store

00:41:54.120 --> 00:42:06.620
 on oneradionetwork.com. Had to cough there. If you would like to get more information,

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:13.620
 you can talk to Wayne's protege or helper, Marilyn, 360-912-2981. She can give you more

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:26.640
 insights on this or that or what is good for, we have some things for perimenopause. Wayne

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:31.960
 is very careful. He doesn't say a lot of stuff because, oh, you know the FDNA, they get all

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:37.280
 carried away. Can't make any claims. And I understand. But Marilyn can give you some

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.620
 information. She doesn't do medical advice, neither do I or nobody on our guest list ever

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:47.260
 do medical advice. It's all up to you. But anyway, these probiotics work like probiotics

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:52.260
 are supposed to. LivingStreams, oneradionetwork.com.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:57.260
 We talk about your health, wealth and well-being on oneradionetwork.com.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:04.260
 Well, it's an honor to have Dr. Ray Peat on our show. He's consented to come on on the

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:10.420
 third Tuesday and we're here. So, Dr. Peat, thanks so much for coming on from time to

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:17.420
 time. People like you. People like you. You're a rock star around here. They just like you.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:27.860
 What do you know about vasovagal SYNCOPE? An emailer is talking about the vagus nerve

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:40.140
 gets activated due to stressors. The heart rate slows. Blood pressure drops. Blood vessels

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:46.100
 in the legs can dilate. The blood pools in the lower part, flowing to the brain and may

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:53.100
 be nausea and things like that. This lady, Mona, wants to know that what besides the

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:59.940
 stressor is causing the vagus nerve to react so. There has to be more to it than simply

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:06.940
 being a response to being hot, emotional, scared when in a normal life setting.

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:14.900
 Low thyroid people tend in that direction. I wrote some newsletters a few years ago on

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:22.900
 shock and the history of shock goes back a few hundred years, but it really became a

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:37.700
 major aspect of physiology just a little over a hundred years ago, the beginning of the

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:45.020
 20th century. One of the pioneers was George Washington. He was a great physicist. He was

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:52.020
 a son at the Cleveland Clinic, which was founded by G. W. Kryol I. The son was a pioneer

00:44:52.020 --> 00:45:06.220
 in both thyroid therapy and breast cancer treatment. He innovated the lumpectomy rather

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:16.340
 than the horrible radical mastectomy and he practically eliminated thyroid surgery. He

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:23.820
 went from over a thousand surgeries a year in the clinic to just about a dozen by understanding

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:33.220
 how the thyroid can be treated. His father was the real pioneer that led to that understanding

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:41.140
 of the thyroid. His thyroid work grew out of his surgical experiments in which he really

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:54.660
 explained more than anyone else what shock is and how the vagus nerve governs shock.

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:05.780
 What happens in shock is that signals are sent to all of your body cells, turning off

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:13.620
 the ability to use oxygen. The use of oxygen is what thyroid is in control of. The more

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:24.020
 thyroid you have, the more oxygen your cells can use. Within a broad range, that means

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:34.140
 that your metabolism becomes more and more efficient as you use more oxygen. The low

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:41.740
 thyroid person is wasting their energy. In shock, it's even worse than hypothyroidism.

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:52.260
 It simply turns off the mechanism for using oxygen and burning any fuel. It imitates death

00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:03.820
 basically. When a person in shock is cut, their blood stays bright red. They aren't

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:16.460
 using the oxygen in their blood because the tissue is simply switched off metabolically.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:25.620
 It's like turning off thyroid in a nervous or electrical way rather than a chemical way.

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:33.620
 The George Washington trial showed that stimulating the vagus nerve was the basic signal for turning

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:48.220
 on shock, whether it was caused by loss of blood or pain or fright or whatever. The signals

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:58.620
 through the vagus system were able to switch off basically the life process temporarily.

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:10.140
 That process is easier to trigger the lower your thyroid function is. You become more

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:19.700
 of a vagal organism when your thyroid is lower.

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:27.700
 People generally, if they're going to keep functioning at all, they compensate for that

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:39.340
 exaggerated activity of the vagal nervous system by pumping out extra adrenaline. Their

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:47.660
 adrenal glands become overactive and they run as much as 40 or 50 times the normal amount

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:55.740
 of adrenaline production, compensating for that abnormal activity of the vagal opposing

00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:03.620
 system. The parasympathetic system is the vagal system and the adrenaline system is

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:10.620
 the sympathetic nervous system. Surprisingly, many people are running with both sides of

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:20.620
 their autonomic nervous system running at an extremely high rate. If something interferes

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:30.980
 with their production of adrenaline and sympathetic activity, then they drop into the vagal state

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:39.500
 and move towards shock, fainting for example.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:47.500
 Kyle, is that K-Y-L-E? This work seems to feel like it was long ago.

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.500
 I didn't understand the question.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:54.500
 Kyle, this work with G. W. Kyle, was this long ago?

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.500
 Oh, Carl. C-R-I-L-E.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:03.500
 Oh, C-R-I-L-E. Oh, Carl. Okay. Long time ago?

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:10.500
 Yeah, the senior trial died I think in the 1940s and the junior died not long ago in

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:19.620
 the 90s, I think.

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:25.780
 And what did he do to lower all these surgeries that he went from thousands to a handful?

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.340
 What did he do?

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:30.740
 Oh, supplementing thyroid basically.

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:33.500
 Oh, he just gave supplemental thyroid.

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:40.060
 Yeah, things they were calling thyroid cancer. It was just a minor condition that he could

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:45.540
 turn off just by giving them a full replacement dose of thyroid.

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:50.540
 Really? Was he using TSH and all that as a metric?

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:57.540
 No, not at all. TSH measurement came in later really and he used it to measure the amount

00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:04.540
 to realize that people developing these symptoms of thyroid cancer, nodules and so on, were

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:18.700
 experiencing the same condition that iodine supplementers experience with a very high

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:25.700
 TSH. And so he understood that TSH was driving towards thyroiditis and eventually he was

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:33.700
 diagnosed with thyroid cancer. And so he would give usually three or four grains of

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:40.700
 armor thyroid sufficient to lower the TSH to zero. And then these people without thyroidectomy

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:51.300
 or maybe just partial removal of the cancerous part would live a normal life.

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:59.300
 Just keeping their TSH down so that any surviving cancer cells wouldn't be stimulated by the

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.340
 TSH.

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:07.340
 My goodness. Three or four grains. Now a grain is 16 milligrams. I mean that's a lot, isn't

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:07.900
 it?

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:12.700
 Well, two grains was the average dose for just the run of the mill.

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:13.500
 Was it?

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:20.500
 Low thyroid, middle-aged person. But sometimes just to have good functioning, some people

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:28.500
 took three or four or even five grains. The armor company sold tablets of five grains.

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:38.100
 Veterinarians found that that was the right dose for cocker spaniels. A couple of breeds

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:50.780
 of dogs needed about five grains a day and quite a few people, they sold bottles of I

00:52:50.780 --> 00:53:00.300
 think it was 500 five-grain tablets and $10 or so. And I've seen a few people who needed

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:11.220
 more than five grains, 10 or 15 grains a day to cure their problem and then they would

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:15.500
 settle in on four or five grains a day for maintenance.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:22.500
 My goodness. It seems like a very high dose what we hear around. So how did this Carlisle,

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:30.260
 how did he judge the dosage if he wasn't using the labs?

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:38.860
 The basal metabolic rate was still in use through the 1940s and into the 50s. Then the

00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:48.140
 chemical, the first test was a blood test called protein-bound iodine. It came in just

00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:57.660
 around the same time that Synthroid came on the market.

00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:05.820
 It turned out 20 years later that it was an absolute meaningless thing. But at the time,

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:14.340
 I was in junior high at the time and several of my friends said they had learned that they

00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:21.780
 didn't have a glandular problem because the protein-bound iodine showed that they had

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:26.900
 a fully normal amount of protein-bound iodine in their blood. And so they had discovered

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:30.020
 that they were just gluttonous.

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:35.020
 So they brought this med thing out right when the Synthroid came out. I mean the test.

00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:39.700
 Yeah, yeah. It really was part of a marketing system.

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:40.420
 Those rascals.

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:47.420
 What they did was blame the problem on the patient rather than supplementing with Armor

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:51.900
 Thyroid which was a good reliable product.

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:58.900
 My goodness. So back to Mona who brought up this whole Vegas. So she might have on both

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:05.180
 ends working overtime with the sympathetic with the Vegas and then the adrenaline. How

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:11.300
 would then how do you lower all that down? Is it just looking after Mr. Thyroid?

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:18.300
 Using your temperature and pulse rate, you can come fairly close to the old oxygen consumption

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:26.460
 test which that's still the ideal way to prove hypothyroidism. But you can make a very good

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:33.900
 guess by taking your temperature before you get out of bed in the morning and checking

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:40.860
 your pulse rate at the same time. If you're lots of the low thyroid people are running

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:47.860
 on high adrenaline which rises during the night and that tends to push up the cortisol.

00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:57.020
 The adrenaline sometimes will cause 90 or 100 beats per minute heart rate when you're

00:55:57.140 --> 00:56:04.140
 waking up sometimes following a nightmare. And if the cortisol goes up higher than average

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:13.540
 it always tends to rise around dawn. But the higher your cortisol rises the higher your

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:21.740
 waking temperature will be. The adrenaline speeds your pulse at dawn, the cortisol raises

00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:30.540
 the temperature and helps to push the heart rate back down by bringing your blood sugar

00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:37.580
 up. So just that one measurement can be ambiguous, high adrenaline, high cortisol or low. But

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:48.780
 if you then take your temperature and pulse rate an hour or two after eating, the food

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:57.540
 will lower your adrenaline and the daylight and food will lower your cortisol. And very

00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:05.100
 often these people who woke up seeming to have a very normal 75 beats per minute pulse

00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:13.100
 rate and 98 degree temperature, these people will sometimes drop to a 55 or 60 pulse rate

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:22.340
 and 96 or 97 degree temperature at 11 o'clock in the morning.

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.340
 And what does that tell you if that happens?

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:25.340
 That they're super low thyroid.

00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:32.340
 Okay, so the Broda Barnes thing wasn't kind of sort of right. I mean if you had a 98,

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:37.780
 you know according to Broda Barnes then you were good but this whole adrenaline and cortisol

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:42.780
 thing you're saying, maybe not.

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:49.780
 In hot, humid summers in Eugene, I first started questioning Barnes's temperature measurement.

00:57:49.780 --> 00:58:04.780
 He worked at Fort Collins, Colorado where it never gets very hot and humid for very

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:12.980
 long. And I saw that people in this hot and humid weather, even very hypothyroid people

00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:22.340
 kept a normal temperature. But usually with a normal temperature, they would get a slow

00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:30.300
 pulse rate. So I started adding the two together but then I saw that a very stressful night

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:38.540
 time would make both of the indicators sometimes look normal at dawn or waking. And then they

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:47.820
 would go down on a cool mid-morning or afternoon.

00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:54.820
 That's fascinating. That's very, very, very interesting. So you have mentioned before

00:58:55.580 --> 00:59:02.580
 that folks if they want to start taking a thyroid, that they start slow and do it maybe

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:07.820
 even half a grain or something for a couple of weeks. So you think that's a good idea

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:10.820
 to get the body kind of used to it?

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:17.820
 Yeah, that is a traditional way to say ideally a month because your adrenaline and cortisol

00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:29.340
 are going to come down as the thyroid comes up. So at two weeks you might seem just right

00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:37.180
 and then you start slowing down again when your adrenaline comes down towards normal.

00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:44.700
 So maybe 30 grains, half of a tab might be a good thing for a few weeks or a month.

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:52.220
 Watching those measurements because it's like a sawtooth pattern. You're rising up

00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:58.580
 and rise to normal and then your hormones adjust and you slip back and then you increase

00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:05.580
 the dose and rise to normal for a while. And then if you normalize your adrenaline and

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:12.620
 lower your stress, then your metabolism slows down again for a while.

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:17.180
 So that's why if you do both you can kind of gauge. So what you want is after an hour

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:24.180
 or after eating around 11 or so, the ideal would then be the more 98 temp and more higher

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:28.100
 pulse rate?

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:35.100
 Yeah, 80 or 85 in the middle of the day is a good pulse rate. 75 at least and 85 or 90

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:43.420
 is okay and temperature 98 or 98.5.

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:48.140
 Well could you diagnose for Patrick here? I'm like 60 all the time. It just doesn't

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:55.140
 change. I mean it seems fine to me. For me doc if I had 75 I would think I'd be like

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:59.700
 total anxiety or something.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:06.700
 Oh no, the thyroid, one of the things it does by lowering the stress hormones, you feel

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:10.180
 more and more relaxed.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:12.900
 Put the higher pulse rate.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:19.900
 Yeah, but how you feel is a good indicator. You don't want to push it into the anxiety

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:23.860
 because that means you're turning on your stress.

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:30.860
 And serotonin is an additional complicating factor. The vagal system and the adrenaline

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:42.060
 system is one complication of interpreting thyroid function, but the serotonin also tends

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:51.580
 to go down as your thyroid comes up and the serotonin is a promoter of hyperventilation

01:01:51.580 --> 01:02:00.620
 and so the low blood glucose, low oxygen consumption person often will have a higher blood sugar

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:07.620
 and that person often will have an actual hyperventilation driven by the increased

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:17.300
 serotonin and that serotonin disturbs both your adrenal mineral regulation and your parathyroid

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:27.500
 hormone. It drives your parathyroid hormone up and that is worse if you're low in either

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:37.460
 calcium intake or low in vitamin D. That's why I talk a lot about calcium and vitamin

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:46.580
 D in relation to thyroid because low thyroid means usually higher serotonin activity, hyperventilation

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:57.500
 disturbed calcium metabolism and dependence need for more vitamin D.

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:03.780
 We talked a bit about dopamine last hour. How does dopamine play into the whole, what

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.300
 we've just talked about the last 10 minutes, dopamine?

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:14.300
 It's similar to the adrenaline or sympathetic nervous opposition to the shock tendency of

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:25.500
 the vagal or sympathetic system. It's the body's balancing factor for serotonin. You

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:35.940
 can get too much of both of those and you get symptoms like nightmares.

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:51.380
 Water and salt regulation become a problem when those go up. So you want to keep your

01:03:53.740 --> 01:04:00.740
 serotonin down and under control and then your dopamine will take care of keeping things

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:03.620
 in balance usually.

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:07.980
 So on the shock idea, you're talking about it could be a traumatic event in someone's

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.020
 life.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:16.020
 Yes, an emotional shock will turn off your thyroid function and all of those other, the

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:29.420
 adrenals and the parathyroid system tend to get out of control as your thyroid goes down.

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:37.120
 I wonder why though after you get over the shock and you forgive the shock person and

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:44.120
 all that and spiritually and emotionally that these thyroid wouldn't start to get its

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.540
 act together without the meds.

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:54.540
 I think that's because of the tissues having been slightly deranged by storing PUFA in

01:04:54.540 --> 01:05:03.060
 their fat. Usually young people can take a big shock better than people in their 30s

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:11.420
 and 40s when their tissues are destabilized by the fat. An emotional upset will more relax

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:18.420
 and cause a chronic thyroid problem in a person in their 30s and their teens.

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:25.420
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us and you can see on the show page there where he has a bi-monthly

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:44.420
 newsletter and it's very affordable. You can click on there and sign up and get some

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:51.420
 cool stuff and help support him so he can buy paints and stuff.

01:05:51.420 --> 01:06:02.980
 What's more effective, eating a whole orange, drinking its juice or eating marmalade?

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:12.180
 The marmalade has the extract of the peeling which has a lot of therapeutic things. I haven't

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:23.620
 seen any real comparisons but people occasionally have advocated eating the peeling raw but

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:32.300
 that's extremely hard on the stomach and cooking the peeling extracts some of the anti-inflammatory

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:42.060
 things. Naringin are major protective factors in the orange peeling that you get in the

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:52.140
 marmalade and the added sugar is an added anti-stress factor that supports your thyroid.

01:06:52.140 --> 01:07:02.980
 Ideally the juice you can get all of those good things in the absence of the marmalade

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:10.980
 is a kind of a medical substitute. If you have good oranges you wouldn't want to eat

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:26.780
 the number of oranges it takes to make a gallon of orange juice but it's fine to drink a gallon

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:33.780
 of orange juice in hot weather. All of the fiber in an orange would probably be a burden

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:42.820
 to your digestive system. I experience malabsorption that no matter what

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:52.900
 or how much I eat I stay underweight. Symptoms like gnawing, ulcer type pain that flares

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:58.780
 up at night to cause insomnia and eating iron rich foods like organ meats which were previously

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:05.780
 well tolerated now exacerbate this pain. So getting some ulcer type pain at night and

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:14.460
 can't seem to gain weight can you gauge what might be going on for this person?

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:21.460
 My personal experience and knowing half a dozen other people usually men, I can't gauge

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:29.460
 how many people in their 20s and 30s can eat several thousand calories a day without gaining

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:43.100
 weight. I've known people who weighed for normal height 130-140 pounds, very skinny

01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:56.980
 who were eating 3-4 thousand calories a day. Based on my own experience when I first supplemented

01:08:56.980 --> 01:09:06.140
 thyroid, I was in my late 30s I think, suddenly I didn't need to eat so much. My calorie requirement

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:17.420
 dropped in half simply by adding thyroid. So I suggested that to these skinny men who

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:26.020
 were eating 3-4 thousand calories and staying very skinny. Suddenly they had the same experience.

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:34.500
 They didn't have to eat more but suddenly they put on muscle and that shows that thyroid

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:41.900
 is an anabolic hormone when it's in the right balance. But if it's deficient and you're

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:51.620
 running on adrenaline, your cells know that the energy isn't being produced in the right

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:58.140
 way, it's being produced by the stress of adrenaline. So you're burning calories under

01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:05.140
 the influence of adrenaline because these cells can't retain the magnesium that stabilizes

01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:12.840
 the energy level of the cell. Your thyroid can be making you use the oxygen and you're

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:20.840
 producing the ATP and be fairly efficient in those ways. But in the absence of a certain

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:32.800
 amount of thyroid, your cells lose magnesium and so they have to make the ATP again. So

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:40.280
 you're making ATP at a high rate but losing it because it breaks down in the absence of

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:47.280
 magnesium. Supplementing magnesium for about an hour will relax and stabilize the cells

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:57.320
 but you need a certain amount of thyroid to make the cells retain it and stay in that

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:05.880
 efficient relaxed condition. It's a matter of letting your cells relax so that they can

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:15.040
 build themselves up instead of being constantly running and stressing themselves. So that's

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:22.040
 where the thyroid is visibly a very powerful anabolic hormone.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:29.040
 So that's a little counterintuitive because isn't often hypothyroidism connected with

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.880
 overweight?

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:39.880
 Very often but if you look at the old textbooks, at the beginning of thyroid surgery, they

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:49.360
 forgot to replace the thyroid hormone with a powdered or squashed up animal thyroid gland

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:59.160
 and when a person's thyroid gland was removed, they went into cachexia. They looked like

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:08.280
 an advanced cancer patient, worse than sarcopenia. Sarcopenia to an extreme degree, they wasted

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:16.720
 away in the absence of the thyroid hormone and that's what's happening to these often

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:24.400
 young or middle-aged men who are just moderately hypothyroid but it's enough to move them into

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:32.440
 that catectic or sarcopenic state of not being able to build their muscle fast enough.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:42.280
 This is from Cindy. She's in Alabama. I've been told that when a person has Hashimoto's

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:48.400
 or other autoimmune issues, they should not use natural desiccated thyroid medications

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:54.600
 such as Armour or Nasothroid because the body will attack these because they are natural

01:12:54.600 --> 01:13:00.920
 ? The body supposedly does not attack the synthetic medication like Synthroid and I

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:07.520
 prefer not to use the synthetic. What is your view on this?

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:14.520
 The autoimmune so-called condition is an excited inefficient state like when the cell can't

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:24.840
 retain magnesium, it stays in an excited state. If there's a hormone additionally increasing

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:35.280
 the excitation like TSH, it stimulates the thyroid gland and if it gets the nutrients,

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:44.040
 it needs to make the hormone in the right balance, not too much iodine, then the cell

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:51.680
 is energized and works. If something is lacking so it can't produce the thyroid hormone, the

01:13:51.680 --> 01:14:00.360
 TSH keeps rising, stimulating it more, driving it harder, stressing it more until it is killing

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:10.600
 the cells causing thyroiditis. In a condition of inflammation, your immune system comes

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:20.480
 in to activate the turnover, the phagocytosis of the damaged, overexcited, overstressed

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:31.640
 cells. The immune system is clearing up a damaged tissue and that has been experimentally

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:43.760
 shown several times. For example, in artificially inflamed brains in animals, they find that

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:57.480
 what they thought was autoimmune inflammation of the brain caused by a virus or some external

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:04.880
 cause was actually being remedied by the immune system. If they removed that autoimmune inflammation

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:11.880
 and the body, the inflammation killed the animal. The immune system antibodies directed

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:25.000
 against self, if they're properly supported, are cleaning up the damaged tissue, remedying

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:32.000
 the problem. People have demonstrated that where you have the so-called autoimmune antithyroid

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.000
 antiglobulin, antiperoxidase enzymes specific to the thyroid, if they supplement enough

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:52.720
 thyroid to lower the TSH, you stop producing the antibodies and the antibodies, when they

01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:02.480
 finish cleaning up the damaged tissue, will gradually fade away. It takes several months

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:09.480
 of keeping the TSH low. There have been several publications demonstrating that the condition

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:19.000
 corrects itself after several months.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:27.360
 It applies to things like rheumatoid arthritis and several other types of so-called autoimmune

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:34.360
 conditions.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:42.440
 Do you know anything about the calcium powder made from pearls?

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:49.440
 If you don't have any experience with the pearl itself, it's a good source for calcium.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:57.440
 If you have any experience with the pearls, it's a good source for calcium.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:05.440
 And egg shells and oyster shells and other sea creatures' shells.

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:10.440
 But you don't have any experience with the pearl itself?

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.440
 Pearl?

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:12.440
 Yeah, pearl.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:13.440
 No, no.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:18.440
 You don't? Chinese medicine and all you've had to use is pearl for different things, and

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.440
 that's what she was asking.

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.440
 They're made of calcium carbonate.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:27.440
 Oh, they are? Good, so that's a good source then.

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:32.440
 Another question, well, I'm glad to hear. We thought so.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:37.440
 Another source of calcium would be in fish bones, she's asking. I used to eat sardines with fish bones.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:47.440
 They seemed digestible, but now with avoiding poopers, would the bones from cod or some other source be good as calcium source for those with sensitive guts?

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:58.440
 It is a calcium source that is okay, but the trouble is that it is calcium phosphate.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:13.440
 Phosphate has an excitatory effect, and most people are overloading on phosphate, and so the bones will move in the right direction.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:25.440
 But if you're still eating a lot of meat, meat and grains and legumes, for example, are overloading you with phosphate.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:33.440
 And so calcium phosphate helps, but it isn't as effective as calcium carbonate.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.440
 The carbonate, you like the carbonate.

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:36.440
 Yeah.

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:47.440
 I love this show, writes Cody. She's in Florida. Well, thanks, Cody. I'm interested to know, oh, you asked Dr. Peat, how long he sleeps each night.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:52.440
 And do you sleep uninterrupted sleep? She's asking about your sleep.

01:18:52.440 --> 01:19:01.440
 It depends on how good the weather is, how good my food was, and so on.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:06.440
 But seven and a half to nine hours, it's variable.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:16.440
 Usually, I wake up during the night and have some milk and sugar or orange juice to lower the stress.

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:22.440
 Having milk at bedtime will lower several of the stress hormones.

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:44.440
 I've got in the habit of, if I wake up in the night, having some sugar and milk or orange juice and milk, and that resets the hormones so that you don't experience the same amount of stress around dawn.

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:54.440
 Yeah, what fun. So you put, say, if you would have milk in the middle of the night when you wake up, would you put actual sugar in there or honey or maple syrup? What would you use?

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:58.440
 Pure white sugar is the safest.

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:10.440
 Really? Single figure. Pure white sugar from Hawaii, right? Why is that the safest over? You would think honey or maple syrup is a better choice, no?

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:24.440
 Honey is very good, but if the bees happen to eat something you're allergic to, you can have an allergic reaction to the plant substance that gets into the honey.

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:36.440
 And maple sugar is extremely nutritious for minerals, but the heating process makes the sugar allergenic.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:42.440
 I didn't know they heated it. I thought they just kind of dumped it out of the old tree.

01:20:42.440 --> 01:21:08.440
 It comes out in a very liquid, slightly amber color, but a very pale, thin liquid, and it has to be evaporated, and they use heat to evaporate it. Theoretically, you could do it at room temperature with a high vacuum, but it's economical to heat it.

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:27.440
 In the heating process, there are small amounts of amino acids in the juice as well as minerals, and when you heat glucose with an amino acid, it produces a toxic reactant.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:32.440
 So your go-to is C&H pure cane sugar from Hawaii?

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.440
 Well, actually...

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:37.440
 You could probably get an organic one, though, can't you?

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:52.440
 Yeah, you can, but it's so well washed, you get 99 and more percent pure sucrose, but I think beet sugar might even be better.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:56.440
 Ooh, beet sugar. Is that white?

01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:25.440
 Oh, sure. Yeah, they're washed. They would be brown, but they wash the molasses away, and the molasses is brown partly because of the heat process reacting amino acids with the glucose, making a brown substance that is similar to the substance that's produced in aging, reacting glucose with amino acids.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:33.440
 Have I read or did I dream this, that a lot of the beets are genetically modified now? You want to do organic?

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:52.440
 Oh, probably, but you hopefully aren't getting any proteins. The proteins are the allergenic, toxic form, and that's what genetic modification does, is make new kinds of proteins, which are toxic and allergenic.

01:22:52.440 --> 01:23:13.440
 Here's one. I know that Dr. Peters recommended raw carrots, cooked mushrooms, bamboo shoots for the antibiotic properties, but that our gut bacteria can get used to these. Is just alternating with those enough, or should one supplement with doses of antibiotics?

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:42.440
 Oh, yeah. If you're having a problem with hormone imbalance and stress, at a fertility clinic about 35 years ago, they discovered, they had the theory that infertility might be caused by germs, and so they gave some women antibiotics and didn't do much for their fertility that they saw.

01:23:42.440 --> 01:24:03.440
 But a lot of them said that their PMS and headaches had gone away, and so they started measuring their hormones, and they found that in fact it had improved their fertility balance by lowering estrogen and cortisol and increasing their progesterone.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:22.440
 And that wasn't just a fertility clinic in humans, but people then tested it in animals, and a course of antibiotics reliably lowered estrogen and cortisol, the stress hormones, and increased progesterone.

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:39.440
 And that's the idea of the fiber. When the fiber is working, it is binding and eliminating estrogen so it isn't reabsorbed and passed through the liver repeatedly.

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:53.440
 The fiber eliminates estrogen, that lowers the stress, so your cortisol goes down, and that combination allows your progesterone to be retained properly.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.440
 Go figure. That's really interesting.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:11.440
 I sure like Dr. Peat's show. Thanks for having him on. On a previous show, Dr. Peat mentioned possibly placing a red light at your bedside with a timer to come on intermittently through the night to eliminate the reduce of stress caused by darkness.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:17.440
 Could you further ask about implementing this idea and if it would be helpful or not?

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:21.440
 Maybe somebody else mentioned that. I don't know if you said that. Sorry.

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:25.440
 Did you talk about that idea of intermittent red light?

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:43.440
 Yeah. I've tried different things, and it bothered me to have it come on in my face, and so I made a paddle or a belt with LEDs and found that putting it on my leg didn't bother me so much.

01:25:43.440 --> 01:26:00.440
 And shining red light on your blood anywhere in your body has a de-stressing effect, but I have not consistently used that.

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:15.440
 I think it's adequate to have a chronic daylight, continuous incandescent or sunlight during the daytime is enough to lower your stress.

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:35.440
 But I think it is good to have an air ionizer running all the time, especially during the night, because negatively ionized air activates your lungs' ability to lower serotonin and lower the stress of night.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:41.440
 What's an air ionizer? What does it do? I don't know if I know about that. Oh, that's a negative ion generator?

01:26:41.440 --> 01:27:09.440
 Yeah. It adds electrons to the oxygen and it creates, in effect, radical, as far as your lung enzymes can tell, it's activated metabolic oxygen, more immediately accessible to destroy serotonin as it reaches your lungs.

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:16.440
 And the lungs are constantly keeping your serotonin in check.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:41.440
 When a person has a digestive problem that wakes them up at night with various symptoms, including insomnia, that irritation of the intestine is putting tremendous amounts of serotonin into your blood, carried on the platelets, depending on your lungs to inactivate it.

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:54.440
 And if your estrogen happens to be high, then your lungs are relatively inactive in destroying the serotonin.

01:27:54.440 --> 01:28:02.440
 Many things can make your lungs inefficient, leaving the serotonin active, causing insomnia.

01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:09.440
 What do you do in a case like that in the middle of the night? What would be any kind of symptomatic relief?

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:16.440
 Milk and sugar.

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:37.440
 Last month, Sue, she's in Canada, she talked about how, Dr. Peat talked about how protein powders, except for gelatin, contain some toxic amino acids. Please ask Dr. Peat whether hydrolyzed collagen powder is as effective as gelatin powder for protein and whether it has toxic effects.

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:54.440
 I know that the amino acids tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine are the ones that are susceptible to toxic oxidation, and gelatin just doesn't have those.

01:28:54.440 --> 01:29:09.440
 And so you can predigest the gelatin into the amino acids. Hydrolyzed gelatin is short peptides and some free amino acids.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:24.440
 As far as I know, they're easy to digest and are no more problem than natural gelatin.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:35.440
 So you like the Great Lakes gelatin and those kind of products as protein powders go, you like those the best?

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:42.440
 Yeah, or making your own gelatin with chicken back wings and legs and feet.

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:49.440
 Yeah, we've been doing it with the feet in a crock pot and boy, is there a lot of gelatin in there? Holy cow.

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:55.440
 Yeah, it's a lot. I mean, you put that in the fridge and it's just solid, just like solid as a rock.

01:29:55.440 --> 01:30:07.440
 Yeah, that's very good protective nutrition. An adult can use a very high proportion of their protein as gelatin.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:18.440
 A growing kid needs some of those potentially toxic amino acids. Tryptophan and cysteine are needed for growth,

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:27.440
 but once you have achieved full growth, all they're needed for is things like the turnover of cells.

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:34.440
 Renewal is running at a lower rate than expansion of volume.

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:44.440
 I should mention that a fellow, Tony, has put together a really nice little array of these red incandescent lights, the chicken lamps.

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:48.440
 There's five of them and they're on a board with a little switch in there. It's in our store.

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:55.440
 Very well built and you can just probably set this guy somewhere in your living room, I guess, at night or wherever you stay

01:30:55.440 --> 01:31:02.440
 and just shine the red light on you and it would be beneficial, wouldn't it, Dr. Peate? It doesn't have to be all that close to you?

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:16.440
 No, and it penetrates very well, red light. If you've looked at your hand against the sun, you can see red light coming through.

01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:25.440
 That's because red light penetrates very well and the blue and green light is absorbed superficially.

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:32.440
 So, relatively weak red light will penetrate your tissues.

01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:37.440
 So, the length, the distance between these lights is not critical?

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:41.440
 No, the brighter, the quicker it works, though.

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:47.440
 Sure, sure, sure. These guys get pretty hot, so I guess you have to gauge that of how warm you want to be.

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:55.440
 Yeah, in the winter, though, I mean, just keep warm, my boy. How important is an optimal thyroid function to consider, writes an e-mailer,

01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:06.440
 for stomach acid production due to the high concentration of mitochondria in parallel cells where stomach acid is produced?

01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:19.440
 Thyroid makes carbon dioxide and the carbon dioxide is flowing in proportion to your metabolic activity.

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:27.440
 It's the oxidizing function governed by thyroid that creates the stomach acid.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:36.440
 So, you start with carbonic acid and use that to energize the production of hydrochloric acid.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:42.440
 So, low thyroid would often be correlated with low stomach acid?

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:48.440
 Yeah, slow digestion. All of the digestive processes tend to slow down.

01:32:48.440 --> 01:33:02.440
 But gastroparesis is supposedly a mysterious condition that is usually immediately remedied by thyroid supplements.

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:20.440
 Oh, my goodness. Well, let's see. It's time to go here. Let's do a couple more, then we'll let you go.

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:27.440
 What? Oh, there was one here I thought was interesting.

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:33.440
 Many Catholic monks somehow live past 100 while nothing but bread and water.

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:42.440
 Do you think their lack of movement may have conserved their carbon dioxide? That's a great question.

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:55.440
 Yeah, the church, both the Orthodox Church in the Caucasus region and the Catholic Church in South America, for example,

01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:01.440
 they've been keeping marriage, birth and death records for hundreds of years.

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:12.440
 And they've documented lots of people living 130, 150 years and more in these areas.

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:21.440
 In England, they keep pretty good records going back several hundred years.

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:34.440
 And they have the record of one old guy, Old Parr, they called him, lived into his 150s, according to good documents.

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:46.440
 And he was taken to visit the king because he was such an exceptional person.

01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:52.440
 He died shortly after visiting the king and changing his diet.

01:34:52.440 --> 01:35:07.440
 He said he had habitually eaten cheese and bread crusts, very, very cheap, minimal diet.

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:12.440
 But he died after having some banquets with the king.

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:17.440
 Oh, because they eat all this rich food, the king's.

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:24.440
 And an autopsy found that there was no disease in his body in his 150s.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:33.440
 And in Abkhazia in the Caucasus and Vilkabamba in the Andes,

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:42.440
 there are well documented multiple cases of people in their 140s and 50s and older.

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:45.440
 And what kind of diets did they get to 140?

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:48.440
 Very simple diets.

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:57.440
 And those are high altitude areas where they have both sheep, goats and cows.

01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:04.440
 And so they eat a good proportion of milk and cheese in their diet,

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:13.440
 as well as having the high altitude environment that spares their carbon dioxide.

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:32.440
 And the monks and priests have usually a very simple routine diet.

01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:40.440
 I think sometimes they might fall into just the right balance of nutrients, not too much meat, for example.

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:48.440
 Meat is a very pro-aging thing because of the low calcium, high phosphate content.

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:54.440
 I think that the high phosphate is probably one of the life-shortening things.

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:57.440
 So there we are with the phosphate again.

01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:05.440
 You don't generally think, or maybe I don't, I'm just not thinking properly about bread as being nutritious.

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:12.440
 But I guess it depends on the original grain and how it's made and everything.

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.440
 A little bit, yeah.

01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:23.440
 If it's made traditionally, letting the yeast rise gradually, keeping the grain moist,

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:29.440
 the grain thinks it's sprouting when you let it leaven naturally.

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:37.440
 The moisture activates enzymes that break down the gluten and reduce the toxicity and make it more digestible.

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:42.440
 So it's a reliable, simple carbohydrate source.

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:48.440
 And it does provide the trace minerals.

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:58.440
 And if they have cheese or milk to balance that, the calcium becomes the predominant mineral,

01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:03.440
 which I think has an anti-stress, life-prolonging effect.

01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.440
 Well, that's kind of fun. You could just live on toasted cheese sandwiches and milk.

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.440
 That would be kind of cool.

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:11.440
 Okay, finally, what's your take?

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:14.440
 I don't know if we've ever asked you about this, about the whole gluten thing.

01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:21.440
 Give us your, to kind of wrap up your opinion on what's going on with this gluten sensitivity,

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:25.440
 or how it began and stuff.

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:34.440
 Partly, the seeds and grains have their plant defense systems.

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:49.440
 Leaves contain insecticides and flavor irritants that discourage grazing from cows and insects and worms and such.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:56.440
 And the seeds are very important for the plant's survival, just like the leaves.

01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:11.440
 The worst toxins tend to be put in the seeds to block digestion and cause as much trouble for the predator of the plant as possible.

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:20.440
 And polyunsaturated fats are able to inhibit digestion if they're an oily seed.

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:34.440
 And the high-gluten seeds, the gluten itself is able to block digestive processes and cause inflammation.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:51.440
 There are parts of the gluten molecule that have similar effects to estrogen for creating allergic reactions in the intestine, inflammatory reactions.

01:39:51.440 --> 01:40:02.440
 And if you let the enzymes activate the seeds so that, as far as it knows, it has succeeded in becoming a plant,

01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:23.440
 then the intense toxins of the seed have been inactivated and you have the stem chemicals, which are much less toxic than either the mature leaf or the seed.

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:34.440
 So leavened bread is detoxified basically when it's soaked for about 12 hours in moisture.

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:42.440
 So is the gluten sensitivity a real thing?

01:40:42.440 --> 01:41:01.440
 Yeah, it's an objective thing that if your immune system is very active and stable, you can adapt to it and pass it along quickly enough without damage.

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:10.440
 Have you had experience with some of this real ancient wheat, einkorn, the real deal? Have you ever experienced any of that?

01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:23.440
 If they aren't leavened, the smaller seeds have some of the more intense toxins, same with small beans.

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:36.440
 The embryo is a larger part and the storage protein is smaller, but there are some very intense allergens in the smaller, more primitive seeds.

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:43.440
 So it's still important to make sure they're well leavened.

01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:50.440
 So the leavening, the yeast and the sourdough make it nicer for us?

01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.440
 Yeah, less allergenic.

01:41:52.440 --> 01:42:00.440
 So if you were going to do some sprouts, do you do sprouts at all? Do you make your own sprouts at all?

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:02.440
 Not for many years.

01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:11.440
 If you were going to do some, somebody wants to know what would be your favorites to do? The most digestible is what they're asking, George.

01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:24.440
 Oh, they're all vastly more digestible than the seeds, but they should be cooked. To improve their digestibility, they should be well cooked.

01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:26.440
 Oh, you cook sprouts as well?

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:47.440
 The Chinese, either a bean or a grain, if it's fully sprouted, develops at least twice as much protein value as was in the bean or the grain itself.

01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:54.440
 So you're getting an actual protein supplement when you're sprouting.

01:42:54.440 --> 01:43:02.440
 We used to do black beans and other beans, aduki beans, and you can sprout those guys just on a wet towel, right?

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:10.440
 And you can see a little tail come out, and then you can cook them. So it really soups up the protein, huh?

01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:15.440
 At the same time that it's reducing the allergenicity and toxicity.

01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:20.440
 Wow. And you can pretty much sprout any kind of bean, can't you, Doc? Can you soak them first and sprout them?

01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:33.440
 Yeah, if they haven't been sterilized, which some products in the U.S. supermarkets have been irradiated or heated or chemically treated.

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:39.440
 Do you know if they can irradiate organic? Do we know if that's a protection, being organic?

01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:45.440
 I haven't heard what the latest standards are, but they're pushing in that direction.

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:50.440
 Are they? Yeah. Well, Doc, so it's such an honor to have you on and people love you.

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:54.440
 And you're just one of our most popular podcasts around here. You get a lot of hits.

01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:58.440
 So thank you for that. Final question before you go.

01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:10.440
 What are you are you focused on anything in particular research wise that maybe we'll talk about next month or anything that's really have your has your interest?

01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:25.440
 Yeah, I'm trying to put together a more systematic picture of how serotonin fits into stress and aging.

01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:43.440
 It probably is a point where intervention to reduce sickness, autoimmunity and age related degenerative conditions.

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:53.440
 I think aiming towards lowering serotonin is going to be one of the most productive things.

01:44:53.440 --> 01:45:09.440
 I see research moving in that direction, contrary to the powers of the pharmaceutical industry, which want to still say serotonin is wonderful stuff.

01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:33.440
 You should buy our antidepressants, but there are alternative antidepressants being demonstrated to be safer while lowering serotonin and promoting health rather than degrading health.

01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:42.440
 So that's the research you're working just off the top to do. Did I ask you? Sorry if I if I did some natural ways to lower the serotonin.

01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:46.440
 Did we did we talk about that?

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:58.440
 Yeah, we've already covered a lot of thyroid, vitamin D, calcium, sugar and the things in orange juice.

01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:04.440
 Oh, good. All our favorite things. Calcium and orange juice, vitamin D. Good.

01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:08.440
 Well, Dr. Peat, thanks for being here. And we'll we'll see in about a month or so.

01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:15.440
 And maybe we'll have more to talk about serotonin. Dr. Peat's website is raypeat.com.

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:23.440
 And we'll have a link to that and also right to a place where you can sign up for a for a heads up every other month.

01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:30.440
 How much does your does your love twenty eight dollars by email twenty for how long?

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:33.440
 Two years. That's good for you.

01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:37.440
 So every other month you get twelve issues for twenty eight dollars. Good job.

01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:41.440
 All right, Dr. Peat. Thank you for being here. We'll see you real soon.

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:44.440
 OK. OK. Thank you. Yes, sir. Bye bye.
