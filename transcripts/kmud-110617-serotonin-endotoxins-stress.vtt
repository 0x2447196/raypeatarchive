 And support for KMUD comes in part from The Stonery.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 They're in Garberville. Their second anniversary party is Friday, June 24th, noon to 7pm,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 with grilled all-beef hot dogs and drinks for lunch, cooked by the South Fork Booster Club.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Music from 3 to 7 with train wrecked.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 There will be all-day long silent auction and raffles to benefit South Fork High's Booster Club.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 And without further ado, we're going to bring you our evening's program, Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 [Music]

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Don't forget everything we talked about with Dr.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 [Music]

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 He's waiting.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 My name's Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8pm,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herb extracts, which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 or which are sourced from other USA Organics certified organic suppliers.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor, KMU DeGarboville, 91.1 FM,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're all invited to call in with any questions,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic, a mixed topic of endotoxin, stress and depression,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 and how the body is affected physiologically.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 And we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us on the show this evening.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 And like I said, from 7.30, or in fact, if people want to call a little earlier than that, if they have pressing questions,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 yeah, please do phone up and Dr. Peat's available with his collective wisdom to answer questions on many different subjects,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 maybe not just pertinent to this evening's discussion on endotoxin and stress.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 So Dr. Peat, thank you for joining us again this evening.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Yeah, hi.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 As always, there's people I'm sure who've just tuned in now who maybe never heard the show and never heard you.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Would you be able to let people know your specific interests and your professional academic background?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 Yeah, I studied biology at the University of Oregon,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 and my dissertation was on aging of the oxidative processes in relation to reproduction

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 and how the hormones change with aging and affect the efficiency of oxidative metabolism.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 And the main hormones that I've studied over the years have related directly to estrogen, progesterone and thyroid,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 and the nutritional and environmental factors that influence those

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 and how all of the minor hormones and signaling substances in the body are interrelated between the environment

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 and those hormones and the respiratory energy production.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Okay, thank you for that.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 So if people want to call in, the number here is KMUD 923-3911, the area code 707.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 And so from 7.30 to the end of the show at 8 o'clock, people are welcome to call in.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Now, Dr. Peat, I know that you have a rather unique view of physiology and biology,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 which is different somewhat to the scientific -- we'll call it the regular scientific,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 because I know your methodology is very scientific.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 But the regular biological community and the way that they've done their research

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 or their research has been funded by various organizations

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 has led them to be a little bit inaccurate in their perceptions of how cellular or biological systems are operating.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 In terms of the body, I think probably what we want to try and go through this evening

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 are just to reiterate some of the problems associated with the modern diet, modern nutrition,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 how we've been misled into believing that certain things are good for us.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 And I know we're going to talk about serotonin this evening.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 But in terms of what you've been researching, what you found out, what you've applied,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 will you tell us a little bit about serotonin's effects?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Because I think most people would associate serotonin with something positive, and I know that it's not.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Yeah, since about the Second World War,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 biology has been heavily influenced by several factors.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 The agricultural industry is interested in promoting certain ideas towards food.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 The pharmaceutical industry is promoting a very mechanical reductionist interpretation of health in general

00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 based on the idea of receptors and genetic interaction with specific hormones and receptors and drugs.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 And then there's the government and military orientation that has its commitment to certain kinds of psychology and science,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 promoting, again, the reductionist, anti-holistic, anti-pattern-oriented kind of science.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 So that's why our agricultural USDA recommended daily intake of refined carbohydrates or, you know,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 breads and pastas and those types of foods.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 And that was six to seven servings per day, and that was the bottom of the triangle.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 And you can see that they are actually having their effect.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 In the last 35 years, the consumption of flour and cereals, pasta and so on, has increased by 3 percent,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 just as the agriculture department put in their triangle.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 It should be a fat bottom on the triangle.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 So they've influenced -- the agriculture area has influenced the government's recommended daily intake,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 where if you look at diets from 80 to 100 years ago, the grains were not such a major part of the diet.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Yeah, and in these last 35 years, well, cereals and fats have increased.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Cereals are up 3 percent. Fats are up 7 percent.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 During that time, meat, eggs, and dairy have decreased 3 percent,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 and added sugar has even decreased 1 percent in these 35 years.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 And where many people think that nutrition research should be exploratory,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 looking for new ways that foods interact with the newly discovered biological possibilities,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 the financing is heavily towards industrial food products as nutrients,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 rather than exploring, for example, the thousands of fruits and vegetables that grow in the tropics.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 Right. Well, our country doesn't grow those, so therefore we shouldn't eat them and shouldn't --

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 Shouldn't eat them.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Yeah, that happens with the coconut oil industry, which was used widely in products,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 Oreo cookies and fried foods and so on from about the 1850s on.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 When the soy oil got tired of competition, they put out tremendous propaganda starting 20 years ago

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 saying that the tropical oils were poisonous.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 And what they did was increase the consumption of their unsaturated fats.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 And now heart disease and high cholesterol and --

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 Yeah, and obesity related to high blood pressure, cancer, and dementia.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 And diabetes have all been on the increase.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 Yeah, and these are known to be increased by unsaturated fats and cereals and starches,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 exactly the things the government has promoted.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Well, hopefully a lot of our listeners don't listen to what the government promotes around here anyways.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 I think they don't.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 Okay, getting back to serotonin, Dr. Peat, like I said,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 I think most people think mistakenly that serotonin is good for you,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 and they said people have constantly in the past asked us about serotonin

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 and that it would be good for sleep and good for this and good for that.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 What's the truth behind serotonin so people can realize what they've been doing or what they need to stop?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Well, an example of how confused the promotion has been is that one of the major antidepressants

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 that's called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that supposedly acts by increasing serotonin,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 they knew that it was a good effective treatment for vicious dogs,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 and they said that that's because it increases their serotonin.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 But people studying the dogs after a month of treatment with this SSRI found that, in fact,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 they were less vicious and their serotonin had gone down significantly.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 So it didn't increase their serotonin, it actually decreased their serotonin.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Yeah, I think the antidepressants that work are actually in the long run shifting the balance away from serotonin.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 But it doesn't matter now because the perception is out that serotonin is the good guy

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 and you take these antidepressants and it increases the good guy and you feel better.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 Yeah, over the last 40 years, there have been many papers published showing that,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 starting back with the LSD research, they saw that LSD counteracted the effects of serotonin on smooth muscle,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 and then finally they showed an antagonistic effect where it inhibits the serotonin nerves in the brain.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 So every place that they checked its function as an actual antidote to serotonin,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 it was opposing serotonin and was improving functions such as learning ability,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 many physical symptoms, anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory, many good health functions.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 But because of the government campaign against LSD type drugs,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 the drug companies came out with some modified forms of lysergic acid such as bromocriptine and lisuride

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 and some anti-serotonin drugs that were known to lower serotonin,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 but they advertised them as pro-dopamine drugs rather than anti-serotonin or even anti-histamine,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 in the case of one which was really primarily an anti-serotonin drug.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 But they took advantage of the government campaign against the anti-serotonin drugs

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 to say that the psychedelic drugs made people insane,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 and so they started promoting the idea that their drugs would make people sane and happy by increasing serotonin.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 So that's how it began.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 I know you've mentioned, and if you could just explain a little bit again to our listeners,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 I know you've mentioned the fact that serotonin primarily is produced in the bowel.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Yes, it's a defensive chemical everywhere.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 It's one of the primitive protective reactions, for example, in the bowel.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 It causes spasms that clean out the bowel when you eat something poisonous,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 and so it causes diarrhea and that's protective.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 But in the process, if it keeps up too long, it increases the serotonin,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 95% of it being produced in the bowel and only 3%, 4%, or 5% in other organs such as the brain.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 If the irritation of the bowel keeps up very long, the circulation in the bloodstream becomes a problem systemically,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 and it will cause vascular spasms, vascular leakiness, inflammation.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 For example, when you have prolonged irritation of the intestine, tumors begin to promote serotonin release,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 starting mainly in the appendix.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 The lower part of the bowel is where it's most likely to be overproduced,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 and that systemic effect hits the right side of the heart primarily,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 and then the reason it is worse for the right side of the heart is that the lungs have the enzymes that destroy serotonin.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 So the platelets pick it up from the intestine in the bloodstream and carry it to the lungs,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 where if they're working, they can pretty much destroy all of the serotonin arriving in the lungs.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 But the right side not?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 Yeah, if the lungs fail to detoxify it, then the whole body can be affected,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 but the right side is where it goes first and is pumped from the right side into the lungs.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 So the right side gets it in its crude form, and then the rest of the body, if your lungs are efficient,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 the rest of the body has a much lower level.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 So what symptoms would somebody experience if they do have elevated serotonin leaking from their intestines

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 and then going and acting on the right side of the heart before the lungs inactivated it?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 Fibrous deterioration of the valves on the right side of the lungs and ultimately pulmonary artery hypertension.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 And surprisingly, the lung has some processes that see the opposite of what we usually think of for antioxidants.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 Peroxide formed in the lungs by basically what seems to be a toxic oxygen reaction.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Peroxide helps to destroy the serotonin in the lungs.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 So it has a very specific use of free radicals.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 That seems to be how negatively ionized air helps to relieve asthma and many physiological problems

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 and improves mood because it helps to destroy serotonin in the lungs.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Okay, so pulmonary artery hypertension, that's one of the side effects of increased serotonin.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 Yeah, that's where it got its name is from toning up the circulatory system.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 Yeah.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Okay.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 Well, we want to talk about different foods and things you can do to try to decrease the bowels production of serotonin.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 Okay, well, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Gallipol 91.1 FM.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 And from any time really from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, people are encouraged to call in.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 And we've got a couple of questions they may have.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Dr. Raymond Peat's with us today.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 And he's talking about serotonin, dietary changes, endotoxin production and stress

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 and how the medical establishment perhaps have had research done that's skewed, if you like,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 to mention the word skewed in the direction of the funding party.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 So, 9233911 or if you live outside the number here, it's 1800KMUDRAD.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, you were mentioning the effects of serotonin and specifically you mentioned the pulmonary artery hypertension.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 So, if a patient had asthma or a client had asthma and constipation, say, or...

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Or diarrhea.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Or diarrhea, rather.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 And the irritable bowel syndrome is a typical high estrogen, high serotonin problem.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 Have there been any conditions associated with the pulmonary side that would normally not be present in a healthy,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 well, say, healthy person, but somebody who had a good oxidative metabolism

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 and their lungs were deactivating serotonin.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Are there any pulmonary changes that might happen in patients?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 The best established are the asthma symptoms and the pulmonary artery hypertension,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 but I think probably the emphysema category where you get thickening of the diffusion pathway between the membrane cells on the surface,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 between the lung sacs and the capillaries.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 Lactic acid and serotonin are closely connected.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 One increases the other, and it's known that high lactic acid from too much exercise causes many athletes to chronically have an increased pathway

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 for diffusion so that their blood leaves the lungs less perfectly oxygenated than a person with lower serotonin and lactate.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 So, and also with asthmatics, it's very common that if they can remove the food that they're allergic to

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 or that's irritating their intestine, then their asthma goes away.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 Yeah, that's the direct effect of the serotonin on the contraction of the smooth muscles in the bronchial tubes.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 That seems to be where the negatively ionized air can immediately help by destroying the serotonin faster.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 I read in an article here that in the old days, and perhaps we can bring the question up a little bit about purgatives,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 because that's always been something in herbal medicine from Culpeper on,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 prior to Culpeper from the very beginning of herbal medicine in Greece,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 the administration of purgatives was very important.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 And so, to basically unstop people with constipation was looked at as a prime importance in treating inflammatory disorders.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 And I know that you've quoted that inflammation of the bowel used to be a pretty well recorded

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 and quite frequently as a cause of death in older people, but it's seldom referred to now, if at all.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 So, in terms of serotonin, that would have a bearing with that inflammatory bowel situation on autopsy?

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Oh, yeah. When I worked in the hamster lab, we saw that the old animals practically always,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 when they seemed to be dying of old age, were having a bowel inflammation.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 And I looked up a lot of 19th century cases, and it was a very popular diagnosis of death at that time.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Right. Well, and it's also interesting in our herbal pharmacopoeias,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 I'd say definitely over 50% of the herbs that have been traditionally used and passed down

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 and information on what conditions to use them for are either laxatives or purgatives

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 or collagogues that work on the liver or just herbs that help to restore normal bowel function.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 A lot of the herbs that are in the pharmacopoeias are purgatives, are directed at the bowel and treating that.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 And that was, you know, traditionally a very, very important place

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 because that's where we interact with our environment.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 So, how important do you see bowel health to general systemic health?

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Probably it's the central thing that everyone should think about more

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 because the connection can be traced pretty directly to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 and liver disease, heart disease, arthritis.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 They've known for many years that various types of arthritis are alleviated by prolonged fasting

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 because of relief of the inflammation in the intestine when a person just stops eating for a while.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 But the laxatives and purgatives are really the more practical,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 ongoing way to prevent that chronic inflammation.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 Starches and indigestible fibers have been tested on various animals from horses to rats.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 And practically all of the fibers that are used as food additives, carrageenan and guar gum,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 various other gums, oat bran, and even some of the semi-synthetic things, metamucil, agar, and psyllium,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 all have been identified as carcinogens for the intestine and possibly other organs.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 And getting those out quickly before they support bacterial growth.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 And ferment.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 Yeah, the fermenting bacteria are known to increase the serotonin and lactic acid production.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 And the endotoxin that we've mentioned.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 Yeah, and there's a back and forth increase of endotoxin by the serotonin and vice versa.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 And just for our listeners, endotoxin is something that bacteria produce

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 in response to digesting these indigestible fermentable starches.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 Yeah, and all of these, both serotonin and endotoxin, increase other factors such as carbon monoxide, surprisingly.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 That's another of our short-term primitive defensive systems is the oxidation of the heme molecule.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 And that releases carbon monoxide that is protective in some ways in the short term.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 But in the long range, it's known to be closely associated with Alzheimer's disease, cancer, brain injury,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 many kinds of tissue injury, and it activates the conversion of polyunsaturated fats to the inflammatory prostaglandins.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 And all of these tend to release more of the pre-fatty acids,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 so it becomes a vicious circle of starch, serotonin, endotoxin, and so on.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 What would you have to say about the, oh gosh, people talk about dietary fiber.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 What's your take on dietary fiber and what is important?

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 The two that I have run across in the literature and experimentation are raw carrots and cooked bamboo shoots.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 And these don't support bad bacteria? It's all about bad bacteria.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 Yeah, they are antiseptic or antibiotic in themselves.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 You can store them for a surprisingly long time, or other vegetables tend to rot if you store them in a wet condition.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 But carrots are used to living in moist soil, and so they can kill the fungus and bacteria.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 And just as a side note, with hand towels, you know, in the kitchen that you dry your hands on,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 they make these bamboo fiber towels, and everybody knows, like, you have a cotton towel,

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 after one day of it getting used, pretty much all day long, it doesn't smell too nice by the next day.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 I guess it's because it's supporting bacterial growth, but the bamboo towels, it's amazing.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 They don't tend to smell as bad the next day.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 Yeah, I don't think all of the chemicals have been identified.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 It's partly that their cellulose is very resistant to bacterial breakdown in itself,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 and it doesn't have things like pectin, which pectin does support some of the bad bacterial growth and fermentation,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 and the so-called soluble fibers in beans and other legumes support bacterial and toxin production.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 Why do you think it is that the whole industry, both the medical industry and the agricultural industry,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 has been so keen to push dietary fiber down the necks of people?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 In terms of all those dietary fibers that we talk about, that we're telling people that really they should be avoiding?

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 Well, traditionally, we ate a very low fiber diet from--I mean, a low fiber diet from grains.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 I mean, we would have eaten our fruits and vegetables, but--

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 The fibers like the acacia and guar gum, these things are very convenient for food processing.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 Carrageenan is now very widely used.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 They can increase the weight of meat by as much as 30 percent by infecting this water-retaining gum,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 and it's used instead of cream for making ice cream, so it has a very long shelf life,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 where if you used good cream or coconut oil, you could get a very fine texture that would last a long time.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 But it's just a matter of the cheapness of carrageenan and these other gums.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 So just to cover some of the other starches, traditionally, we would have eaten potatoes,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 and South America ate a lot of masa, which has been partially digested.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 So what can we do, Dr. Peate, with the grains,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 or if thinking about how tradition has eaten starches and coped with it?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Dennis Burkett, who sort of started the fiber fad about 30 years ago,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 when he discovered that Africans didn't have a very high incidence of bowel and liver cancer

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 and that they tended to have three bowel movements per day, where Americans are more likely to have one or fewer.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 He said that he thought fiber prevented the retention of the carcinogenic toxins,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 but he was talking primarily about potatoes,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 and when he came to the U.S. and saw that people were interpreting it as oat fiber,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 oat bran and various other grain fibers, a few people outside the U.S. did research,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 showing that, in fact, those increase cancer incidence.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 So if someone were to eat root vegetables and boil them very, very well,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 this helps to break down the starch so it doesn't provide very much food for the bacteria,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 and saturated fats such as coconut oil and butter put on the starches helps inhibit the growth of the bacteria.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 So mashed potatoes with lots of coconut oil and some butter for flavor, or if you need to gain weight, lots of butter.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Yeah, and it happens that phosphate, which you get in the grains,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 this might really be a part of why the fiber is carcinogenic from grains,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 because seeds and grains and nuts are so rich in phosphorus,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 and phosphate stimulates the breakdown of these soluble or indigestible fibers by bacteria,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 and calcium blocks that phospholysis of the fibers by bacteria.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 And so a high calcium, low phosphate diet goes with saturated fats in suppressing the toxic effects of the starches.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 And what about fermenting grains, you know, like traditional sour bread, sourdough bread?

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Yeah, that digests it. The longer it digests, the more it turns into a sprout,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 and the sprout is basically a little sugar and mostly proteins and water,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 where the starch is mostly indigestible proteins and starches with a high phosphate content.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 While we're talking about phosphorus and calcium, I was looking on the web today,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 doing a little bit of preparation for today, and I couldn't believe an article written by a research,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 no, not a research professor, they were a medical doctor, but they were specializing in a certain area,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 and they seem to have an air of credibility about them,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 but they were really putting down the need for calcium and also reducing the need or the international units for vitamin D.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 I think they were only quoting about 400 IU or 4 to 600 IU for vitamin D,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 when I know we've heard and you've mentioned 2 to 4, 6,000 IUs of vitamin D.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 And the calcium intake, they were trying to say that actually more is not better,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 when I think most people's intake of calcium is fairly low, given the traditional sources.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 And I know that you would defend the increase in dietary calcium as being very pro or anti-inflammatory,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 being very quelling.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 Yeah, I was thinking about the diet traditionally of the Maasai and related tribes in the high altitudes of Africa,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 they at least for half the year when the cows are producing milk, often drink 5 to 10 liters of milk a day.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 It isn't exceptional.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 And so they're getting 5,000 milligrams of calcium and more very often.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 And they don't suffer from usual degenerative diseases.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 I think this doctor was talking about all the problems of calcification,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 you know, it's higher when you have a high calcium diet and then the chances of getting calcified, you know, arteries, etc.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 Well, that's something way back in 1940s and 50s.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 Adele Davis reviewed it in her books that doctors consistently get it wrong.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 They think mechanically that if you eat more calcium, you're going to calcify your kidneys and arteries.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 And it's been known very consistently for 60 years roughly that when you're low in calcium and/or vitamin D or vitamin K,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 your parathyroid hormone increases and it helps to increase it from any food calcium that's in your intestine.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 But when that isn't adequate, the parathyroid hormone, it's increased by high phosphate,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 but it takes calcium out of the bones to balance the phosphate and puts it into the arteries and kidneys.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 And so the surest way to guarantee calcification of your brain and heart and arteries and kidneys is to have a high phosphate,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 low calcium, low vitamin K and vitamin D diet.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 Perhaps that study was funded by the producers of Fosamax or those other drugs because they know that if people aren't getting their calcium

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 and vitamin D at adequate levels, that they will have more bone disease and heart disease.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 And some of the biggest, we have a call on the line, but very quickly, some of the biggest source of dietary phosphorus is legumes, isn't it?

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 Beans and peas.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 Yeah.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 Yeah. Okay, so we have a call on the line. So you're on the air.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 Hi, yes. And for just that reason, I've always just chosen the intake in moderation because what kills you one week is the fountain of youth the next week,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 it seems, from these studies.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 So it seems that having a little bit of everything and not too much of anything is probably the best answer.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 And of course, food pyramids, I've never eaten one.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 The closest thing to that maybe is a tortilla chip with that shape, but I always chewed it up first because that shape's hard to swallow.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 My questions are about serotonin.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 I always learn a lot from you, Dr. Peat, and I was always under the impression that serotonin was mainly a brain chemical.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 But since you mentioned its effect on the digestive system, I'm wondering what the counteraction or interaction of melatonin would be in comparison to serotonin.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 And also, is alcohol considered an endotoxin and what foods may actually cause alcohol to be created within the gut?

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 I've heard that people can actually get somewhat intoxicated from alcohol by eating certain foods which ferment within the gut,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 especially good to know since there's a DUI checkpoint in Humboldt County somewhere this weekend.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 And I'll take your response off the air. Thanks for the program.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 Okay, so what part of the questions do you want to go for?

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 If a person has very sluggish digestion, it only happens occasionally, but yeast can grow so freely if the intestine is sluggish

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 and the membrane cells are weak that the overgrowth of yeast can turn sugars into alcohol.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 Some people stay drunk all the time when they have yeast that are able to live in the upper part of the intestine or even in the stomach.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 So then, would those people, if they drank alcohol, would they feel even more drunk more quickly?

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 Yeah.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 Because they already have a baseline level.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 Yeah, and that tends to increase the carbon monoxide. That's the toxic part of it.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 The alcohol itself in those small amounts, chronically, they might be mildly drunk,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 but that isn't probably as harmful as the fact that carbon monoxide is increased by the alcohol.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 That's one of the problems with drinking any sort of alcohol chronically.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 It tends to push up carbon monoxide production.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 One of the problems with carbon monoxide besides blocking oxidative metabolism,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 just like when you're poisoned by external carbon monoxide,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 the enzyme that makes the carbon monoxide releases iron and iron deposits in the brain and liver and other places with a toxic effect.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 And arteries.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 Yeah.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 So how about the connection between serotonin and melatonin?

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 I know you asked that as his first question.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 It's clear for a long time that the pineal gland is converting serotonin to melatonin,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 and it's activated by adrenaline during stress.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 And so it's generally seen to have this reaction to adrenaline and it has opposite effects from serotonin.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 So I think of it even in the brain as a detoxifying system against serotonin.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 And people studying rheumatoid arthritis and heart disease see the same.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 And I think breast cancer was another area where you see the enzyme that is able to convert serotonin into melatonin.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 So it's probably defensive against these inflammatory carcinogenic and degenerative effects of serotonin.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 Would you consider that it would be useful to supplement with melatonin?

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 I think it has its anti-inflammatory effects, but I think it's much better to work at the other end.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 Especially --

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 Making it unnecessary by reducing your tryptophan intake, for example.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 Good.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 And reducing the starches and inflammation-producing things.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 Okay, good.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 And anything that irritates the intestine is going to cause the intestine to produce more serotonin as well.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 Yeah, including unsaturated fatty acids.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 Which are all the vegetable oils.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 I know we have another two callers on the line.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 Actually, one of them was me.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 I was going to ask, when you get your stomach all in knots from either love or fear or stress or whatever,

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 is there serotonin being released?

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 Or what's the biochemical basis of that, if you knew?

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 In what?

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 Our programmer here said that when you're in love or you're really stressed and your stomach gets tied in knots,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 is serotonin involved in tying your stomach in knots?

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 Or is it adrenaline?

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 Under some conditions, yeah.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 It's the thing that causes stress ulcers.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 The main thing, I think, that causes stress ulcers, like the immobilized rats,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 experimentally will quickly get intestinal bleeding and stomach ulcers.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 And if they're allowed to defend themselves in some way, even though they're still restrained,

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 they can block that stress reaction and lower the serotonin.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 And the way they were able to defend themselves was biting on a stick.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 Yeah.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 Quite an interesting experiment, because it's a very good illustration of that ability to defend yourself.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 I think of that as analogous to the two types of muscle exercise,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 the concentric so-called exercise where you're basically walking uphill and shortening the muscles under force,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 and eccentric where your muscles are stretching against the attempt to contract them,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 like walking downhill, it makes your muscles sore.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 I think of the ability to bite the stick as the same as doing concentric exercise.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 They've shown that old people with very damaged mitochondria in their muscles,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 two or three weeks of doing concentric exercises, only shortening the muscles under resistance,

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 they can repair or create new functional mitochondria in their muscles.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 And I think that same sort of thing happens in the nervous system when you can do something protective or constructive.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 Now, I wonder, just on a side note, would the anabolic exercise of perhaps curling dumbbells, I mean, that would be concentric.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 Yeah, mostly.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 So, other weightlifting exercises when you're stationary.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 Yeah, they have machines that will let you put force while shortening your muscles

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 and then let you relax as the arm or leg goes back into position.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 Yeah, because these don't destroy the muscle fibers so much as the eccentric.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 Okay, I think there's two more callers on the line, so let's take the next caller.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Hello, is that me?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 Yes, you're on the air.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 Okay, I was driving so I couldn't call when you were talking about wheat and people having so much refined grains and so on.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 I'm an old guy and I was on the farm in the '30s and '40s and the wheat that were grown then,

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 well, the wheat that's grown now by big agribusiness since World War II, particularly in the '70s, '80s and '90s,

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 has almost 90% more gluten, which is a lectin.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 Lectin, lectin, I don't know how to say it.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 That's one of the problems because you go to the restaurants and stores and they've got gluten-free this and gluten-free that,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 like bread and all, but the reason is back in Grandpa's day we didn't have so much problem with gluten because the grains,

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 they've been breeding to have more gluten in the grains.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 At one point I worked for General Mills in Minneapolis and I learned a lot about it from that point of view.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 It makes the breads and the pizza and dough and all that stick together better,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 but I think the doctor knows what I mean when I'm talking about those lectins or lectins,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 which are a plant protein which protect the seed of the plant.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 They're a sticky protein and make up part of the plant's natural immune system,

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 but when you have a high amount of these lectins, and they're in a lot of the foods,

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 not just wheat but all sorts of stuff, beans, dairy, eggs,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 and when you eat these lectin-containing foods your body can't digest or eliminate those proteins,

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 but you see in the plant world these lectins protect the plant from harm.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 For instance, the pumpkin seed is surrounded by this sticky protein, these lectins,

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 and they fight off enemy invaders, mold, parasites, and so on,

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 but when they get in your body they don't know they're in your body,

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 and they travel through your digestive tract, get into your bloodstream, and they're looking for a fight,

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 because by nature they're designed to attach themselves to sugar molecules.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 They were former plant protectors, and now they're in your body,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 and they're raising a lot of problems,

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 because you've got sugar molecules that are healthy in your cells and your digestive tract and everything,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 and they're attacking that, and that's why there's so much problem with people having digestive problems,

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 and they're allergic to the modern agribusiness wheat.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 So, the problems with plants are forced by agricultural chemicals?

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 Well, there's that too, and stuff, unless you can get some organic grains.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 But anyway, there is a way.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 I'm taking something which contains sacrificial sugars,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 which are decoys that attach to the lectins,

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 and so your cellular sugars are protected.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
 That's working out for me.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 I just came onto that this last year,

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 and I'm not having the inflammation and problems in my digestive system that I used to have.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 I wondered if the doc could address that a little more articulately than I can.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 There are a lot of defensive chemicals, many different kinds.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 For example, bananas are extremely allergenic,

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 probably because of their intensive production in poor soils that they're overproducing,

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 according to the plant's own preference,

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 and so the plant produces more defensive chemicals.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 Even the polyunsaturated fats in seeds are known to have a specific effect against digestive enzymes

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 and add to the absorption of the lectins and more specific immune-disrupting chemicals.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 Ordinary sugars, sucrose, for example, has a tremendously protective effect

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 in resisting all of these inflammation-producing factors,

00:49:51.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 from polyunsaturated fats to the allergens and gluten-type chemicals.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 Fructose catalyzes the ability to use glucose efficiently,

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 and so sucrose is better than even well-cooked starch at protecting the immune system

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 from these irritants and toxins.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 So are you still there, Collar?

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 Okay.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
 So I hope that answered his question.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:37.000
 I think he's taking a supplement of some type of sugar that is helping to block the lectins,

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 so I guess that explains that.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 And we did have a caller who called in to say that swing sets for adults were their health tip for the evening.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 Yes, well, stress, going back to the stress, a way to block stress and how that affects your health so positively.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 Was that the end of the callers?

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 Dr. Peat, stress, that's probably a good point to pick up on.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 In terms of what stress does to people physiologically,

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 would you let people know how it's affecting them badly?

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 People always talk about stress being bad for you, but there's a very good reason.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 Yes, the only mistake that I think Hans Stelje made in all of his work on stress,

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:28.000
 he in some places talked about a limited ability to adapt to stress

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 because we are born with a certain amount of adaptive energy or stress-resistant energy,

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 but I don't think there is such a thing as adaptive energy.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 I think it's such things as sugar, sucrose and fructose, which let us deal with these menacing things such as serotonin,

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 starches, indigestible fibers, various plant irritants.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 The sugars are directly oxidized to energy and inhibit the interfering substances such as oxidizing unsaturated fats.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 I think what the equivalent of a lack of adaptive energy that Stelje proposed,

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:33.000
 I think what it is is that we have such a bad environment to adapt to,

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 that we get worse as we adapt to bad things such as polyunsaturated fats

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 and chronic excess of serotonin defending us against those chronic irritants.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 So I think these immediate adaptive substances that in the short range protect us

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 when we have to keep adapting with these short range measures that, for example,

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 serotonin increases collagen production, leads progressively to fibrosis of blood vessels, liver, kidneys,

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 even the brain develops collagen under excessive stress and serotonin.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 And so too much adaptation to a bad environment, I think,

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 is what causes aging and degeneration rather than the lack of this hypothetical adaptive energy.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 So the immediate response of serotonin to give somebody when they're stressed either constipation or diarrhea,

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 well, that's one way of short term possibly helping if it's helping clean out the bowel with diarrhea.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:02.000
 In the long range, constant exposure to the stress is what causes all these degenerative diseases you just mentioned.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 Yeah, and a high calcium diet and plenty of sugar and reducing those things that support bacterial growth

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:16.000
 will keep your thyroid working and keep your carbon dioxide up.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 Carbon dioxide keeps the serotonin bound and out of trouble.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 And so when you're stressed and make lactic acid, that displaces the carbon dioxide and activates the release of serotonin.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 And when you're stressed, you hyperventilate more easily and then you blow off more CO2.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 So you even have less protection.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 OK, I know. I know. I don't mean to cut you short, Dr. Peter.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 I know there's one more caller who wants to get his question in.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 And I know we've got six, five and a half minutes here before we're off the air.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 And I want to make sure that I get enough time to let people know where they can find out more information about you.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 So let's take the next caller and let's try to keep this down to about three and a half minutes or four minutes at the most.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 You're on the air.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 Hello. Yeah, you know, my first depression hit in 1964.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 And I didn't know anything about depression back then.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 They put me on Elevil, which didn't do a thing.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 And then we tried megavitamin therapy and that did nothing either.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 And this happened six months after I took some very potent Sandos LSD.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 And a lot of it was just the shock of realizing that everything in my life was false.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 And subsequently I went through a divorce and terminated my employment.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 I stood up with my family. A lot of trauma.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 And if people haven't experienced a major depression, they just can't understand.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 I'm balanced now. I'm taking the vaccine.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 And that presents problems because I have prostatitis and that irritates the prostate.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:03.000
 So I'm also taking -- oh, I think it's an alpha blocker.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 It helps deal with that.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
 The biggest -- I'm going to try to make it fast.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000
 The biggest problem in dealing with depression is the whole stigma of it.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 I've noticed not very many people have called up and expressed what they're going through with depression.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 And it's got to change because it is just rampant.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 A lot of it is stress-induced.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 I know that mine used to be called chemical depression and now it's called reactive depression.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 And all the chemicals you're talking about, I deal with those.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 One thing I really wanted to throw out there was early childhood trauma.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 And one of the things I went through was I took these -- they're called gas treatments.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000
 You probably haven't heard of them.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 And they need to be brought back again.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 And what you do, you'll get the value of it.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.000
 But it starts off breathing some nitrous oxide enough to put you into a bit of a hypnotic state.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 And I don't think the doctor realized the full implications of what was going on.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 But then they'd switch it to a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.000
 So that would kick off the medulla thinking you're suffocating and you would hyperventilate.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 You would not only hyperventilate a lot of carbon dioxide but a lot of oxygen.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
 And I've got to tell you, it would take you out there.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000
 I mean, it was a real trip, a trip to hell for me.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 You need to bring your question to a very close point because we need to --

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 Okay.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 Okay.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 Yeah, balance is everything.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 And I think that a lot of that comes through sharing.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 And I've been in therapy for years.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 And I'm very happy with myself.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 So I'm just going to hang up and listen to what -- I've had a heart attack.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 You have to put your ears right into it.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 And --

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 Okay, we're going to have to leave it there, I'm afraid,

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 because we just don't have enough time.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
 It's 7.57.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 We've got a couple of minutes to hear from Dr. Peat and also to give out his information.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000
 So, Dr. Peat, thank you again very much for joining us this evening.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:15.000
 I don't think we've even got time to ask you for your views on that last caller.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.000
 I'm afraid that was probably a little bit too broad a subject to wrap up in a couple of minutes.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 But for those people that have been listening to Dr. Peat this evening,

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:31.000
 he can be found at www.raypeat.com.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000
 On his website, there's a lot of research information and articles.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000
 And that's spelled R-A-Y-P-E-A-T --

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 Dot com.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000
 Dot com.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:51.000
 Okay, and you can also contact us during business hours, Monday through Friday, at 1-888-WBM-ERB.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 We can be reached and obviously can consult via Dr. Peat.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000
 So, Dr. Peat, thank you so much for joining us again.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.000
 And I know that the people who have called and have heard you have certainly benefited.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
 And just once again, thank you so much.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.000
 Thank you.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.000
 All the listeners, thank you for your calls, and we really appreciate your support.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000
 Yeah, and it's Midsummer's Day on Tuesday, folks.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000
 So, enjoy the fact that the days are still getting longer,

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000
 because in a few days, they'll be getting shorter.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
 Okay, thank you so much.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:32.000
