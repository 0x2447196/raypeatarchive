WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 Sounds like we got a glitch on the disc.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.800
 I have to look at that for next month, otherwise we're going to hear that again.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.700
 Okay, so welcome to this evening's Ask Your Ab Doctor.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.700
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.400
 My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.800
 For those of you who perhaps have listened to the show, which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.000
 we're both licensed naturopathic doctors who were educated in England and came to California,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.800
 where the land of the free, home of the brave, we practice herbal medicine and nutritional counseling,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 have a clinic in Garboville.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.200
 Actually, you know what? We don't have a clinic in Garboville.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.600
 That was closed last month, so it was taken over and I'm actually doing a lot more consulting from home,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.800
 so it's actually working out a lot better for most people.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:54.000
 Anyway, the number, if you live here, for the call-in from 7.30 until 8 o'clock is 923-3911.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.600
 We get a lot of people calling from all over the States most shows, so there's an 800 number.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 It's 800-568-3723.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.000
 You can listen to us on the web, KMED.org, and there's a new temporary call-in number.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.600
 So I'm not too sure if that 923-3911 is still active or not. It's not, is it?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.000
 Well, maybe not. Okay.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.200
 Well, folks, there's another temporary call-in number if you're in the 707 area code.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.000
 That's 383-9007.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.600
 So for people that are listening to the show, calls are welcome from 7.30 to 8 p.m.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.200
 If people want to contact us outside of the show, Monday through Friday,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.000
 either go call us on toll-free number 1-888-WBM-ERB,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.200
 or if you want to email either of us, Andrew or Sarah, either Andrew or Sarah,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.800
 at westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.400
 If you want to shoot us questions and stuff like that, we've got the time and we'll certainly answer you.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.800
 Okay. So this month, I wanted to continue from last month's topic

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.800
 because we barely had time to get into the meat of it.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.600
 And last month's topic was a subject, the precautionary principle,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:17.600
 and this is something that Dr. Peat was enlightening me to in terms of what I found out to be a directive in law

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.800
 in Europe, whereas that directive is not in place in the States.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.600
 And there's certainly political and economic reasons for it,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:36.800
 but some of the topics that we'll bring out later on in the show will be pertinent to the fact that in this country,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.600
 it's not enshrined in law, but in the European Union, it is.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.000
 So reiterate the opening of last month's discussion.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 As I said, the precautionary principle as applied to medicines and foods can be seen in Europe,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.400
 where it's codified into law, but purposely not here in the US.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.000
 And whilst this is not a political show, but rather a humanitarian and altruistic venture,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.600
 the politics of nations with their attendant controlling vested interests and lobbyists,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.200
 they most definitely are up for examination.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.600
 A regular phrase which bears worthy cautionary advice is, "If you want to know more, follow the money,"

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.000
 and we've all heard that.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.800
 As I stated last month, the World Charter for Nature, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1982,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.600
 was the first international endorsement of the precautionary principle,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.000
 and the principle was implemented in an international treaty as early as the '87 Montreal Protocol,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 and among other international treaties and declarations, is reflected in the '92 Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.600
 This was signed at the UN Conference on Environment and Development.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.200
 Now, the United States has opposed the use of the term "principle" because this term has special connotations in legal language,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.000
 due to the fact that a principle of law is a source of law.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 And this is the legal status of the precautionary principle in the European Union, though,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.400
 and whilst I'm not a supporter of the Union due to its unelected bureaucracy,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.200
 there's nothing wrong with international dialogue and trade,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:14.200
 with countries agreeing with one another on creative policies whilst retaining their own unique cultures, language, and borders,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.200
 and ultimately learning from mistakes and moving forward with better models.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.000
 Later in the show here, I wanted to explore the nature of both Chris Busby's article,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 and a recent article was shown from Dr. Ernest J. Sternglass,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.400
 and the relation to the whistleblowing on the dangers of the nuclear industry and the government control of data and disinformation.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.800
 I know in the election cycle that we've just gone through, the mainstream media certainly had a lot to say about disinformation,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:52.200
 and there was quite a war waged by both sides in terms of disinformation, or "information," so we're all familiar with that term.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:59.200
 So as I mentioned last month, Chris Busby's article and the invocation in Europe of the Euratom Suicide Clause,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.200
 which we'll talk about later, needs to be closely followed, as there are legal ramifications in Europe

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.600
 which can force the hand of willfully corrupt officials and institutions,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.200
 and this is in regard to accurate reporting on radiation leakage, etc., from these power stations.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:22.200
 On a side note, I am pleased to hear that clean, coal-burning, zero-emission power stations are going to be supported once more,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.200
 and that energy independence and lower energy costs can be a reality for us here in the US.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:36.200
 We've previously discussed the disinformation surrounding the lie of global warming and the real reason it was being pushed globally as carbon taxation,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:42.200
 designed to enslave us all with another "life tax," just like the lie that with Obamacare you can keep your doctor

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.200
 and there's no penalty for not getting health insurance.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:53.200
 Anyway, so Chris Busby's invocation of the Euratom Suicide Clause looks to pose a credible threat to the nuclear industry,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.200
 and Dr. Sternglass's publications clearly show the reality that no radiation exposure is safe.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.200
 So, Dr. Peat, are you with us?

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.200
 Yes.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.200
 And thanks so much for giving your time, as you have been doing for some time now, every third Friday of the month.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.200
 We really appreciate you being here.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:20.200
 So in terms of this precautionary principle, just to briefly wrap from last month so we can continue with the other topics of Sternglass's publication,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:28.200
 Busby's publication, and then get into some of the issues surrounding things like GMO and nanotech,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.200
 as how safe are they and how they've gotten to where they've got.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:40.200
 Could you briefly go through the process again of the precautionary principle, how it applies,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:47.200
 and then that will help people understand perhaps how in Europe, where it doesn't apply, how things have maybe been managed differently,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:57.200
 and then we can look at the bureaucracy and the economic and political involvement or interests that stand to be gained from these people.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:10.200
 The principle really is nothing but saying that common sense should be incorporated into public policy, that it's better to be safe than sorry.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:30.200
 But it's really hard to appreciate why that is so controversial, that you should know something about the probable effects of any action you take.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:41.200
 I was just reading about the first big hydrogen bomb test that the US made in the Pacific.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:48.200
 The very first atomic bomb explosion, some of the people, some of the physicists working on it,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:59.200
 had said that they had calculated there was a certain probability that the bomb might start a chain reaction in the atmosphere and destroy the world.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.200
 They went ahead with it because they said that was a small probability.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.200
 That was pretty good to put it out there.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:21.200
 When they were designing the first hydrogen bomb, to make a portable device, instead of having refrigerated hydrogen gas,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:35.200
 they used lithium hydride or lithium deuteride as the source of the fusible deuterium.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:47.200
 They were calculating that they would get a five megaton explosion from the amount of deuterium present in the lithium compound.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:58.200
 It didn't occur to them that the lithium itself might undergo fission and provide more fusible material.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.200
 In fact, that's what happened.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:13.200
 The lithium itself entered into the nuclear reaction and produced a 15 megaton explosion, three times bigger than they calculated.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:26.200
 It killed a fisherman, irradiated, sickened people on the Japanese fishing boat,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:33.200
 and burned a lot of the sailors and military people who were watching it.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:43.200
 Just because they were so confident that they were good engineers and good physicists,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:50.200
 they didn't even think about the simple physical chemistry involved.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:10:02.200
 That whole process of simple ignorance is something that you have to take into account when you're working with anything dangerous.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:08.200
 But far beyond that is the ulterior motive.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:21.200
 If they have some big goal that they're after, it isn't simply a matter of not investigating the dangers,

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:29.200
 but of actually falsifying the known effects, the known probable effects.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:36.200
 That's where the precautionary principle opens up something much bigger.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:46.200
 The fact that the government has controlled scientific information so drastically over the last 60 or 70 years,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:55.200
 that even if you do try to apply the precautionary principle without the information you need,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:02.200
 it's impossible to take precautions that will save lives in the future.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:10.200
 Okay, now are you saying because in the States here this precautionary principle does not apply,

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:17.200
 that it certainly gives a wider doorway through which this kind of procedure can get through,

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:25.200
 rather than being held accountable financially for reparation through the courts?

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.200
 Yeah, that is one possible solution to it.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:41.200
 If the information ever comes out that they really knew that they were killing people, then they could be held responsible.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:50.200
 Because I guess we're skipping ahead a little bit when I think about vaccine damaged children as a pretty recent revelation.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:57.200
 You know, and Dr. Andrew Wakefield being exonerated and it being brought to full public attention

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:02.200
 that vaccines really have damaged a lot of children.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:07.200
 Well, that's direct. I mean, that's the government directly giving the indemnity.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:14.200
 Yeah, no, I'm just saying where that kind of thing has existed in this country,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:22.200
 there isn't any real, there isn't the same simplistic recourse through law for reparation like there would be in Europe,

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.200
 for example, where they apply the precautionary principle in law.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:34.200
 But documents have come out that the insiders in the Center for Disease Control knew the dangers

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.200
 and didn't want to make public.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:45.200
 Right. Yeah. Okay, so that's very different. That's willful or culpable damage or involvement then.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.200
 And what are you referring to that the CDC did?

00:12:49.200 --> 00:13:01.200
 The insiders knew the research showing the risks of vaccinations as they knew the risks of radiation,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:11.200
 not just risk, the actual cause of cancer, premature birth, brain damage.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:17.200
 When they are finally forced to admit that there is some damage,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:30.200
 they traditionally have falsified the quantities of toxins or the intensity of the damage to be expected.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:41.200
 In the story that Chris Busby is telling, the government falsified the Hiroshima, Nagasaki damage,

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:50.200
 over a hundredfold shrinkage of the actual damage produced over the years.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:56.200
 So is this because the corporations are lobbying the government?

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:01.200
 Well, or owning the government. The lobbying reaches the point where they don't.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:07.200
 It's not just lobbying. They actually own it. Yeah. And so then they get to make up the rules.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:16.200
 Yeah. The people working for the government are assured that if they do favors for the industry,

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:22.200
 they can quit their job in a few years and go to work for the corporations for 10 times as much money.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:28.200
 So it's slightly delayed bribery. Right. Internal gratification.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.200
 All right. So in terms of exploring this precautionary principle,

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:40.200
 how do you think we can develop a safe innovations and without stifling progress

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.200
 or bring to market new ideas in a timely fashion without overregulation or bureaucracy,

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:54.200
 which is another factor that I believe this incoming administration has made a campaign point of stating.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:15:03.200
 He wants to reduce regulations, wants to reduce paperwork, wants to make it easier to bring products to market.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.200
 So what's the best way forward with this?

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:13.200
 Just imagining that he does not want to do anything that is dangerous and that he's not in it for money.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:20.200
 With his kind of ethos, how does this play out safely?

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:26.200
 Information has to be available to the public.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:35.200
 And that involves alternative scientific opinion being publishable.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:43.200
 But when the journals are controlled by the industry, the what's available, for example,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:49.200
 the interference by Monsanto with articles that have been critical,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:57.200
 either stopping their publication or pressuring for the elimination,

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:04.200
 the retraction of already published articles. And in the case of health physics and radiation,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:14.200
 the main journal, Journal of Health Physics, is really a house organ of the nuclear industry.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:21.200
 The articles that are published are just outrageously favorable radiation,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.200
 claiming that it's actually good for people to be irradiated.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.200
 So there's a lot of collusion basically between the industry and government.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.200
 And science.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.200
 And science, yeah.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.200
 It's all a ruse.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.200
 Because a lot of the, and we've mentioned this many times about clinical trials being skewed,

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.200
 data being hidden, and then they brought out last month, didn't they,

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:48.200
 that Glaxo's kind of record settlement of three billion in compensation

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.200
 as a relatively small part of their income.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:17:00.200
 And so it's really not in the interests of these companies to be so prudent

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:10.200
 because either the reparation is not high in contrast to the gross income of the business

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.200
 compared to what it would be if they had to make it safe and/or not produce it.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:21.200
 And then there's all the lobbying that goes on between government and big corporations

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.200
 that, like you said, is very much an inside job.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:30.200
 And if there isn't any truth in publication or a movement to provide the truth,

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.200
 and again, we have said this many times, that the Internet, I believe,

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:40.200
 is really making a difference to the world population's perception of what is true

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.200
 because there is plenty of information you can find in any argument.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.200
 And ultimately, you know what, you begin to see what is the truthful side of what you might read.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.200
 Well, that's getting changed too.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.200
 I mean you try to find something on YouTube and you can hardly find it

00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:00.200
 because there are advertising sites that try to tell you what they want to tell you

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.200
 or show you the part of the show they want you to see, not the whole thing.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.200
 It's very much like what you said, and you have said it quite a few times in different parts of the show,

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.200
 when you used to read abstracts in the library of original research,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.200
 it was all well and good because it was original research and there it was,

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.200
 but they started removing it from the libraries.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.200
 And now you have a hard time finding it on a web search

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.200
 because those abstracts either haven't been reproduced or what you might find now,

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:33.200
 you're being directed to by certain algorithms that are now becoming fairly commonplace

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.200
 within Google's search terms or as we've heard about Facebook censoring now

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:44.200
 and they're using fairly complicated algorithms to produce the results they want.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:54.200
 Everyone seems to trust PubMed, but years ago the librarian posted a notice for students

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.200
 to be aware that PubMed is not a science database.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:03.200
 Meaning it's controlled by industry?

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.200
 Yes, it's an industry database.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.200
 It's a government, military.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:17.200
 I compared some articles that were listed in biological abstracts or chemical abstracts

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.200
 and then looked them up in the index Medicus or PubMed

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.200
 and the good articles were simply deleted.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:37.200
 I would find a conventional mainstream idea article right next to it, a very good article.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:42.200
 The bad article would be listed in PubMed, the good article wouldn't be.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.200
 Now you said biological abstracts and the other one that you mentioned?

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.200
 Chemical abstracts.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.200
 Chemical abstracts.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.200
 So these are both searchable databases that anyone can look at now if they want to.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.200
 They're very expensive to use.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.200
 Are they a pay per publication type subscription?

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.200
 You can't subscribe and then have access to the library?

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:11.200
 If you get your library to subscribe and then are a member of the library, a staff or student,

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.200
 that's the only practical way to get in.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.200
 And the library is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, aren't they?

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.200
 Shame.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.200
 Okay, well you're listening to Ask Herb Doctor on KMED Galbraithville 91.1 FM

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.200
 from 7.30 to the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.200
 You're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.200
 to this month's continuing subject of the precautionary principle in food and medicine.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:42.200
 The number if you live in the area, there's a temporary call-in number, 707-383-9007.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:51.200
 Or if you're outside the 707 number, there's an 800 number which is 1-800-568-3723.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:21:00.200
 So Dr. Peat, in terms of the-- I'm trying to think what is the best way of making this crooked road straight again

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.200
 in terms of-- it's always a case of just follow the money.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.200
 If you want to know where something is going, follow the money because that's the only thing

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:12.200
 that people are ever really pursuing in business is the financial gain

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:19.200
 unless obviously they are PhD students who are doing theses and doing research

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.200
 that's hopefully not being tampered with or they're not being steered in a certain direction.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:29.200
 Well, abstract should have-- I mean, fully referenced scientific publications should have the funding

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.200
 listed at the bottom and that gives you a cue to follow the money.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:42.200
 So what would be the best way in terms of getting a system in place where we could free up the bureaucracy

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.200
 and the paperwork which is so apparent in Europe and the European Union?

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:52.200
 It's a complete mess and very difficult to do anything because of the bureaucratic nightmare of legislation.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:22:03.200
 How do we get by the safety aspects of anything that is either food or medicine or devices that people use

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:12.200
 so that there can be a freely true open market and bringing product to market in a good time

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:21.200
 and having a mechanism in place where there is a disincentive to be dishonest and/or dangerous?

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:42.200
 Even though it would be nice to be able to use the courts and to have Congress enforce open information laws,

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:54.200
 in what they release under the Freedom of Information Act, if anyone has had an experience with trying to get information

00:22:54.200 --> 00:23:05.200
 out of the FDA, for example, they first stall and then they censor what they send you,

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:14.200
 blocking out the essential parts or just saying that the information is no longer available.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:24.200
 It would be nice if Congress could actually create a freedom of information that worked,

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:36.200
 but since that's fairly well proven not to work, I think it has to be something parallel.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:45.200
 Using the internet for communication, for example, I think people have to create alternative institutions

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:59.200
 to sort of like WikiLeaks of science and consumer information, in which information that is more likely to be factual

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.200
 is made available to the general public.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:09.200
 It makes me think about the First Amendment and the Freedom of Speech Association

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:16.200
 and how glaringly obviously important that is in terms of having a society that is not afraid to speak out.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:22.200
 That obviously is something that is so suppressed in China, probably still in parts of Russia,

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:28.200
 and other stroke communist, stroke socialist dictatorships or tyrannies.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:33.200
 When people feel that there is nothing to be lost by being truthful,

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.200
 then amongst the people the decision can be arrived that we don't want this anymore,

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:44.200
 this is not good, we don't agree with it, and that should bear out in a government response

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:49.200
 as a government is for the people, by the people, right, not to be telling the people what to do,

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.200
 but actually working for the people.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:58.200
 So I think the whole dishonesty side of most of what goes on or can go on,

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:03.200
 I don't want to paint everybody with the same brush, but just to say that money totally is,

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.200
 truly the root or the love of money is totally the root of all evil.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:15.200
 If there was more honesty and transparency that would itself cause more trustworthy business

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:24.200
 and more products that were for our good, that didn't have the same propensity to be dangerous.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:32.200
 So getting on to both these two articles, one is Chris Busby's Euratom Clause.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:38.200
 I just wanted to mention this is an excellent full report outlining the cover-up

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:44.200
 and the misinformation tactics used by government to hide the fact that the death of survivors

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:49.200
 of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is still ongoing and killing tens of thousands every year

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.200
 through cancers and genetic defects directly caused by radiation exposure

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:59.200
 and how this massive cover-up was done by the US government of all things

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:05.200
 in order to keep and maintain the illusion that nuclear weapons were a good thing

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.200
 and that we could use them tactically, wasn't a problem, but it was a very quick way

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:16.200
 to really bring a rapid close to a conflict because of its devastating effects

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:22.200
 when actually the truth behind that is so completely polar opposite.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:29.200
 And then another publication by Dr. Ernest Sternglass, his work on no exposure

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.200
 as the only safe approach to radiation.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.200
 For our listeners, his work can be seen by typing the search term

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.200
 "Nuclear Witness Dr. Ernest J. Sternglass"

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:56.200
 and you'll get a full list of publications at http://radiation.org/reading/ajsternglasspubs.html

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:03.200
 So I wanted just to bring out a couple of things that are just obviously out there

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:07.200
 as part and parcel of factual reporting.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.200
 The UPI has stated now there's skyrocketing cancer cases in Fukushima.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:17.200
 Associated Press have come out with an article alarming cancer rates after nuclear disaster.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.200
 The Times has published child cancers up 5000% in Fukushima

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.200
 and then radiation doses may be considerably higher than estimated.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:31.200
 Another thing closer to home here, before we get into some more of the things

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.200
 that you might want to bring out about Sternglass,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.200
 I know there was an interesting part of his history there where there was an interesting discussion here

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.200
 with Albert Einstein as part of the article.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.200
 But the spike in animal deformities on the West Coast soon after Fukushima

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.200
 and then hundreds of baby cows with distorted legs and other malformations.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:55.200
 And just in February 2017 here, dead whales with a record high number of deaths in Hawaii

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.200
 and carcasses scattered throughout the islands in the Pacific

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.200
 with sick and starving animals a mystery to experts.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:07.200
 Possible health effects in parentheses from Fukushima radiation off the coast blamed.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:12.200
 And then also Fukushima's environmental catastrophe has only just begun

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.200
 with a massive increase in radiation being continually leaked into the Pacific

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:20.200
 being disclosed by TEPCO surprisingly in the last month.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:26.200
 So in terms of the nuclear industry and the precautionary principle,

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:31.200
 I think Busby's got it right if he can get this to court safely

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:36.200
 and/or the European Union doesn't just dissolve like it sure looks like it's going to dissolve

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.200
 sometime soon here.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:46.200
 How on earth can we really continue to defend nuclear energy

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:52.200
 in the presence of technologies like clean coal that were being rapidly shut down

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:57.200
 and made far too expensive to operate by the Obama administration

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.200
 in the light of it being a global warming issue

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.200
 when actually global warming is a huge misinformation campaign

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:10.200
 all based on carbon taxation as a form of lifelong taxation?

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:16.200
 Do you remember when the Three Mile Island reactor melted down?

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:21.200
 The public really started turning against nuclear energy

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:26.200
 because of the fear of a huge meltdown.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:31.200
 Sternglass got in great trouble.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:38.200
 The industry defamed him beginning even before that around 1970.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:43.200
 They started saying he was totally uninformed and so on

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:49.200
 because he had the actual inside information showing that the government

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:58.200
 was underestimating, under-declaring the amount of radiation being released

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.200
 by hundreds of millions of times.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:12.200
 Actually, more than a million times more was being released than the government claimed or admitted.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:20.200
 And the nuclear industry, professionally, they taught everyone who worked in the nuclear industry

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:30.200
 that people like Sternglass and Goffman and Alice Stewart were simply incompetent.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.200
 Even Linus Pauling was in trouble.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:40.200
 He couldn't do the normal professional things because he was ostracized

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:50.200
 by other chemists and physicists because of his opposition to testing bombs in the atmosphere and so on.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:59.200
 Part of the article of Sternglass is they mentioned the US Army's readiness

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:07.200
 to commit all of these underground explosions, and they were going to do hundreds of them,

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.200
 to create caverns in which they could store natural gas.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.200
 And they started that. I think they did one.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:19.200
 And the fallout from this was so great and the contamination was so great

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.200
 that it unfortunately couldn't be covered up.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.200
 And I know they kind of had to stop that being pushed forward,

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:32.200
 but they were fully ready to commit hundreds of nuclear explosions

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:37.200
 to this one project up on the East Coast.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:47.200
 That whole idea of atoms for peace, such as digging canals and producing natural gas release and so on,

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.200
 all of that was knowingly fraudulent.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:55.200
 It wasn't just a failure to observe the precautionary principle.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:07.200
 They knew they had the information right from the 1940s that small amounts of radiation caused infant deformities,

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:14.200
 stopped brain growth in the utero, caused birth defects of a great variety,

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.200
 but especially brain damage.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:28.200
 They knew what it would do, but for their own purposes to be able to wage nuclear war,

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:35.200
 they promoted this idea that the bombs had a peaceful use,

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:41.200
 and that extended to the idea of producing cheap power

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:47.200
 without counting the cost of mining the uranium and processing it

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:58.200
 and killing the miners by breathing the radon and ingesting uranium and so on.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:10.200
 The military created a myth of free energy and peaceful uses of the bombs.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:19.200
 Because of the public turning against nuclear power in 1978 as a result of Three Mile Island,

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:26.200
 a process started in the Pentagon in which they had to revise,

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:32.200
 come out with something more scary than nuclear power.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:41.200
 Just at the beginning of 1980, just a few months after Three Mile Island,

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:49.200
 they reversed a trend of predicting a new ice age,

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:56.200
 which had been the data from the late 1940s until 1979.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.200
 They were predicting planetary cooling.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:08.200
 But the Pentagon and the CIA came up with this idea of planetary warming a few months after the Three Mile Island.

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:12.200
 The nuclear power industry told them to do that, right?

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:21.200
 Yeah. Well, the military too, because they need the nuclear power as a source of fuel for the bombs.

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:31.200
 And so they invented planetary warming, totally reversing the preceding 30 years of climate study

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:36.200
 as a way to say there's something worse than nuclear power.

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:45.200
 If we don't use this clean, cheap energy, nuclear power will overheat the planet.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.200
 And polar bears will die.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:54.200
 And we won't take into consideration how many women, children and men die from radiation poisoning.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:35:03.200
 Yeah. And then when Chernobyl exploded and the nuclear industry in this country,

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:11.200
 ever since then, 1986 to the present, have insisted that only a few dozen people were killed

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.200
 as a result of the Chernobyl meltdown.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:25.200
 And the Russians who were best informed on the whole process of Chernobyl and the cleanup

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:32.200
 calculated that when they did the study, it's been about 10 years now, I think,

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:43.200
 up until that point, 985,000 premature deaths from cancer had already occurred from Chernobyl alone.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:49.200
 And cancer is only one of the causes of death from radiation.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:59.200
 So if you have a million people versus 30 deaths from the U.S. industry's perspective,

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:06.200
 that's again a hundred thousand fold difference.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:13.200
 Well, again, I just want to say that it's very obvious to me, I mean, I'm only 51,

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:21.200
 so I haven't been around that long, but it's very obvious to me that there are cyclic events that happen.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:30.200
 And I think it's analogous to the polyunsaturated fats that we first met you and talked to you with in 2007,

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:38.200
 that you were espousing polyunsaturated as really very bad, very damaging, very oxidizable,

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:43.200
 lipofuscin being a problem, thyroid suppression being a problem.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.200
 And you've been saying that for a long time, you know, probably two or three decades.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:56.200
 And only just maybe in the last year or two years has that revelation become a little bit more mainstream.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:07.200
 Actually, my interest in that grew out of my interest in the radiation industry issue in the 1950s,

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:19.200
 because those are the fats that most break down and become toxic under the influence of radiation.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:28.200
 And excess of polyunsaturated fats produces the same kind of damage that radiation injury does.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:37.200
 And my interest in estrogen relates to that, because estrogen and ionizing radiation synergize.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:42.200
 Each one produces the same sort of damage to the organism.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:48.200
 And both of those converge on the polyunsaturated fats in the tissues.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:38:00.200
 So really, the government has participated in obscuring simple biological or chemical processes in the organism,

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:08.200
 because each one impinges on some ulterior motive that the government and industry has.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.200
 Absolutely good.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:14.200
 Well, we have a couple of callers, but I just wanted to finish up by saying that that is coming around full circle now,

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:18.200
 where we see saturated fats being portrayed as actually very useful now,

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.200
 and polyunsaturated fats now being maligned the way it should have been.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.200
 And we're talking about radiation now.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:30.200
 We've done quite a few shows on radiation damage, and it's just up to people to be able to hear this,

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:36.200
 and get it into their minds, get it into their consciousness that we are the people, our voices do matter.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.200
 All we have to do is just stand up and just say, "We don't want this."

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.200
 There are other alternatives that are much better and much safer,

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.200
 but it takes a free society to do that.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:52.200
 You're not going to get that in communist China or countries that are controlled by their governments, right?

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.200
 That's what a free and open society is all about,

00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:03.200
 where our voices are what direct the government to put things into place.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.200
 Anyway, we have a couple of callers, so let's take this first caller.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.200
 And caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.200
 Hi, Cora, are you there?

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.200
 Is this me?

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.200
 Yes.

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.200
 Hi, I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area,

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:23.200
 and I found that as my hypothyroidism and estrogen dominance improves,

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.200
 things are less and less overwhelming.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:30.200
 For example, I used to get anxious and overwhelmed with simple tasks like grocery shopping,

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:35.200
 and recently someone told me that I was using my health issues as an excuse for laziness.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.200
 And so I was wondering, what are your thoughts on the concept of laziness?

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:44.200
 Interestingly, I'm the most productive when I feel very healthy, like when I eat well, sleep well, et cetera.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.200
 Absolutely.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.200
 Dr. Peat, would you like to answer that question?

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.200
 As an excuse for what?

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.200
 Laziness.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:40:00.200
 Yeah, people, blaming people, saying, oh, you're just using your health problems as an excuse to be lazy and not work.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:15.200
 I don't think I've ever run into anyone that had exactly that excuse.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:20.200
 Well, I think what the caller was trying to put through was --

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:25.200
 the way I interpret it straightaway was that when you are metabolically deficient,

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.200
 it has a psychological effect, and I think it's a very real effect.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:34.200
 And so in terms of improving your metabolic health, everything improves with it.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:43.200
 I think whether it's your thought processes, your recapitulation, or your accuracy and your performance,

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:48.200
 it's a bit like adaptogens, like the Russians did that research on the Lutheran and the ginsengs,

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:54.200
 as cognitive performance or cognitive enhancing products.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:59.200
 No, when you're metabolically healthy, then you're definitely the most productive.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:10.200
 The chronic fatigue syndrome for quite a few years was said to be a personality issue.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.200
 Right, and fibromyalgia, I think they also put that down to --

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:18.200
 But that's something that can actually be measured metabolically and hormonally and such.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.200
 Absolutely.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:24.200
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Urb Doctor on KMED Galbraithville, 91.1 FM.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.200
 From now until the end of the show, 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions related

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:32.200
 or unrelated to this month's subject of the precautionary principle.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.200
 If you live in the area, there's a toll-free number -- sorry, if you live in the area,

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:41.200
 there's a regular number, 707-383-9007.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:47.200
 Or if you're outside the area, there's a toll-free number, 1-800-568-3723.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.200
 So, Dr. Peat, we do have another call on the air.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.200
 Let's take this next caller.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:54.200
 Caller, where are you from, and what's your question?

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.200
 Hello?

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.200
 Engineer, do we have a caller?

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.200
 He might have gotten tired of waiting.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.200
 I don't know.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.200
 We hear him now.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.200
 I think you're on the air now.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:09.200
 Where are you from and what's your question?

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.200
 I did hear someone's voice, but they've gone again.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.200
 Hi.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.200
 I'm interested in two topics, if you have the time.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:28.200
 The first question would be, is there an ideal body fat percentage to aim for?

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.200
 Right.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.200
 And the second question would be related to sleep.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.200
 What do we know?

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:38.200
 What does science tell us about how much sleep we really need?

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:42.200
 Maybe the sleeping positions.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:50.200
 Is it smart to sleep just once at night?

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.200
 Okay.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.200
 Where are you from?

00:42:53.200 --> 00:43:01.200
 The deep sleep, how much time we need in deep sleep and such things.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.200
 Sure.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.200
 Where are you from?

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.200
 From Finland.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.200
 Finland.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.200
 You're calling from Finland now, eh?

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.200
 That's correct.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.200
 It is now 5 a.m.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.200
 And very dark.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.200
 3 a.m.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.200
 And very dark probably.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.200
 Okay.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.200
 Dr. Peat, what's the ideal body fat percentage?

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.200
 I guess that's probably the proportion of the height and everything else.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.200
 And sleep.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.200
 I know you've got a lot to say about how much sleep a person should get,

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:31.200
 but would you start with what you think an ideal body fat percentage should be?

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:36.200
 I think it varies according to gender and age.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:46.200
 For example, young women who are overweight have a better outcome of breast cancer,

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:50.200
 a lower incidence of breast cancer, than those who are underweight.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.200
 And what age are you saying young women?

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.200
 Oh, in the 20s and 30s.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:06.200
 And one of the greatest increases in cancer is occurring among women between the ages of 25

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.200
 and the early 30s.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:15.200
 It's tripled in the last 30 or 40 years in that age group.

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:26.200
 But because of that relationship, it's better for a young woman to be on the plump side.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.200
 With saturated fats, sir.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.200
 Yeah, with a good diet.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:44.200
 And then in older people, being somewhat leaner for women is reducing the risk of breast cancer.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:53.200
 But in old people in general, mortality is lower with heavier body weight.

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.200
 They just have greater resistance to stresses.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:04.200
 So you have to look at the individual and their age and gender.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:14.200
 Overall, mortality goes down in the old people who are slightly on the heavy side.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:20.200
 So it's very much relative to age then and age and gender because obviously that percentage will change then.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:26.200
 I thought you said that older people who are slightly more plump have a decreased mortality.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:37.200
 Yeah, same with increased cholesterol and a slight increase of blood pressure in the old age is good.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:42.200
 What do you think that body fat percentage would be though, 20%, 24%?

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.200
 I think a little higher.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.200
 That's pretty low.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.200
 Okay.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.200
 That's too low, huh?

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:52.200
 I remember when I was 19, I think I had it measured at 19%.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.200
 Okay.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:57.200
 I don't think you'd ever be able to get pregnant at 19%.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.200
 So how about 30%?

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.200
 Yeah, I think 30% is a good average.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.200
 Alright.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.200
 And now how about your recommendations for sleep?

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:09.200
 I know you're a good advocate of getting enough rest.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.200
 The timing also.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.200
 And the quality of the sleep is the thing.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:22.200
 Your blood sugar has to stay fairly steady, not drop too much during the night.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:37.200
 Otherwise, the deep sleep is diminished and the lighter phase of sleep in which you don't really repair your tissues becomes,

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:51.200
 for example, in a low thyroid person, they might spend 8 or 10 hours in bed semi-sleeping but wake up feeling fatigued and stiff and so on.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:47:02.200
 And the level of blood sugar and metabolic rate are the main things that allow the deep and restful sleep.

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:07.200
 The turnover of the brain tissue is very great during the night.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:19.200
 And that's one of the places where polyunsaturated fats in your, for example, your thighs and abdomen, during the night,

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:27.200
 those are released into the bloodstream and whatever is in the bloodstream gets built into the brain structure.

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:35.200
 And you get this terrific turnover constantly during the night of the brain substance.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:43.200
 So you want to keep your free fatty acids fairly low during the night by keeping your blood sugar up.

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:50.200
 And so having carbohydrates close to bedtime protects the quality of sleep.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:48:02.200
 I've studied people with cirrhosis of the liver who did much better on all their tests if they had a fairly big dose of any carbohydrate,

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:07.200
 sugar or rice, for example, at bedtime.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:18.200
 And the breakdown that happens with aging primarily happens during the night, the calcium loss from the bones.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:28.200
 It's essentially all in the morning urine or the night urine because that's when the stress hormones rise and cause the turnover.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:42.200
 So if you can take advantage of that rapid turnover, if your stores of glycogen are high enough to keep the free fatty acids down.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:51.200
 Okay, good. So I think you like to suggest that 10 hours is really not too much sleep.

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:56.200
 No, but you probably don't need that much if it's efficient sleep.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:09.200
 But 10 hours is fine if it's cyclic, if you're going through the deep sleep and then the slight arousal and then back into the deep sleep.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:17.200
 But I think it should be more than six hours for almost everyone.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:28.200
 I think Nicola was thinking about perhaps your comments on the "neanderthal sleep patterns" where we'd actually wake up,

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:33.200
 or maybe not even neanderthal, but maybe not quite so far back in history as that,

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:41.200
 where they say that humans used to go through two or three sleep cycles in a night and that actually was quite normal.

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:47.200
 And actually now what we do, we go to bed at 10 or 11 and we don't wake up to 7, is actually being abnormal.

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:55.200
 Yeah, in the long winter or the night darkness would be stressful.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:50:06.200
 But if they wake up and have a lunch in the middle of the night, that replenishes their glycogen stores and makes the night much less stressful.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.200
 Right, okay. So it's all about how much sugar storage you have.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:14.200
 And you know you're not storing your sugar if you wake up at 3 a.m. and can't go back to sleep.

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.200
 There you go. That's a cue.

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:24.200
 Doctors used to be very negative about night eaters, like it was some kind of abnormality.

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:31.200
 But the studies in the last five years or so show that it's very protective.

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.200
 Excellent.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:36.200
 And haven't you said too, Dr. Peat, that no one should get up before 8 o'clock?

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.200
 I think so.

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.200
 I like to quote that.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:46.200
 If you're in the area, the 707 number, 707-383-9007.

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:51.200
 Or if you want a call toll free, 1-800-568-3723.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.200
 We've got them to the top of the hour here.

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.200
 And I haven't ever met a night worker who is healthy.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:00.200
 But I could still meet one. I'm not saying it's not possible.

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.200
 How about that is the question.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:19.200
 It's a little bit unrelated, but in terms of night shifts and the total imbalance of circadian rhythm and night and day and pineal gland involvement with serotonin and sleep and everything else.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.200
 What do you think about people doing night shifts?

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:28.200
 It's very bad for the health, increases the cancer incidence, for example.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:34.200
 I think it's very important to avoid it when it's possible.

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.200
 Yeah. Okay.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.200
 All right.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.200
 I think we do have somebody calling in here.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:41.200
 So let's just see if this call is actually a call.

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:56.200
 I was going to question a little bit if we didn't get any more calls about clinical trials and how -- because I know that you've certainly got experience with publishing material and the whole clinical trial basis and the mechanisms.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.200
 But anyway, we have a caller here.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.200
 So let's take this next caller.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.200
 Call away from and what's your question?

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.200
 Hi. San Francisco Bay Area.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:07.200
 I just called, but Sarah just mentioned that Dr. Peat said before that you shouldn't wake up after 8.

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.200
 Can you elaborate on that?

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.200
 I've never heard of that before.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.200
 Dr. Peat.

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:14.200
 Or you should wake up after 8, I think.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.200
 Right.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.200
 Yeah, you shouldn't get up before 8 o'clock in the morning.

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:26.200
 And, Dr. Peat, is that because of cortisol levels that are very high at the early hours of the morning and if you try to do much, it's a real strain on your system?

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.200
 Yeah.

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:39.200
 For example, people who would go for a jog first thing in the morning without eating, they looked at their blood cells and their chromosomes in their white blood cells were broken.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:56.200
 And if they ate and then did their run, there was no chromosome damage and that same morning susceptibility to stress shows up in the mortality.

00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:01.200
 There's a morning peak in death from strokes and heart attacks.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:09.200
 The blood is thicker in the morning and the cortisol is at its daytime peak.

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:13.200
 So people are relatively fragile in the morning.

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:17.200
 That's why you don't want to jump in a hot shower first thing in the morning before eating either.

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.200
 Right?

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.200
 Doesn't that lower blood sugar?

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.200
 Yeah.

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.200
 Okay.

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:27.200
 So let me ask you in the six minutes or so that we have until the top of the hour.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:55.200
 About the clinical trials and in terms of published work, I think because like you said, you know, the only real reliable source of information if you can afford it or if you can get a library to join to find real, well I say real, but unbiased publications is the biological abstracts or chemical abstracts.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:54:10.200
 In terms of pharmaceutical companies falsifying data and I know when I've questioned you about various abstracts and you've told me, well, that means this or this means that and otherwise actually not, it's not actually the way to interpret that.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.200
 This is what they're trying to do.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:35.200
 Is there any way, is there any way, any easy way for people to find, I don't know, glaring mistakes in clinical trials or information about clinical trials that will help find more accurate information about it or is it just completely sewn up by the companies doing the trials?

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:50.200
 If you think of propaganda analysis when you're reading a science paper, you have to think about everything that they can do wrong.

00:54:50.200 --> 00:55:07.200
 Sometimes I see a paper with fairly good conclusions in which they did everything wrong, but doing those wrong techniques, it makes it a pretty subjective thing.

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:32.200
 You can come up with almost any conclusion you want if you're using crazy techniques and when you, for example, dissociate brain cells and put them in culture and if you separate mitochondria and do techniques such as the patch clamp recording,

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:49.200
 a special way of recording electrical activity, there are things that have absolutely no physiological real meaning that are very customary in the research papers.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:56:12.200
 So you have to look for connections, how they can connect that to what's happening in the real organism and if you look at studies on animals, they can do things to animals, the intact animal that you can't do to a person and so you can get very good information.

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:30.200
 If you use an animal that's a good model of a person, but if you use, for example, a rodent with its night cycle and forget what time of day you're doing the experiment, they're stressed.

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:44.200
 If they're a nocturnal animal and you do experiments during the daytime when they normally would be sleeping, you have to look at whether the animal is a good model of the person.

00:56:44.200 --> 00:57:10.200
 But typically someone with an ulterior motive will use exactly those tricks of putting an animal in stress and claiming that it's a good model or choosing an animal that has an opposite reaction, for example, to cortisol and estrogen.

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:23.200
 Much of the estrogen industry is based on the claims about the estrogen and bone health based on rodents.

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:30.200
 They have been doing studies in dogs and they found that estrogen damaged their bones.

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:37.200
 They gave up the dog studies and went to rodents because they could get opposite results.

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:43.200
 Let's hold you there, Dr. Peat. I do appreciate you bringing that out, but let me get people your information.

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:53.200
 Well, I just want to say one thing. Well, Dr. Peat, that's why we need you to help us sort out all this information because you have such a long history of looking at it and figuring it out.

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:59.200
 We really need you to help keep helping us, Dr. Peat. So I hope you stay alive for another 30 years.

00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:02.200
 I'm praying.

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.200
 I bet you are. All right. Well, thanks so much for your time, Dr. Peat.

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.200
 Thank you.

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:11.200
 Okay. For those people who've listened to the show, thanks for calling in. It's always good to get callers from other countries.

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:16.200
 Normally, the East Coast is pretty cool and then when we get some of them out of the country, that's great.

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:21.200
 If you want to know more, www.raypeat.com.

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:32.200
 Let me just reiterate the two people that we were studying, Chris Busby, B-U-S-B-Y, URATOM, E-U-R-A-T-O-M, URATOM clause.

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:43.200
 And also do go and have a look at Dr. Ernest Sternglass's work. It's a very interesting section there on Einstein and his meeting with Einstein.

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:48.200
 Anyway, there's the glitch on the CD, folks. So we've got to get that sorted out for next month.

00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.200
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.200
 My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray. Thanks for listening and have a good night.

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.200
 Yeah. Bye-bye.
