00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Welcome to Politics and Science.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.360
 Politics and Science can be heard weekly on WMRW LP1 95.1 FM, airing on Wednesdays at

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.200
 5 p.m. and Sundays at noon.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:23.920
 And in the Bellows Falls area, it can be heard on WULL LP Bellows Falls at 101.1 FM, airing

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.560
 from 3 to 4 p.m. on Sundays and from 9 to 10 a.m. on Mondays.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.340
 Politics and Science presents the viewpoints of its participants and does not necessarily

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.920
 reflect the viewpoints of any other person or organization.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:50.040
 All right, I'm back on the air and I believe I have Dr. Raymond Peat here.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.280
 This is Politics and Science on the 30th of March, 2011.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.200
 And Dr. Ray Peat, can you hear me?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.200
 Yes.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.200
 Oh, good.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.200
 Is there an echo?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.200
 No.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.200
 Okay, great.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.200
 Tell me if it starts happening.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.200
 Okay.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.000
 Dr. Ray Peat is a physiologist and an endocrinologist from Eugene, Oregon, and has a website with

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.720
 a lot of excellent articles on it on a variety of subjects, but mostly about physiology.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.680
 And that can be found at raypeat.com.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.880
 That's R-A-Y-P-E-A-T dot com.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.240
 Ray, thanks so much for coming on Politics and Science again.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.440
 Well, we've talked about radiation before, but I think it was two years ago we had two

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.440
 shows in a row.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.040
 I didn't know it had been that long.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.480
 Yeah, it actually has.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.360
 But in light of the Fukushima power plant, which is in process of melting down as we

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.920
 speak, and probably will be over the next, I don't know how long, they've been unable

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.280
 to get control of it, so it'll probably keep going on for a few months.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.040
 And there is quite a bit of radiation being given off from that plant, although the exact

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.040
 amounts are subject to debate, I understand.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.400
 But in light of that happening, I thought we should revisit radiation and do it in the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.520
 context of your recent very excellent newsletter, which was entitled "Radiation and Growth,"

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.360
 came out this January 2001.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.800
 And if people go to Dr. Peat's website, they can read a lot of those newsletters online.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.160
 And also, I believe you can sign up for the newsletter and get it hot off the press.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.640
 You're publishing that six times a year now, is that right, Dr. Peat?

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.640
 Yeah.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.040
 The reason I wrote that newsletter last fall was two things.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.000
 The transportation safety people, I think the echo is coming back.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:16.680
 The TSA instruments that irradiate people had got my interest up again in radiation.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:25.160
 And then I saw that there were people selling radioactive rocks as therapeutic things, for

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.840
 example, to wear around your neck to cure breast cancer and so on.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:39.880
 And I saw that T.D. Lucky, who is now at least 90 years old, was interviewed by one of these

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:47.000
 rock ladies talking about his radioactive rock that he liked to rub.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.400
 And I saw that since his history for 50 years has been serving the nuclear industry to tell

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:05.440
 people that radiation is good for you rather than harmful, I realized that with Obama and

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:15.880
 his nuclear industry support, that T.D. Lucky and the radioactive rocks were just part of

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:24.400
 a new wave of promotion of radiation security ideas.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.440
 I see.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:34.440
 And T.D. Lucky, I think in this recent newsletter you talked a little bit about how he worked.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.440
 It was interesting.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.280
 So he was a spokesman for the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:50.680
 I heard about his talks when I was talking about Ernest Sternglass and his low-level

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.680
 radiation book, for example.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:01.520
 I talked to people who worked in the nuclear industry, and they said, "Oh, that's rubbish.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.400
 No one should read that stuff.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.520
 It's all phony."

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:16.880
 And I found out that they had been given weekly seminars at the nuclear factory to debunk people

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:26.200
 like Goffman, Pauling, and Sternglass, and T.D. Lucky was one of the regulars at those

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:35.920
 industry seminars to educate the workers that those people were such lunatics and phonies

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:43.120
 that no respectable person should even look at their publications.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:52.880
 And I looked up some of the references that T.D. Lucky cites, and one of them was published

00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:02.760
 in a right-wing crazy medical journal, and others are published in nuclear-supported

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:13.520
 radiation protection journals, basically giving the nuclear industry position and nothing

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.720
 from the real biologists.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.480
 So when people are listening to this information that we're getting from the mainstream press

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.440
 and from other sources, like even this radio station, how are they supposed to ascertain

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.520
 who's got the accurate data and who doesn't?

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:40.760
 Well, if you just read the references cited by T.D. Lucky or any of these people who are

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:49.640
 propagandizing against Pauling and Goffman and Sternglass, and then if you read Sternglass's

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.960
 books, for example, you can judge for yourself.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:05.120
 Sternglass pried some information out of the agencies, although much of it was just completely

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.520
 destroyed and not made available.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:20.800
 But the information that he got was very public, very simple, factual, population information,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.720
 mortality figures and so on.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:38.280
 Everything public and very sound and absolutely in a different world from the political fantasies

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.320
 that the Lucky people fight.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.080
 And this talking about Ernest Sternglass brings us back to some of the history that you cover

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:54.840
 in this newsletter, again entitled "Radiation and Growth, Incoherent Imprinting from Inappropriate

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.840
 Radiation."

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:03.840
 And I guess Ernest Sternglass worked with Linus Pauling, who was famous as a Nobel Prize winner,

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.880
 and they were both working to stop atomic testing.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:14.920
 Can you explain a little bit why they got involved with that issue?

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:28.040
 In the '50s, Linus Pauling was talking about the genetic effects of even one alpha-emitting

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:38.880
 atom ingested into the body, he was saying that alpha particle delivers all of its energy

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.760
 to a very small area.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:49.200
 So if it hits a nucleus, it'll either kill the nucleus or mutate it.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:57.360
 And he said that every mutation ultimately can be considered as a fatality, even if it

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:06.480
 comes 100 generations later, because it's not introducing anything of value, but simply

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.880
 destroying some information.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:19.440
 But he was emphasizing the mutation damage done by any radioactive isotope, natural or

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.440
 artificial.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:32.560
 And so he said that any addition made to the background radiation by the isotopes is going

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.160
 to cause cancer.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:43.200
 But the terrible thing is that the fallout from nuclear reactors and atomic bombs gets

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:51.480
 into the atmosphere as particles, which when ingested, if they stay in the body, they'll

00:09:51.480 --> 00:10:01.680
 eventually emit a particle which will either kill a cell or probably cause a mutation.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:13.320
 And so he was already making that point between the absolute difference between radiation

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:21.620
 that you get while walking past a granite table or a granite bank or something.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:26.040
 That passes through, delivers very little energy.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:35.400
 But any single alpha emitting isotope that you swallow is going to deliver all of its

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.960
 energy as that alpha particle is absorbed by the cells.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:51.480
 So it's like an absolute difference, not just the idea of the sievert or the REM was

00:10:51.480 --> 00:11:02.920
 used, they spoke of the renkin or the energy of the radiation coming out of a source, the

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:16.320
 rad as the absorbed dose of radiation and the REM or the equivalent in a person.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:24.800
 And the sievert is the new unit referring to that effective dose.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:36.880
 But that effective dose, unfortunately, is part of the obscuring the actual dangers because

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:43.720
 they define effectiveness as a killing or a mutation.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:54.080
 And that's exactly what Linus Pauling was talking about in which any single isotope

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.480
 particle would be enough to cause cancer.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:09.960
 But the people who are defending the industry are using this sievert unit or the radiation

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:23.320
 effectiveness biologically against the Pauling, Goffman, Sternglass people because effectiveness

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:28.440
 they are defining only in terms of mutation or killing.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:37.200
 And so their journals are full of showing how harmless particular types of radiation

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:49.600
 are if you don't kill the cell instantly and don't mutate it so that you can find a broken

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:57.400
 chromosome or a piece of changed DNA right after the exposure, then you have done no

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.400
 harm.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:08.560
 And that's where the situation is totally being falsified by the industry people.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:22.080
 And someone to check for the newer view that even it goes far beyond what Pauling and Goffman

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.040
 recognized the mutagenic effects of radiation.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:35.800
 And Sternglass was he was forced to recognize that there is something far beyond mutation

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:45.640
 and killing effective radiation when he saw the many changes that were happening around

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:57.960
 Three Mile Island where he got his large numbers were in stillbirths, thyroid deficient babies

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:09.280
 born or not born because of miscarriage by the mothers after they had ingested the isotopes.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:19.960
 Large numbers of underweight babies, miscarriages and thyroid deficient babies were produced.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:29.360
 And then when he followed up all across the country, he looked that the miscarriages and

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:38.080
 thyroid deficiencies followed just in the number of months that you would expect from

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.000
 the damage to the developing embryo.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.120
 Same with the production of leukemia.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.560
 It was intrauterine exposure that was producing leukemia.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.320
 But then he looked at all across the country.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:02.240
 He looked at the figures 18 years later in the scholastic aptitude scores.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:11.360
 And the first response to his pointing out the falling scores, which happened in Utah,

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:18.600
 there was a tremendous, I think it was a 26 percent decrease in scores 18 years after

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.720
 the heaviest exposure to bomb tests.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:31.120
 And it right across the country, the scores decreased in proportion to the radiation exposure

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.960
 of the mothers 18 years earlier.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:42.360
 The first reaction was that, well, more poor kids are now taking the test.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:51.760
 And he showed that that was wrong, that in fact there were lots more poor kids who were

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.000
 scoring lower taking the test.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:05.760
 But he looked at the high range, the very highest scoring students had decreased more.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:14.240
 They were the most sensitive to the destructive effects of prenatal radiation exposure.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:25.280
 And he didn't, one of his co-authors suggested that in vitro experiments with so-called cell

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:39.560
 membranes showed that the free radical production propagated in these membrane lipids and would

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:45.760
 have an extreme sensitizing effect to a very small amount of radiation.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:54.880
 But that wasn't, that was in vitro, somewhat hypothetical membrane thinking.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:03.920
 But Sternglass showed that some mechanism must be causing this much higher sensitivity

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.760
 than simply mutating or killing cells.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:20.400
 Even the industry people pretty much have to accept that the women who were exposed

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:30.160
 while pregnant to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, their children had smaller brains and

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:35.400
 were mentally retarded in proportion to the amount of radiation they got.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:43.760
 And that was blamed on just the killing of brain cells.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:55.920
 But just recently a study in Seattle of women getting dental x-rays, they would shield their

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:07.600
 whole body, but if they got a whole set of dental x-rays, the women, pregnant women delivered

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:15.360
 underweight babies from the general physiological effect.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:23.120
 Something happened when their head was irradiated by the dentist that was transmitted to their

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:30.120
 whole body that made the pregnancy less successful.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:41.520
 So the Sternglass effects are supported by this kind of study that shows that irradiation

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:47.640
 of any part of the body will affect the success of the pregnancy.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:54.480
 Even when the baby is born underweight, the brain is also underweight, sometimes worse

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.360
 than the general underweight of the body.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:09.320
 So there's something happening, lingering for months after the exposure in these actual

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.440
 experiences in people.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:21.320
 Fifty years after the people were exposed to the bomb in Japan and twenty years after

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:30.360
 the Chernobyl workers were exposed, samples of their blood have been tested with removing

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:36.520
 the cells from their serum.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:45.680
 Their serum was then added to healthy cells and it was able to cause mutations or chromosome

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:52.960
 breaks even twenty to fifty years after they had been exposed.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:20:03.840
 So the dental x-rays affected the whole subsequent pregnancy, but here people were demonstrating

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:12.160
 lingering toxic effects circulating in their body fluids decades after exposure.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:18.000
 If I could just play devil's advocate here, I would think that if somebody had survived

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:28.280
 for twenty years with those toxic effects from radiation in their blood and were still

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:34.760
 alive then I would think that the body was coping with it.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:47.120
 Well the exposed people had worse health and a higher rate of death from all causes, infectious

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:55.880
 diseases, heart disease, cancer, everything reduced the population faster, but the healthiest

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:05.280
 of them who survived a long time still were radically injured.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:20.000
 And the fact that it can linger through a person's long lifespan, studies have been

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.360
 done many times in animals and a few times in humans showing that for example radiation

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:37.640
 to a man's head will be associated with birth defects in his offspring.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:45.200
 Something is transmitted through his body the same way it is through a woman's body,

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:54.880
 which is sperm destabilizes them genetically so that the resulting offspring is genetically

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.240
 disrupted.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:04.560
 And the animal studies show that that sort of effect can go on generation after generation

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:17.320
 often getting worse each generation once the disorganization of the genome begins it can

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:23.160
 ultimately lead to the complete ending of the line, but sometimes it doesn't happen

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.880
 for several generations.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:35.280
 Do you know, speaking of Japan, previous nuclear horrors which are the atomic bombings of Hiroshima

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.680
 and Nagasaki, do you know how that was studied?

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:44.560
 I had heard that official health studies of the effects of the bombing didn't start until

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.280
 three years after the bombing, but perhaps I have that wrong.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.260
 Do you know anything about that Ray?

00:22:52.260 --> 00:23:00.000
 There were lots of effects, I don't remember exactly when they started, but both Goffman

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.580
 and Sternglass have reviewed those so it's worth looking at both of them.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:15.440
 One of the tricks the government used was to draw a circle around the bomb and then

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:25.740
 take people who were within a given radius of the bomb explosion and analyze their health,

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:34.140
 but the bomb explosion produced a cloud that went off in a triangular path according to

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.060
 the movement of the wind and the air.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:49.620
 And so the inclusion of everyone within a radius 360 degrees around was just a very

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:58.580
 obvious trick to dilute the actual effect of the people who got the fallout in a concentrated

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.580
 form.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:05.940
 I see, instead of comparing the downwinders to a control group of no exposure?

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:17.420
 Yeah, it was similar to adding Canadians and Argentines to the Hiroshima population to

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:24.620
 include people in the radius who didn't get any radiation exposure at all.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:30.060
 And so these, going back to Ernest Sternglass and Linus Pauling who were campaigning to

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:37.580
 stop above ground testing of atomic weapons, how were his studies and Linus Pauling's studies

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.080
 received?

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:52.460
 Well, I was one of the people talking about the difference between John Goffman and Linus

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.460
 Pauling.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:25:01.100
 John Goffman was saying Linus Pauling was a neurotic and a quack, and I was saying that

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.860
 John Goffman is either insane or a liar.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:06.860
 At the time.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:07.860
 Or just stupid.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:17.940
 And 20 years later, he suddenly had an insight and said that was the stupidest thing he could

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:26.620
 have ever done, but he was doing it regularly as his profession for the government to campaign

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.820
 against Linus Pauling and the anti-bomb people.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:39.140
 Yes, he was one of the main spokesmen for the Atomic Energy Agency, wasn't he?

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.300
 Yeah.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:48.740
 And his old stupid arguments are still, you can still find them anywhere on the internet

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:55.500
 and in the professional journals of radiation protection.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:01.180
 The industry is never going to give up as long as they're subsidized and supported by

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.580
 the government.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.060
 And any insight into how he happened to change his mind?

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.420
 It was a sort of an epiphany, wasn't it?

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:23.420
 Yeah, he said he was in the middle of a talk and said, this is a crazy thing to be saying.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:34.540
 Until we know that we're destroying all future generations of humanity, we should go on testing

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.460
 until we're sure.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:49.260
 And he later said that he and hundreds of other people in similar positions should be

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.100
 or could be tried for war crimes.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:59.980
 Yeah, and there was a quote recently that was in that letter by Chris Busby, Professor

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.940
 Chris Busby, who just wrote a reply.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:06.460
 If you search his name, you'll probably find his article on the internet.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:12.140
 Just wrote a reply to the atomic industry experts who are denying that there's any danger

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.340
 from the Fukushima plant.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:24.460
 And he's quoted Goffman as saying that the nuclear industry is waging war on humanity,

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.140
 which is that's quite a turnaround.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:33.420
 Yeah, and it wasn't really a total turnaround.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:37.340
 He still loved atomic bombs.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:51.180
 And he still, Linus Pauling in 1959 said that the figures for a low cancer rate in Denver

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:58.220
 must be wrong because cosmic rays give people a lot of radiation.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:05.180
 The nuclear industry likes that argument that if you live in Denver or fly in an airplane

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:14.940
 at high altitude, you're getting many times more radiation than breathing fallout from

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.340
 the nuclear plants.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:31.180
 And because of several, I guess, both personal and scientific reasons, both Pauling and Goffman

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:40.420
 never gave up that basic perception that would tend to validate those propaganda lines of

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.580
 the nuclear industry.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:50.820
 Just before he died, Goffman was still saying that you get more radiation by living in Denver

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.700
 than at sea level.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:59.180
 It's true that a certain kind of radiation is more intense, but the cosmic rays that

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:08.500
 they're talking about are relatively harmless compared to if you are at sea level where

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:16.580
 you get fewer of the primary cosmic rays, you get secondary and tertiary cosmic rays

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:23.300
 that deliver their energy into your body at a much higher rate.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:33.060
 So one of the most popular arguments of the industry is that anyone who flies or lives

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:41.220
 in the mountains has nothing to complain about getting some isotopes from the industry.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:57.380
 But it's a total deception and it's sort of sad that Goffman and Pauling never investigated

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:02.060
 the issue enough to be able to knock that one down too.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.540
 Well, can you knock it down for us, Ray?

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.940
 Because I don't think you've quite explained why the cosmic radiation isn't the same as

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.900
 ionizing radiation.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:18.180
 Well, the idea of linear energy transfer is the essential thing.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:26.700
 And the higher the velocity of a particle, the less likely it is to stop in your tissue.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:34.580
 And if you look at a track of a particle going through a target or a piece of tissue, when

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:45.900
 you find one that is losing enough energy that it's coming to rest, the track where

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:55.500
 it enters the tissue is only a pale gray showing not much interaction with the substance.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:02.180
 And as it slows down, it's like the point of a pencil.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:13.700
 The chemical reactions become saturating and black, exposing the film or whatever it's

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.980
 stopping in.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:27.100
 The ionization becomes extremely intense at the very last micron or two of movement

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.140
 of the particle through the tissue.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:34.260
 It delivers all of its remaining energy right in that cell.

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:42.100
 But if it passes through you at a high velocity, very little radiation is lost.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:50.660
 The type of radiation that we're exposed to when the cosmic ray primary goes through

00:31:50.660 --> 00:32:00.300
 us, it's the decelerating type of radiation where the particle is weakly deflected by

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:05.820
 passing through near the atoms in our body.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:13.900
 But the energy delivered is very small per unit of tissue.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:28.620
 And experiments have been done showing that their secondary and tertiary particles mostly

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.500
 are ending right near the surface of the Earth.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:39.780
 And so those are the ones which are doing most of the biological damage from cosmic

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.780
 rays.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:47.380
 So as far as the cosmic rays are concerned, it's worse to live at sea level.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:54.940
 But the industry argues the reverse, that high altitude is where you're getting the

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.980
 worst radiation.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:03.780
 So they're turning the evidence exactly upside down to support their interests.

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:11.260
 They do the same thing with the idea of radon gas.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:20.660
 They say people who are exposed to radon in their homes have less lung cancer than people

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.660
 who aren't exposed.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:25.540
 Therefore, radiation is good for you.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:34.140
 But the lung is the place that's least exposed to radon.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.660
 It dissolves in fat tissue.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:46.580
 And the brain being mostly fat is where your subcutaneous fat and brain get most of the

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.180
 radon exposure.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:57.380
 And in fact, the figures show that dementia corresponds very closely to radon exposure.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:01.260
 So you're saying the radon actually ends up in your brain if you're exposed to it.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.900
 And over time, that might cause Alzheimer's or dementia?

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:05.900
 Yeah.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:13.260
 But the industry says since you breathe it, you would expect lung cancer.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:20.420
 But no, you wouldn't expect it because it goes through your lung in a fraction of a

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.420
 second.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:25.820
 And does that coincide with radon maps of the United States?

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.140
 Yeah, dementia does.

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:33.100
 But lung cancer doesn't because it's a complete irrelevancy.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.100
 I see.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:39.860
 So it's a little bit of a red herring they're raising there again.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.860
 Yeah.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:51.220
 Some of the other experiments with cosmic rays that make the linear energy transfer

00:34:51.220 --> 00:35:04.660
 very clear, putting about a half an inch of lead as a roof over animals will cause them

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:13.700
 to miscarry or become sterile or develop cancer and other diseases at a very high rate.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:22.980
 And that's because of the slowing effect of the lead on the cosmic rays, increasing the

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:28.800
 probability of them coming to rest in your cells.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:36.820
 So a slow cosmic rays is somewhat equivalent possibly to inhaling one of the lower, less

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.060
 harmful emitters.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:42.780
 But once you inhale it and it lodges in a certain part of your tissue, all that energy

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:47.220
 is delivered right to one part of your tissue.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.220
 Yeah.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.220
 Yeah.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:55.780
 It's the coming to rest in your tissue that delivers the deadly energy.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:11.020
 And besides that killing mutating energy, the decelerating energy that's less harmful

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:21.380
 immediately, it still can have long range effects by giving misleading signals to the

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:29.300
 developing cell interactive systems.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:39.380
 One of the basic tricks behind this idea that radiation is only dangerous if it kills or

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:46.500
 mutates is the research done with bacteria.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:53.500
 And they extrapolate from bacteria to human beings.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:37:00.140
 To do that successfully, they just have to leave out the later lifetime effects of the

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:05.860
 radiation on that individual and then the subsequent generations effects.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.980
 I see.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:13.300
 They're using radiation to model what might happen to humans or other mammals.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.300
 I mean, based on bacteria.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.300
 Right.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:20.180
 And they only studied over a short period of time.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.180
 Yeah.

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.100
 Just the instantaneous mutating effects.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.100
 Oh, I see.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:35.820
 What they're looking at where Carmel Mothersill and her collaborators have demonstrated the

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.540
 bystander effect.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:47.380
 That it is transmitted through the body fluids when a man's head is irradiated or a woman's

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:51.900
 head and the baby is affected.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:38:00.220
 She and her group have shown that you can irradiate cells enough to cause death and

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:05.620
 mutations and so on in a culture dish.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:13.540
 And then you can take the fluid from those cells and add it to fresh cells and you get

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:20.740
 those cells behave just as if they had been irradiated to analogous to the effect of the

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:28.460
 serum from the Chernobyl workers causing chromosome breaks in cells from healthy people.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:32.100
 So there's some sort of instability that's set up.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.100
 Yeah.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:40.140
 And one of the transmitters that they have identified, there are probably a lot of things

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:45.180
 that cells emit when they're stressed.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:49.780
 One that they've tested is simply serotonin.

00:38:49.780 --> 00:39:02.660
 And they found that serotonin level of 25 nanograms per milliliter produced by the radiation

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:11.700
 damaged cells was enough to transmit genomic instability to new cells.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.980
 And that's without any extra radiation added.

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:14.980
 That's just the cell.

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:15.980
 Yeah.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:20.340
 That's just the indirect effect transmitted through the fluids.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:30.500
 And if they irradiated fish in water and then put new fish in the water, they suffered similar

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:38.860
 effects transmitted from the secretions into the water of the injured fish causing similar

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:42.820
 injury in the unexposed fish.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.400
 That's very interesting.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.820
 That's pretty recent research.

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:50.740
 I'm looking at the references in your paper and that's 2007.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:54.620
 So is this fairly new evidence that's coming to light?

00:39:54.620 --> 00:40:02.700
 Yeah, these few people are, if you look up bystander effect, you'll find hundreds of

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.220
 articles over the last 10 years.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:14.180
 But I was running into it in Russian research in the 1960s already.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:21.460
 They found that, in fact, I incorporated some of those ideas into my thesis work.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:29.260
 They showed that first they would irradiate an animal's head and showed that it affected

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.180
 the pregnancy later.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:40.060
 But then they found that irradiating any part of the animal had the same estrogenic effect

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:50.700
 and they used the term "stressin" as a name for the unidentified substance secreted by

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:59.060
 the injured tissue that would then transmit a genetic instability to the rest of the organism

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:03.620
 and the offspring.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:12.620
 The so-called stressins are now gradually being identified as the cytokines and serotonin

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:17.220
 and other things that injured cells produce.

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:20.060
 It's interesting you brought up Russian research.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:26.300
 One of the things I wanted to talk about today was the different interpretations of what

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:31.780
 happened to Chernobyl, at Chernobyl, with the meltdown there of the reactor back in

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:32.780
 1986.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:39.260
 We're just about at the 25th year anniversary of that event.

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:46.980
 And the World Health Organization, in association with the International Atomic Energy Agency,

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:56.380
 and UNSCEAR, which is a committee of the UN, has issued several studies about Chernobyl.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:42:01.900
 And their assessment of the damage done by Chernobyl radically differs with a Russian

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:05.980
 study that just came out a year ago.

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:13.460
 I think they said immediately, UNSCEAR basically said that the only people who were harmed

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:18.460
 were the immediate workers, and then there's been some thyroid problems that could have

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:25.020
 been alleviated if the government had acted quickly and issued potassium iodine for those

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.260
 children who were exposed.

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:34.300
 The Russian study, which I have the book in front of me, is quite amazingly thorough-looking,

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:43.380
 and it's taken them many years to put together, has said that over a million people have died

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:47.140
 with many more to come.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:55.340
 The Western journals reviewing, I think it was 300 basically Western articles published

00:42:55.340 --> 00:43:05.900
 in languages that Americans could read, concluded that 28 people died as a result of Chernobyl,

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:14.940
 or maybe as many as 60 or 70 died from cleaning up Chernobyl.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:23.900
 This group that wrote the book looked at, I think it was 5,000 studies, and concluded

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.820
 that a million people were killed.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:33.180
 Yeah, and it's not over yet, because that pollution is still on the ground.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:42.140
 It's the sort of difference that I've always seen that has led me to read foreign science,

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:44.980
 by preference to American.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.700
 I started running into it.

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:56.060
 I think I mentioned previously the book by Carl Lindgren called Cold War in Biology.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:07.260
 He documented the firings of college professors and even high school teachers who questioned

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:15.380
 the neo-Darwin approach to biology.

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:27.260
 I was aware that you couldn't trust American genetics and biology professors since that

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:32.740
 academic cleansing process had been done in the late 1940s.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:39.220
 Yeah, it sounds like science, especially, well maybe in every country, it's a political

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:45.780
 occupation because I'm speculating that people's jobs depend on taking certain points of view

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:51.060
 and holding them dear and not deviating from them, such as you were talking about genetic

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.060
 dogma.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:45:00.460
 That's the majority view or the consensus in this country is not necessarily agree with

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.460
 other people's theories.

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:13.860
 Yeah, that's the idea of having a consensus of scientists and of peer-reviewed journals

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:14.860
 and so on.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:22.300
 I see it as exactly the same as people who form their political views by taking a consensus

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:26.980
 of what the network newscasters are saying.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:30.540
 That's really how it works.

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:38.780
 It does form the political opinions of most Americans to watch the news and listen to

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:42.220
 their network radios.

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:47.860
 Today, speaking of the news, there was on Democracy Now, which is actually coming up

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:55.380
 in about 10 minutes, people who listen to that will hear George Monbiot, who's an English

00:45:55.380 --> 00:46:01.820
 environmentalist and a writer who writes in The Guardian, debating Helen Caldicott over

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:02.820
 nuclear power.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:10.460
 George Monbiot has witnessed the events at Fukushima through the news, as we all have

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:17.140
 so far, and he wrote an article saying that those events have actually convinced him that

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:23.740
 nuclear power is the answer because he said that we've had a terrible accident there and

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.540
 yet hardly anybody is hurt.

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:38.860
 He basically based that assumption he's making on the UNSEER and the IAEA UN health reports

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:45.940
 of what happened to the people of Chernobyl, where he said only 43 deaths resulted.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:50.940
 Helen Caldicott thought that was an outrageous lie and an insult to the people who actually

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:57.180
 did die in Chernobyl, and he accused her of being a conspiracy theorist because, of course,

00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:07.220
 an organization as prestigious as the UN Committee on Radiation wouldn't fabricate anything.

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:10.420
 Can you give us your take on that, Ray?

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:25.740
 Well, the UN is really primarily the instrument of the imperialist countries, and the nuclear

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:35.540
 industry wouldn't exist without the political support of the states, which represent corporate

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:44.380
 interests and the whole system works together.

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:56.820
 The public is taxed to finance the nuclear industry, and the state and the corporations

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:08.180
 support the universities and the broadcast media, so science has to, the same way as

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:19.740
 the who gets invaded, it isn't a matter of who is doing something objectively, it's who

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:24.060
 is hurting whose interest.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:31.340
 Helen Caldicott is threatening to hurt the interests of the nuclear industry, and so

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:36.820
 the whole system has to exclude people like that.

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:43.180
 You said that Linus Pauling had his passport revoked for taking stands against the development

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:46.220
 of nuclear weapons and above-ground testing.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:58.340
 Yeah, and professors, even when I was in graduate school in biology, when he had his passport

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:10.060
 revoked, the faculty, even at Caltech, were basically shunning him, and that I think motivated

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:23.740
 him to leave there under pressure, and even as recently as 1970, in the academic world,

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:34.060
 he was considered a quack and sort of an outcast, just because of his radiation peace position.

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:35.500
 Right.

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:42.900
 We're almost out of time, we have about eight minutes left, maximum, and I was looking at

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:48.500
 the Chernobyl book, it's called Chernobyl, Consequences of the Catastrophe for People

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:56.620
 in the Environment, by Alexei Yablokov, Vasily Nesterovich, and Alexei Nesterovich, and it's

00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:04.820
 edited by Janet Sherman, who's an American doctor, and published by the Annals of the

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:09.940
 New York Academy of Sciences, and in it, it has some very interesting statistics about

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:20.500
 disease in the United States, and linking that to fallout, and it shows a huge, from

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:26.380
 looking at the incidence of thyroid cancer in children, a huge incidence starting in

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:37.940
 1935, the thyroid cancer incidence quadruples, and I know we're told always that the cancer

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:41.900
 rate is going down, but it's things like that that make me doubt that.

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:52.620
 Yeah, and Chris Busby's article mentioned his research, showing that just a small increase

00:50:52.620 --> 00:51:05.620
 above background radiation was enough to cause something like a 20 to 90% increase in leukemia,

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:16.980
 if it was prenatal exposure, and when people say, "Oh, it's only 50% added to background

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:27.980
 radiation," as if that's nothing, an alternative point of view would be, "Well, let's see your

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:35.540
 evidence that background radiation is so safe, can you prove that it isn't killing 100 million

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:45.100
 people every year, because everyone is exposed to it, and it's known that that kind of radiation

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:51.420
 causes all kinds of disease, including infectious disease, susceptibility, heart disease, brain

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:55.420
 disease, and so on."

00:51:55.420 --> 00:52:05.460
 The people selling mammograms and other x-ray treatments or tests use that sort of comparison

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:14.580
 to background, but when you take your focus away from what they're specifically talking

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:28.020
 about, some Swedes did a big study about 10 years ago on the population who had been given

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:34.940
 mammograms, that they had noticed that the cancer mortality didn't decrease in Sweden,

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:42.620
 although most of the women were getting mammograms, and so they compared the ones who had had

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:54.700
 them and the ones who hadn't, and they saw that maybe there was one fewer cases of death

00:52:54.700 --> 00:53:04.100
 from breast cancer, but for every six increased deaths from something else, heart disease,

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:12.780
 for example, and Goffman showed that all kinds of medical x-rays to the chest increase heart

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:22.340
 disease as well as breast cancer, but when you limit the thing that you're focusing on

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:31.380
 and forget total mortality, then you can, with a little jiggling of the figures, you

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:42.540
 can get a slight decrease in a certain kind of mortality, but basically any exposure to

00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:51.420
 ionizing radiation is going to increase your chances of having a bad outcome, even if it's

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:53.620
 years and years later.

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:57.140
 So in the few minutes we have left, Ray, maybe you can summarize.

00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:02.860
 We have some background radiation going up now because of Fukushima and that disaster.

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:07.700
 Maybe you can just quickly outline what people can do to minimize their exposure.

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:17.500
 Yeah, if a very intense cloud comes by with a lot of radioactive iodine, the thyroid is

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:26.340
 the first thing that's able to be protected by eating iodine-rich foods or taking enough

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:32.460
 thyroid to suppress your thyroid-stimulating hormones so the gland becomes inactive.

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:41.180
 A spoonful of powdered kelp or other seaweed will pretty well saturate your body so you

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:45.860
 don't take up the radioactive iodine.

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:53.460
 Some of the things being recommended neglect the fact that the iodine is only going to

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:59.260
 protect your thyroid, but if you take too much iodine and suppress the function of your

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:09.340
 thyroid gland, you're going to slow all of your metabolic processes, including the DNA

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:11.380
 repair enzymes.

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:19.740
 So keeping your metabolic rate high by avoiding the toxic foods is very important for your

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:24.100
 general long-range resistance to radiation.

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:33.380
 The iodine danger is passed in about six weeks after the accident, so the long-range things

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:41.980
 such as cesium and strontium, you want to help to wash those out of your body after

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:51.060
 they've been taken in, and eating a calcium-rich diet and a potassium-rich diet will increase

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:59.300
 the turnover of these in your tissues, while a thyroid-supporting diet, low in the polyunsaturated

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:08.820
 fats, will increase the repair processes and prevent, to some extent, those long-range

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:15.500
 bystander effects that can increase for years after the exposure.

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.100
 And you mentioned red light before.

00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:19.660
 Is that an effective technique?

00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:20.660
 Yeah.

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:29.580
 During, for example, if you're near a flash of radiation, if you have a CAT scan or some

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:39.020
 kind of very intense radiation, those effects will linger as excited molecules in your tissue

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.380
 for hours.

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:47.140
 So if in the first hour after you get a flash exposure of intense radiation, you get lots

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:53.100
 of sunlight, or in the absence of sunlight, you want bright incandescent light that's

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.820
 rich in the red spectrum.

00:56:55.820 --> 00:57:04.580
 It's the red frequency that deactivates those excited electrons in molecules following intense

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:05.580
 radiation.

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:11.380
 And I suppose it would be best to avoid milk from cows that are eating in the field, if

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:12.860
 that comes from it.

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:20.460
 Well, yeah, but I, 40, 50 years ago, looked at the figures for the amount of radiation

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:28.300
 in milk and in vegetables, and the government was telling people to avoid milk that the

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:33.340
 cows had just absorbed strontium into.

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:41.780
 And I saw that if you ate vegetables for your nutrients, you would be getting several times

00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:49.700
 more strontium than you would from the milk, because the cow has concentrated calcium where

00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:57.020
 the plants tend to receive a high proportion of strontium from the fresh fallout.

00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:02.260
 So the cow is a good filter even during the fallout storm.

00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:03.700
 All right.

00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:10.740
 Well, Ray, thanks so much for your knowledge and advice and for talking to us today.

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.540
 Okay, thank you.

00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:13.540
 All right.

00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:14.540
 Goodbye for now.

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:15.540
 Bye.
