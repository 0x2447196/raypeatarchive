WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.160
 From 730 and to 8 o'clock the end of the show we do a live. I do a live call-in

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.520
 I say we because Dr. Raymond Peat

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.960
 Always joins us and has done for several years now

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:25.680
 The number of you on the reaches I'd love to hear from you about either tonight's subjects continuing topic of serotonin

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.120
 inflammation

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.560
 superoxide oxidants antioxidants

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.880
 And several other subjects, but the number is seven zero seven nine two three three nine one one

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.680
 For those of you who perhaps have never heard dr. Peat

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.840
 Will be giving out his details at the end of the show and for those of you who know a

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.880
 Lot about him and listen to lots of what he's got to say and read his books

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.040
 I'm sure you'll find this evening show just as informative

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.380
 It's a once a month show that we do from 7 to 8 p.m. And from 730

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.560
 Until 8 o'clock we do a live call-in so

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:17.760
 If people want to call in with questions related or unrelated to this month's subject on continuing topic of inflammation serotonin

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.480
 Etc numbers seven zero seven nine two three three nine one one so from 730 on

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.560
 And if people want to line up ahead of time before that that's just fine too because that also happens

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.400
 So once again very pleased to welcome introduce dr. Raymond Peat onto the show dr. Peat you with us. Yes, okay

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.440
 Thanks so much for giving your time again as you always do every third Friday the month for us

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:50.320
 For those people that perhaps have never heard you or heard your name heard you speak or know anything about you perhaps. Would you just

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.920
 Outline your professional and academic background and then we'll get into tonight's topic

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.480
 okay, I

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.760
 got a master's degree with a

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.600
 thesis on William Blake from University of Oregon

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.400
 1960 and then

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.440
 taught

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.000
 various

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 schools and colleges

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.040
 and in

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.800
 1968 I went back for a PhD in biology University of Oregon

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.880
 graduating in 72 and

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.960
 I've been following up on

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.320
 Pretty much the same interests

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.920
 ever since the 50s

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.760
 Studying how the brain and body work

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.660
 Okay, thank you. I was going to ask I wanted to ask I didn't didn't prepare this ahead of time

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.560
 But when when did you stop seeing people in person because you used to consult with people right?

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.280
 um, yeah, but

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.760
 1990 I think it was yeah

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.760
 Okay. All right

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.560
 Well, I just wanted to let people know also that's something I should have done at the very beginning of the show because I often find

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.000
 Myself wondering what month it was the show was done in

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.800
 It's November. So November the 15th

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.920
 2019

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.760
 the doctor Peat

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.480
 Carrying on from where we left off last month

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.920
 Talking about or discussing parts of your newsletter

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.840
 But and a small part of it because we didn't get a lot of time to to cover it. Excuse me, but I had

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.760
 some more questions in about

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:34.520
 Tryptophan and serotonin and given that serotonin is formed from this amino acid tryptophan

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:42.460
 If we are to if we're to avoid this like because the whole the whole ages of this is that

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.480
 Serotonin is an inflammatory molecule

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.800
 It's responsible for many negative effects in the body and obviously we'll get you to outline all of those things in detail here

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.920
 So people can understand just how?

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.520
 You know just how bad it is for you and its negative effects and why?

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.000
 The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are so bad for you given that they allow this

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.680
 product to remain

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.800
 in larger concentrations in the body

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.720
 How best how best can we avoid?

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.160
 tryptophan

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.840
 ingestion

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.760
 In order to try and get an edge on the serotonin that would be formed from it

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.280
 Tryptophan and

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.800
 Metabolites including serotonin is

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.720
 Essential for life

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.840
 every kind of

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.560
 organism is built with proteins containing

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.320
 tryptophan and

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.800
 The very nature of life as I see it and as Albert St. Georgie

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.200
 Researched it

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.320
 he for the last

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.480
 30 40 years of his life

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.280
 Was demonstrating the electronic nature of life?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.040
 the

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.040
 fluorescence luminescence

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.440
 electronic conductivity in such of

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.560
 living systems at the proteins

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.680
 interacting with water

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.480
 Producing excited electrons and of light emissions and

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:37.280
 Tryptophan is the amino acid that gives proteins that basic property that

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.160
 according to St. Georgie

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.280
 It is the the essential

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.000
 Mechanism of life that lets it

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.360
 Sense and move he was a muscle researcher

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.240
 among other things and

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.240
 this electronic property

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:04.640
 Is at the heart of both sensation and movement and all of the other?

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.120
 familiar properties of life

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.320
 nutrition consciousness and so on

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.600
 so it's a

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:22.080
 When when something goes wrong with tryptophan or its metabolites it disturbs life at its

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.080
 deepest level

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.040
 cell division and all other functions

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.280
 depend on this excitability of tryptophan and

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.240
 The in the muscle protein myosin for example

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.760
 There's one particular

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.200
 tryptophan which is most sensitive

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.280
 electronically and

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.080
 To light interactions such as phosphorescence

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.560
 and this

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:05.000
 tryptophan interacts electrically or electronically with cysteine

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.480
 which is an oxidizable sulfur protein and

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.800
 these are the

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.240
 sort of the electric motor of

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.280
 all the life processes

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.440
 and

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.800
 They happen to be the

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.360
 essential things during the growth

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.840
 process of an organism, but

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.680
 If you keep the same ratio

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.520
 coming in in your diet

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.000
 and

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 stop growing

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.640
 They're no longer being

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:50.200
 Consumed in proportion for growth and so they become

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.000
 sort of free actors which can spread

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.520
 excitability and oxidized ability

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.200
 randomly in the organism so during the growth period of an organism

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.080
 You need the full balanced range of amino acids

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:17.680
 but when when your body growth stops all you need to maintain

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.480
 The renewal of your skin and

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.160
 Intestine lining lungs

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.760
 All of the turnover of brain proteins that are being renewed and so on

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.840
 That's a very small amount of growth that's going on

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.640
 compared to

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.560
 in your

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.560
 infancy and teens

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:50.760
 Those those amino acids are are now at risk of becoming

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.400
 Random excitatory

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.400
 inflammation promoting processes and

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.320
 it happens that

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.840
 gelatin is a

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:09.680
 major protein that is used for building frameworks connective tissues and

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.480
 it has a

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.960
 complete lack of

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.800
 these excitable proteins cysteine

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.600
 thiamine and tryptophan and

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.200
 so if it becomes a major

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.520
 dietary protein when growth is completed

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.280
 then you reduce the

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.400
 the risk of

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.160
 the inflammatory and degenerative diseases

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.520
 Do you think this could be mitigated through I mean I know you don't at all

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.800
 promote any

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.800
 aerobic exercise or

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.400
 stress inducing exercise

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:53.000
 But given that I've come from a kind of not I am but I come from a kind of bodybuilding perspective

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.240
 Where you do recommend

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.440
 lightweight bearing exercise for people of all ages and actually

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.840
 very much

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.600
 Support is used for producing muscle mass muscle burning glucose

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.120
 being thyroid thyroid

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.600
 stimulatory and supportive

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:17.080
 If these amino acids are being consumed and somebody's actually doing some work then

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.520
 Does that would that warrant that diet remain in that way because obviously there's an ideal

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.040
 in life and you've mentioned the gelatin and it being

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.400
 completely

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:35.240
 absent from these inflammatory amino acids, but in terms of a balanced diet that would contain some of these

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.840
 Would you recognize work?

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.600
 doing work by lifting small weights and

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.680
 Exercising your body is

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.120
 Yeah by the age of 30 or 40 when growth is completed

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.640
 The

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:58.000
 bulk of our energy is spent just in maintaining the body

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.600
 But it has to function to be maintained and renewed

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.960
 if you

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:12.320
 Have a cast for example on your arm muscles will atrophy because they aren't being used

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.440
 So just to maintain

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.480
 What we have we have to be active and that includes

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.440
 mental or spiritual activity

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.600
 Keeping a freshness of perspective

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.160
 This is the

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.840
 The environmental enrichment and

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.760
 Yeah

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.120
 stimulation of everything

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.120
 Mental processes as well as

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:52.120
 Varied physical activity. Do you think there's a place for people to get more?

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:59.320
 It's kind of outside the context of this month's show, but I guess a leading question from what you're saying, but in terms of people

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:06.800
 Doing things that hopefully they're interested in obviously outside the mundanity of work if they're not interested in that, but they have to do it

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.160
 but

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.240
 actively actively engaging and pursuing things that

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.000
 require them to be mobile and engaging with environment and

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.840
 Yeah, environmentally enriching them to be a process that is supportive to the organism in terms of

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.400
 You know producing good

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.200
 Not just feelings but

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.040
 Good good good results in terms of feeling fulfilled and that fulfillment

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.800
 transferring into a mind-body state that's supportive rather than degenerative and

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:45.600
 Reductive, you know, it always has to involve newness and invention

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:52.880
 Even conversations can be relatively athletic

00:12:52.880 --> 00:13:02.080
 Okay, are you listening to ask you that herb doctor on Kamedi garble 91.1 FM and from 730 until the end of the show

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:08.240
 8 o'clock you invited to call in the number to reach us here is 7 0 7 9 2 3 3 9 1 1 and

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.320
 I just got to ask the engineer actually that the clock is missing. There is worse happen to the clock. I

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.520
 Didn't actually go check in there to make sure the clock was there. It's actually not here

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.800
 I suppose we should put that on our checklist. Well, not a bad idea

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.760
 I'll start like going like that when you get towards the end and I'll start doing the music very quietly

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.760
 I just want to make sure that we pay no attention

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:34.000
 The musical get loud and little just want to make sure that we have timely intervals remind people

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.960
 Well, I will I will say opens I will open the lines for calls that have passed. How about that? Sure. Okay

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.400
 So dr. Peat carrying on about tryptophan now

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:50.280
 You've always mentioned that this should be in balance and that's why you've always talked about gelatin gelatin rich products because it's in

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:55.760
 The muscle meats where we get the greatest proportion of tryptophan and that would be

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.480
 You know consuming excess amounts of muscle meats and I think you've don't

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.800
 Rate more than four ounces or six ounces

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.720
 As being beneficial for us because of the tryptophan content

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.960
 Yeah, so

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.280
 It's I guess it's possible

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.480
 to

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.400
 to avoid and again, this is kind of a little bit off topic, but I was

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.280
 looked at a program that was

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.680
 About plant-based and I don't want to get into a discussion necessarily about plant-based

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:33.200
 Versus animal based proteins, but it was quite an interesting documentary about and I think they followed

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.920
 Several people maybe four or five

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.520
 Quote unquote athletes obviously because I think they're at the top of their game

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:48.120
 but these people were either vegan or just basically got all of their protein from non animal sources as all plant-based proteins and

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:54.640
 They you and McGregor actually was that I don't have to know him, of course, but he's like an MMA fighter

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.960
 and he was at the top of his game and he was

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:03.400
 fighting a title bout that was gonna challenge him for his title and

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:11.320
 The chap that Reeves fighting was a vegan and in the interview McGregor was really castigating him and saying that he was

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:16.960
 You know just a plant eating, you know, whatever. He was weak and he was gonna destroy him in the fight and

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:25.320
 McGregor lost and it was such a shock in the circle because he was at the top of his game and

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:32.020
 They proved they were doing this physiologically showing that meat consumption. I'm not anti meat at all

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:32.840
 You know

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.200
 But they were showing that a consumption of meat

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:42.720
 Actually slowed the organism down and it actually I know you've mentioned things like cadaverine and putrescene as being byproducts of meat

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.160
 And definitely which is why you advocate not hanging meat

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:53.280
 you know like they do in England perhaps or hang pheasants until they start falling apart and same with their you know, the

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.880
 Venison, but anyway getting getting back to this title fight

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:04.680
 They said that they showed physiologically how it was slowing him down and how his muscles were not able to

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:13.320
 repolarize reactors repair as quickly and recover as quickly and they were saying that it was pretty much based on his diet and they

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.400
 were really

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:19.640
 They were really putting meat consumption down, but I don't know if I think the highest phosphate content

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.000
 Relative right the calcium is a big part of that

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:31.400
 Wastes the energy it's like a constant subliminal stimulus

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:37.840
 Tend to tend to load the cells up with calcium

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.200
 as if they were

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.280
 fatigued already

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:50.720
 Honey, would you would you be supportive of a plant-based protein diet over getting any kind of meats?

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.720
 Because I know you've you know, you're really

00:16:52.720 --> 00:17:01.520
 You stand very strongly behind gelatin and well, the problem is that a lot of the plant-based proteins are either

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:10.400
 Overloaded with phosphate the same as meat or or they have potential allergens and

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:19.400
 Offensive molecules that the plants are right have that no no animal has right so you just you still advocate

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.520
 very simple amino acid type

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.400
 Gelatin protein sources and then obviously things from dairy

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.640
 Cheese milk and eggs is good quality clean proteins

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.780
 Yeah, but it's a tremendously important field for research to

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.400
 find what plants

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.240
 Have the proper

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.640
 Nutrients and don't have the toxins right so that you say you

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:51.400
 they nearly always see the conjugated with the oil was a liquid or so that you know polyunsaturates from the nuts and

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:57.560
 Yeah, then there's other sources obviously tofu and soy soy protein has been

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:01.240
 Implicated with having kind of estrogenic effects

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:06.000
 Yeah, okay, all right, so

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 anyway, so getting back to

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.640
 Getting back to what we were talking about with tryptophan and serotonin

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:19.280
 I wanted to ask about and this will be this will branch out a little bit later into

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.440
 insulin

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.960
 resistance

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.960
 and

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.960
 Cholesterol production and

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.720
 Yeah, kind of just go in a few different directions

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:35.040
 But I try and keep it as focused as possible that superoxide dismutase

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.840
 Then this is an enzyme that degrades superoxide and superoxide sold

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.800
 you know as a health food supplement and

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.760
 It's an extreme oxidant, correct

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:52.000
 Yes, and so and so very damaging and I know last month I asked you just to

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.320
 break down the oxidation

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.080
 antioxidation

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.680
 Kind of concept because we're bombarded with these

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:08.520
 And obviously vitamin C is an antioxidant and we know vitamin C is very good. But there's also antioxidant effects that are not

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.440
 necessarily positive correct oh

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.400
 Yeah

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.360
 too much of an antioxidant of

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.520
 It's typical cancer metabolism for example, right?

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.800
 Okay, so then that cancer metabolism is a lactic acid producing

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.360
 Physiology

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.360
 Yeah as a byproduct

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.520
 Okay. All right. So

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:40.400
 Let's move on then to talk about proteins in terms of muscle building and that kind of thing. But

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.000
 Most proteins contain tryptophan then which is converted to serotonin

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.600
 And do you think it's possible to contain enough non tryptophan containing proteins for continued muscle growth and repair?

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:01.900
 All of the proteins other than gelatin that I know of

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:10.000
 Will support proper growth and repair, right? Okay. All right, it's very straightforward then. All right, and then

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.160
 Let's have a look here

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.120
 I wanted to ask you about the pH of the blood and I know there are people

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:24.440
 Where especially on the internet if you're looking for any kind of guidelines for health or health related topics

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.160
 they'll talk about acidity and

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.320
 alkalinity and

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.040
 I know the pH of the blood is kept very tightly between

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.360
 seven point three five and seven point four five I think

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:44.880
 How much can this change I mean it's not really possible for that to change is it oh, yeah, I've seen

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.080
 Very sick people with extremely high

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.800
 blood pH

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:56.840
 Seven point five or six for example, really? Okay, it's a can go outside that range

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.320
 I thought the body did everything it can to keep it

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.400
 It does a person has to get really sick for the blood to change

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.920
 Outside that range. Okay, and and you can do it

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.880
 momentarily just by hyperventilating

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.320
 Blowing breathing so fast that your

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.960
 Carbon dioxide is being lost and

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:25.720
 That can push your your blood pH very high to the point that you

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.400
 Might faint or die

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:36.000
 When you lose too much co2 the increased pH tends to cause

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.720
 Spasms including blood vessel spasms cutting off the circulation of your brain

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.800
 Can you do the opposite of that because I know you're

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.800
 an advocate of

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.560
 increasing co2

00:21:52.560 --> 00:22:00.360
 Rebreathing in a paper bag, for example, you can correct out and forward the pH of your blood

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:08.580
 To the to the point that it can start weakening your muscles and causing too much vessel dilation

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.360
 So it is possible to go the other direction equally and oppositely

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.720
 Yeah, muscle weakness is the worst thing

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.680
 All right, there's nothing too much more serious than that because I know some people were

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.240
 really really getting into co2 baths and

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.480
 rebreathing co2 is a kind of

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.400
 Yeah, if you're just soaking it in through your skin

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.920
 Since you're breathing in the ordinary air

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:43.480
 Even though you're absorbing a really large amount of it through your skin it's going to

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.160
 Equalize with the air and so you can't overdose sitting in pure co2

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.680
 All right

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:57.200
 Can I want to move on again just to reiterate this for some people perhaps? I'm not too sure

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.600
 The connection was made quite as clearly as this but I was looking at

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:08.560
 I was looking at some articles today just going through some material to see what else could be fleshed out with this evening's

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.200
 talk carrying on from last month, but

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:19.480
 Statins are we I'm gonna get one about statins again, but just just to mention again that the brain

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.800
 Actually creates its own cholesterol and

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.480
 cholesterol

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.760
 Systemically is too big a molecule to get across the blood-brain barrier

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.220
 and I know I asked you last month about the blood-brain barrier and how

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:39.840
 Physiologically intact it was and I know that you mentioned several

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:47.080
 Several components that wouldn't typically get across a blood-brain barrier could in certain instances and I think a little bit like the intestinal

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.680
 barrier

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.320
 Fairly large fats can massively go into the brain

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:57.160
 Well they came from the blood

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:03.760
 Interesting, okay, so you say fat some fairly large fats, but you don't think that cholesterol will pass the blood-brain barrier D

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.000
 Yeah, I think it can

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.920
 Wow

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.080
 Okay, because I what I wanted to say was that in so far as the literature is concerned

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.440
 I'm not saying the literature has it right and you don't but so far as the literature is concerned

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:23.680
 That that molecules they say is too big to get across the blood-brain barrier and and hence

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:30.200
 Whatever the biological reason for however long we've been around the brain

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.400
 Because it is such a both energy

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:39.320
 Hungry or organ and because the white matter of the brain is principally cholesterol

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:46.320
 they say that 20% of the body's cholesterol is actually in the brain and presumably because of the white matter and

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.160
 presumably because of the

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.600
 Insulating effect of cholesterol on the neurons and that

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.720
 the enzyme

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.320
 HMG Co a reductase

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.800
 Produces

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.800
 cholesterol and

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.840
 Statins for those people unfortunately who might be using them

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:12.880
 But hopefully they'll look to an alternative if they don't completely ban them, but they probably won't because they're making too much money from it

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:18.920
 This the statins do pass and cross into the blood-brain barrier, so I

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:25.680
 Imagine what they do to the brain is what they do to the muscles and if you're

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.840
 soaked in

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.680
 statins and

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.720
 do vigorous exercise the

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:40.680
 Interference with cholesterol can cause your muscle to break down and simply dissolve and disintegrate

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:47.200
 And I'm afraid that same thing can happen in the brain accounting for the

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.360
 depression

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:56.600
 Suicidality and such right because they're saying they're saying that these are some of the common side effects that they advertise as part of their

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.600
 disclaimer for the products that

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:05.040
 but just to bring out again from a kind of a simplistic maybe mechanistic point that

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:11.120
 The fact that you have this stacking crossing into the brain and actually lowering your brains brains cholesterol

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.200
 Is a definite reason of cause for concern because typically?

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:21.520
 If you had a low cholesterol situation, which was not actually

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.360
 You know due to

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.400
 Just an inherently high

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.760
 Genetic reason for producing cholesterol that if you start lowering it systemically

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:38.160
 And this is crossing into your brain and your brain is suffering as a result of this you're going to get some very

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.000
 very odd neurological

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.240
 side effects of it

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.960
 the old brain is sort of like a

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.040
 clump of atherosclerosis

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.280
 it's a

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.360
 lots of cholesterol, but it's bound to fatty acids and

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:04.720
 In in the old brain free cholesterol is actually lower than in the young brain. It's the bound up

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:13.400
 Interfering type of cholesterol that accumulates in the aged brain as in the aged blood vessels

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.260
 Hmm, but your brain is not like that is it?

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.760
 Avoiding vegetable oils

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:28.640
 Good all right you're listening to I have no idea what time it is, but you're okay there

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:33.840
 You go you're listening to ask your doctor came you de Galvo 91.1 FM and from now on to 8 o'clock

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.480
 You're invited to call him the questions dr. Raymond Peat

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:42.400
 Is our guest and the number if you live in the areas or if you even if you don't live out in the area if you?

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:47.120
 Live anywhere on the planet. It's seven zero seven nine two three three nine one one

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.280
 I

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:57.200
 Looked at and to be your counting okay. It's expecting the phone to start ringing okay, so I was looking at some some

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:02.760
 Some articles this afternoon. I saw an article about hand cellular, which you mentioned

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.800
 Quite a lot saying that he was doing work on muscular dystrophy

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:15.680
 And by administering serotonin to animals this was this was caused he actually gave that he could precipitate

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.280
 muscular dystrophy in animals

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.880
 Um yeah, and

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:27.560
 that was in the late 50s and early 60s that he was doing those experiments and

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.560
 Despite that being in the literature

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.600
 in the 70s

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:41.600
 Tryptophan supplements became a popular fad and there was a lot of

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.600
 Sickness produced by it

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.840
 I

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.240
 think there were

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.240
 mental problems, but

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.040
 muscle inflammation and an immune

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.480
 problem

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.480
 was the

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.640
 Focus of the disease that became

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:08.640
 Well known and the FDA blamed it on on a bad

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.520
 type of

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.600
 tryptophan that they never explained, but

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.520
 Hansell you was producing it with

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.200
 tryptophan simply in excess

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:27.200
 Okay, all right. We have a we have a caller on the on the line, so let's take this caller call away from what's your question?

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:32.200
 Hi, good evening. I'm calling from Santa Barbara, California. Hi welcome to show

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:39.440
 Thank you. I just have a question are you familiar with the hair tissue mineral analysis test?

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.800
 Yep, don't say yeah

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:49.800
 Okay, great. I just had some results of that and my first question was is I have a very high

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.520
 sodium to potassium

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.800
 potassium ratio my my

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.240
 Sodium is

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:05.920
 34 and my potassium is one. I just wanted to know what could be causing that and

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.920
 What do you do about it? What's a hair analysis? Yeah

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.560
 It could be that you

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:19.840
 Have hard water or have a water softener that puts sodium into the water

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.160
 Yes, Santa Barbara has water softeners in lots of the houses

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:27.600
 Do you have do you have a water softener in your house? Yes, I do

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:33.320
 Yeah, okay, that puts sodium into the water and so it will skew the hair test

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.920
 Okay

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.400
 and then just one more on those I

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.400
 Have a the ratio between the calcium and the potassium is

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:49.880
 It very skewed as well. My calcium is 46 and the potassium is one

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:54.640
 I

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.920
 I'm not sure that that

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:03.480
 could be from hard water rather than softened water, but I wouldn't worry about a

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:08.760
 Hair mineral test a serum test is much more useful

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:14.560
 Right. Yeah, there you go. It's basically anything that you're exposed to that

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.160
 Dr. Peat mentioned in the first instance here if you're showering and your water has been

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:24.520
 Softened that way then that could easily explain how the hair would take up those components and would show to be

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:28.920
 High in one and low in another but obviously blood tests are the best way to do it

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:35.800
 Okay, did you have any particular reason for testing your hair or was this just a curiosity?

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.000
 No, yeah, I am working like with a

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 functional

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 nutritionist and I've

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.080
 Had the Dutch hormone testing done previously and I've had some

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:55.760
 Stool sampling done and so as we progress kind of trying to figure out the puzzle pieces of my symptoms

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.720
 This was another

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:04.600
 This test was recommended by her. Yeah, do you feel like you want to talk about what it was?

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.080
 You were looking for help for or oh sure. Yeah, I

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:13.160
 basically a couple years ago I started having symptoms of

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:22.280
 Hypoglycemia, which I still have now and how old you I'm 46. Okay, go carry on

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.560
 Yeah, so I've had that I've had

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:32.640
 Basically increased weight gain during these last couple years. I've gained probably about 40 pounds

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.280
 I have changed my diet

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:40.560
 Significantly that was obviously a big problem for me. But my my diet is very

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:45.720
 I follow a lot of dr. Peat's recommendations my

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.160
 my practitioner follows his work, so

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.480
 I've in you know done a lot of those changes and everything, but

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.360
 Basically, I have like hypoglycemia. I have problems with anxiety

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:01.280
 My inflammation marker is very high

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.360
 And then like I said the weight gain and my

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.560
 hormones

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.060
 Indicate I have high cortisol

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:14.000
 So those are all kind of things that we've been trying to work on

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:21.520
 Okay, Dr. Peat hypoglycemia with high cortisol and weight gain and anxiety and anxiety

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:26.760
 And calcium and and thyroid are

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.400
 likely involved vitamin D calcium and thyroid

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.560
 Have you have you had your vitamin D measured?

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.320
 Do you know what that is?

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:42.080
 Yes, the most recent one I've had done. I want to say it was around

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.440
 50 ish

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.360
 Then

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.360
 amount of calcium in your diet

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.600
 works with both

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:59.020
 Thyroid and vitamin D to keep your metabolic rate up and your blood sugar steady

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.480
 Okay

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:07.120
 To two grams a day of calcium is it's a good level

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.000
 Do you drink any milk or do you take a calcium supplement or?

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:19.640
 I don't take a calcium supplement, but I do drink milk, and I do eat high quality dairy. How much milk do you drink?

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:22.800
 I

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.800
 Was well I've increased that

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:30.760
 Per dr. Peat so I mean for me probably about 16 ounces, and I'm drinking

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:38.480
 2% milk yeah, I think twice that much of 1% would be better

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:47.560
 Took two quarts of what skimmed or 1% helps to lose weight because of the high calcium content

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.240
 and you said

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.320
 About like there. What did you say on the ounces?

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.240
 From 1 to 2 quarts

00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.120
 Okay, 1 to 2 quarts of okay

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.320
 Okay

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:09.040
 That tends to increase your temperature and if your temperature doesn't

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:16.960
 Rise quickly in the morning when you get up and eat breakfast if it doesn't get up to 98.6

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.880
 by

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.880
 half hour after breakfast

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.800
 But then you're likely to need a thyroid supplement, too

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:32.880
 Yeah, I do. I do the temperatures and pulses and I tend to have low temperatures

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.680
 And then I did I did try

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.880
 some nature throid

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:46.720
 a very like of the like the lowest dosage I forget the like quarter grain or

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.080
 Something like that, but I started having

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.880
 More negative effects with it

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:58.960
 I started having like my anxiety was more increased and I started having like more aggressive

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:06.600
 Like behavior like a real short fuse and that kind of stuff so I quit taking that after about a month

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:12.600
 One of the effects of

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:19.120
 thyroid is to make your cells able to retain the magnesium that they need and

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.280
 If your diet doesn't have enough magnesium

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:29.640
 And two quarts of milk would give you a generous supply of magnesium

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.440
 which would make the

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.720
 thyroid able to work more quickly and

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:45.240
 The normal function of thyroid is to increase your ability to relax both both muscles and nerves

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.960
 Okay

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.600
 Okay, I appreciate your time. Thank you both so much. Yeah, you're welcome

00:36:52.600 --> 00:37:01.200
 Okay, so people want to call in numbers seven zero seven nine two three three nine one one dr. Raymond Peat's with us in the studio

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.760
 Okay

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.760
 so dr. Peat

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.760
 going back to the

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:12.880
 Going back to positive effects, and we've mentioned it's positive. It's only ever positive, but it's demonized

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:18.200
 in the industry in terms of treatments for lowering it

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.720
 cholesterols effect is

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.040
 Undoubtable in terms of regulating

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:29.240
 regulating the system regulating and supporting and stabilizing cells

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.480
 Let me just okay. There's a call on the line

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.400
 Let's get this caller before we jump into this next question caller you're on the airway from

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.000
 I'm from Mendocino County. Okay. Hi. What's your question?

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.520
 My question is from recently diagnosed with osteoporosis, and I was wondering an alternative way to treat that yeah

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.440
 How old are you?

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:54.680
 62 62 okay, there's plenty of good plenty of good ways to do this, but let dr. P

00:37:54.680 --> 00:38:02.360
 Let Dr. Peat discuss it. Go ahead Dr. Peat. Okay keeping keeping the parathyroid hormone

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.800
 under control is

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.640
 essential and

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.240
 Eating a lot of calcium

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:15.960
 like two quarts of milk and keeping your your

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:22.440
 vitamin D serum level up to the middle of the range like 50 mg per ml

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.520
 That

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.240
 Is a good basis, but if your thyroid

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.760
 Hormone is low

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.760
 Then your your prolactin

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:41.920
 Will likely be high enough that the prolactin itself as a bone weakening effect

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.960
 Prolactin is normally the hormone of lactation

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:51.000
 And it takes calcium out of the bone

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.800
 normally to put into the milk but

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.600
 under stress it causes

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.360
 calcium to be lost from the bone and

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:08.160
 Prolactin tends to rise along with thyroid stimulating hormone and

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.920
 The

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:19.960
 simplest way to normalize prolactin is to normalize your thyroid function keep

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:24.120
 Keep your thyroid stimulating hormone

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.960
 At the lower end of the normal range

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:37.400
 Okay, how do you keep the thyroid how do you do that um if you can't do it just with a selection of foods

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.560
 then a supplement

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.120
 A thyroid supplement, yeah

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:50.720
 Yeah, and I do not like milk so is there something else that I could do to get calcium oh?

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:55.680
 Well cooked greens are

00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:03.800
 Food that's richest other than milk and calcium relative to phosphate

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.480
 but

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.480
 if you grind up eggshells

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:14.440
 That's a good pure form of calcium carbonate which is next best to milk

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:19.520
 Okay, how much how many ground-up egg cells that you do per day? Oh?

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.360
 A couple of grams would be good

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.240
 Okay

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.200
 Yeah, so you can just use your eggs if you use eggs you can just put them to one side and

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:35.120
 Gently wash out the membrane and stack them up for a week or so and then after a week you can put them on a

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.520
 Baking tray and put them in the oven at about 150

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.280
 and

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:45.000
 Basically sterilize sterilize them that way and then put them in a coffee grinder, and then they'll grind up very finely into a fine powder

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.120
 Do have some people who use these?

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:54.600
 Kind of approaches to calcium rather than pills and capsules that do say that and best taken with food

00:40:54.600 --> 00:41:00.960
 Can irritate some people's stomachs, but it's a very clean way especially if we're using organic eggs

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:06.160
 To get a good quality calcium carbonate, and it's almost all calcium so

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.920
 2,000 milligrams a day is what dr.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.960
 Peat said so two grams it's about it's about three one eighth teaspoons

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.920
 I think I think an eighth teaspoon is 650 odd milligrams

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:25.080
 Okay, yeah, so if you don't drink milk or eat cheese or get lots of cooked greens, and you are calcium

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:34.240
 Calcium lean then that's obviously gonna work against you, but can I quickly ask you what kind of menstrual history you had I?

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.640
 Had I went to menopause at early age at 45 45. Yeah, all right

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.520
 I just spoken to a lot of women who have

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:46.160
 Either had hysterectomies and very poor hormone replacement

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:54.960
 Approaches done or have had really bad menstrual cycles and been very high estrogen and a lot of these women show very

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:55.960
 early

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.480
 Osteopenia I mean in their 40s and in osteo

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:05.960
 bordering osteoporotic by 50 it's not what you want you really want to address this and vitamin D and

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:12.440
 Calcium and thyroid are going to be the best least invasive and certainly most tolerable

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:17.320
 approach to dealing with your osteoporosis because you're only young and

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:20.760
 You know hopefully you're gonna live quite a while longer, and it's gonna

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.620
 It's not gonna get any better if you don't address it

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.200
 unopposed cortisol

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.200
 other bone dissolving

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.960
 What is that?

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.960
 cortisol

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:37.640
 If it's even in the higher part of the normal range in a morning test

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.540
 if it isn't balanced with the

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.320
 adrenal

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.320
 DHEA and progesterone and other adrenal

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.880
 steroids

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.560
 that can can contribute to

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.320
 osteoporosis and

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.600
 supplementing

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.600
 progesterone and DHEA

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.800
 and or pregnenolone

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.360
 Can oppose that effective cortisol?

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.280
 Okay, all right. Thank you very much. Dr.. Peat

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:13.400
 Okay, good, so the number if you live anywhere on the planet, and he's like to ask dr.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.520
 Peat a question during this evening's call

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:21.200
 Ending at 8 o'clock here with seven zero seven nine two three three nine one

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.720
 seven zero seven nine two three three nine one one

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.680
 So dr. Peat just getting back to cholesterol for a little bit

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:35.920
 in terms of what has been so popularized and so treated with statins

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:43.680
 Cholesterol's positive effects. I think are just beginning to come to pass you know and I think it's a little bit like a sea change that's

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.120
 occurred with the

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.120
 whole perpetration of

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:53.560
 Polyunsaturated supposedly being good for you and saturated fats being bad for you, which is I think now at last

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.200
 finally seeing the light of day and

00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:01.960
 I'm reading reports on the internet. I'm not saying the internet is the only sole source of any information, but

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:09.520
 Seeing some good articles coming out about how that is just so and he's been talking about it for 40 years or more

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.000
 I'm sorry that it's taken

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.040
 So long for everybody you know including us ten years ago is still thinking that helps the way it was but I'm

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.960
 Also starting to see some good articles that have been written

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:26.920
 Expounding the benefits of cholesterol and just outlining in very plain simple layman terms

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:32.360
 Just how beneficial cholesterol is and why it's so important and that the whole LDL HDL

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:39.480
 Thing is a complete myth, and they're actually a lot more studies showing that some of these oxidized LTL particles

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.480
 They're probably more responsible for the inflammatory

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:46.920
 initial insult on the endothelia of the vessels that then causes

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:55.320
 Cholesterol to be laid down as a repair mechanism which during dissection of a cadaver who's died of a heart attack for example

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.780
 They'll say oh, that's it. They say here. I is a cholesterol. It's blocked the arteries

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:05.520
 That's why he's dead when actually all the time you and you boy said it's the initial insult from things like lipofluxin or other

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.760
 oxidative byproducts of lipid metabolism that have caused initial insult

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:14.840
 But in terms of the brain and the brains functioning

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.800
 so cholesterol

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.560
 I can't we can't really can't really state it enough. Just how important it is to have

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.920
 adequate cholesterol and that low cholesterol is

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:34.240
 virtually unspoken about people you find it very hard to find any information regarding low cholesterol because no one's looking that way and

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.240
 I wonder just how many people

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.800
 Actually present with a blood test and their doctors saying oh your cholesterol is great

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.760
 You know whenever I've had blood work done and my cholesterol is played

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.080
 120 at the moment

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:50.520
 It's always wow your cholesterol is great, and I'm thinking no. It's not it's nowhere near high enough

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:57.200
 You know and I know you've always said that you should be about 200 so a cholesterol of 120 is obviously not good for me

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:05.160
 But yeah, it's not at all influenced by diet and in terms of your body will make cholesterol out of just about anything

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.840
 Yeah

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:13.600
 Okay, there's a caller on the end. Let's get this caller. I call you. Yeah, where you from what's my name is John and

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.640
 I'm 78 over the last

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:24.880
 Year or maybe a little more I guess my PFA's gone up, okay precipitously yeah

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.720
 from four to five to

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.400
 20 okay

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:34.960
 And I wonder if there's any supplements that can help me drive that down. Yeah

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:40.420
 Talks P. It's probably not in isolation for this, but this person's PSA

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.160
 is 20 now

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.800
 Um I think everything

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:49.360
 Anti-inflammatory is the right approach

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:52.680
 a diet

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:58.240
 Low in phosphate is a very basic anti-inflammatory thing

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.840
 And so on

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:06.600
 The

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:11.480
 Cooked cooked greens cheese milk and eggs are

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.920
 anti-inflammatory foods

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:20.200
 Keeping your thyroid function up so that your

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:30.200
 Your liver is helping to balance your hormones keeping estrogen down

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:38.120
 Adequate protein a good calcium phosphate ratio and

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:42.760
 Fairly

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:48.080
 High normal a body temperature is important

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:54.400
 Lower inflammation and keep the ratio of estrogen low

00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:03.640
 Do you think dr. Peat from my from an herb herbal medicine perspective the kind of rationale of using aromatase

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:08.000
 inhibitors from things like nettle root or using the sterols

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.480
 Probably from saw palmetto might be

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:14.240
 anti-estrogenic and that's how

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.000
 that could be a rationale for treating high

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:24.800
 Prostate hypertrophy if you do you think I prostrate hypertrophy is down to estrogens as much as anything else yeah

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.640
 Estrogen love

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.920
 It's a growth and carcinogenic

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.000
 factor

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:39.200
 In the prostate right and as men get older their estrogen no doubt rises especially as testosterone is on the decline

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:45.520
 Yeah, and the men who live the longest with prostate cancer have the highest testosterone

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.720
 What?

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:52.480
 The men that live the longest yeah with prostate cancer have the highest testosterone

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.040
 Yeah, so in that okay?

00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:00.960
 Yeah, so that the testosterone that in that point then it's kind of protective huh yeah

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.960
 And in the early 90s

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.040
 when

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:10.520
 They started using the PSA test as a diagnosis of prostate cancer

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.600
 the

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.720
 Mortality from prostate cancer

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.760
 took a huge surge upward

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.040
 and

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:27.280
 Some of the doctors noticed that and decided maybe it wasn't a good idea to diagnose prostate cancer

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.720
 Right because a lot of the times you have said this quite a few times before now

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:36.880
 But a lot of the times it can not advocating people just don't do anything about a supposed cancer marker

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.440
 That is you know possibly

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.160
 treatable especially from a medical perspective

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.480
 but

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.480
 You've mentioned quite a few times that people

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.520
 found

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:54.520
 In in the mortuary they've just died from some other cause and they've been found with a wide range of different cancers that hasn't been the

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.180
 Thing that's killed them or they've been found with prostate

00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:05.760
 enlargement and or you know benign type dysplastic prostatic inflammation a couple studies found that a hundred percent of

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:09.920
 people who died at the age of 50 or more

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:14.800
 All of them had diagnosable cancer some right yeah

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:19.800
 Yeah, so the the the call a the the best thing the best things for you

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:24.560
 Talking about what dr. Peat's been mentioning if you can obviously

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.400
 maintain physical activity

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:34.560
 In terms of keeping a testosterone as high as you can from being a male that's certainly very protective and anti estrogenic

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.560
 estrogen being one of those

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:44.160
 Hormones that rises in males especially in males that are obese or you know they have more fat than is good for them

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:51.080
 Especially because of that tissue tends to accumulate and or produce estrogen in its own right and then there are two

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.280
 Herbs that I know there's more than that

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:58.600
 But the two that come to mind instantly are things like nettle root as an aromatase inhibitor

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:06.440
 And that has an effect blocking estrogen and then the saw palmetto extract, but there's lots of there's lots of information about

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.200
 alternative medicines for

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.920
 enlarged prostate

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:18.080
 but I think obviously keeping an eye on your your PSA in conjunction with using some of those herbs that have been used for

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:20.280
 prostatic enlargement and

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:26.840
 Making sure that your estrogen is being opposed by testosterone and getting exercise and aspirin

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:35.360
 There you go and aspirin certainly something that's very well tolerated very inexpensive and very easily to get hold of

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:42.360
 Okay, we do have one more caller on the air, so let's get this next caller call it you're on the airway from them

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:46.520
 What's your question? I'm in Humboldt and Redway, okay?

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.960
 My question is how can I get off selexa?

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:56.220
 Okay, we had we had a very similar question last month about a lady who called in

00:51:56.220 --> 00:52:02.320
 on SSRIs and wanted wanted help with that so

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:08.920
 In terms of in terms of a dose have you ever tried reducing the dose of this and then?

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.800
 slowly withdrawing from it

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.180
 I would be willing to try that yeah

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:22.260
 It's one. I mean Dr. Peat in terms of withdrawing we've we talked about this last month so in terms of withdrawing

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:24.680
 From an SSRI it's not to be done

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:29.560
 unsupported, but you mentioned last month that there's

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:34.160
 Plenty to do in terms of support in the physiology with thyroid

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:39.720
 with other you know positive lifestyle diet changes that

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:46.600
 basically will allow a person to slowly taper off of an SSRI and not be

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:52.760
 Not be basically overloaded with this this product serotonin one of their effects

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:54.680
 tends to

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.920
 increase the stress hormones and so an

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.640
 anti-stress program

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:04.320
 I've known people to withdraw from

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:07.200
 several different

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.800
 addictive things including the SSRIs

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:13.760
 using progesterone and coffee and

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.640
 thyroid and a good

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.400
 high calcium diet for example

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:22.320
 How long have you been using it for?

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:26.960
 Many years yeah, yeah, I mean obviously it's

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:32.480
 It's unfortunate. We're getting so close to the top of the hour and the end of the show but in terms of

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:40.800
 It's used for the treatment of anxiety and depression etc etc and all the label recommendations that are given for prescribing it in the first place

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.480
 in terms of your headspace and

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:51.940
 Where you are and what you engage with what stimulates you or what or what you know upsets you even?

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.360
 there's certainly

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.960
 Scope there for

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.160
 You know lifestyle changes, but as dr.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:05.280
 Peat's mentioned you know in terms of anti-stress things there are certainly components that in your diet are

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:10.000
 anti-stress and that support your thyroid and are anti-inflammatory and

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.080
 Decrease the quote-unquote stress which is on you know

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:25.320
 Like lifestyle changes that like go out and run or walk in a day. No. We're not running for sure but in terms of

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:31.300
 Gentle weight-bearing exercise and walking and reading and being in the sunlight

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:37.260
 You know or in a bright room making sure you've got exposure to that good red light etc etc especially in the winter now

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:40.820
 We're coming with a long day long nights and short days and the whole

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:45.460
 seasonal affective disorder being a fairly widespread thing in this part of the world as

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.040
 Thyroid gets low as the winter's coming

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:53.840
 This thyroid hormone, and then there's opposing your estrogen as a female which undoubtedly will have a beneficial effect

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.840
 Keeping up vitamin D. Yeah

00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:00.320
 Hormone replacement therapy

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.800
 No, not a big

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:07.840
 Good of hormone replacement therapy well the only hormone would be progesterone to oppose your estrogen that

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:13.440
 If you're on any kind of hormone replacement, that's estrogen based, and you really don't want to be doing that

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:20.100
 It's it's completely not what you're gonna hear from your doctor perhaps you know or maybe some

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.960
 naturopath who's a little more

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.200
 current

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:28.880
 Mm-hmm yeah, I don't even have a clock in front of me. What what time is it Michael I?

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:36.760
 Guess it's that time. I'm afraid we got a little music where you yeah, I mean you've got a minute to say goodbye to dr.

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:39.060
 Yeah, all right. Thank you so much dr. Peat for joining us

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:48.280

 I've got plenty of well-written articles that fully backed up by

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:23.920
 Studies that you can just go ahead and look at on the internet so people want alternatives. They want some hope

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.480
 definitely a good thing to have and

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:33.880
 Very positive there's lots of alternatives, so don't have to be forced down one particular way to do something anyway until

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:37.240
 Next month. Oh, I just wanted to mention that in January

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.040
 Sarah will be back

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:47.440
 For all those people all those people who keep saying where's Sarah where's Sarah anyway? Thanks so much for joining until next month
