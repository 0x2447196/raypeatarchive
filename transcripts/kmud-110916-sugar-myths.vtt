 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 My name is Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 Well, for those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 they run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 We're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 or which are sourced from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMU DeGarboville 91.1 FM,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

 you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic, a mixed topic perhaps,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 or a topic about sugar. Sugar is good for you.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 All right. OK, so the number here if you live in the area is 923 3911,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 That's 1-800-568-3723.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 We can also be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBMO

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 for further questions during normal business hours, Monday through Friday.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Well, once again, we're very pleased and very excited to have Dr. Raymond Peat

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 join us on the show and share his years of wisdom and research

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 to help us understand the erroneous statements that the medical industry

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 and the scientific community make that are so easily fool us

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 into believing that what they're saying is true.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 It's not always the case, and we want to dedicate this next 30 minutes at least,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 or longer, to exposing some of the myths about sugar,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 and especially the myths about the link between sugar, obesity,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 and diabetes and heart disease.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 And there's another, Dr. Ufe Ravinskov, who's produced many books,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 one of which is "The Cholesterol Myths."

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 And the cholesterol myths, I know we're talking about sugar,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 but the whole link between sugar and lipids and the general obesity

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 and heart disease epidemic that we've seen all around the world,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 there's definite links between the two.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Dr. Peat will bring those out and show how erroneous

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 some of the statements about sugar have been.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 So, Dr. Peat, are you there?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Yes.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Okay, thank you for joining us once again.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 As always, we may have new listeners who've never heard the show

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 or maybe never heard you, so I'd appreciate it if you would let people know

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 your scientific background.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Oh, I guess I started basically when I started in graduate school.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 I had been reading on my own, but I decided to study physiology

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 in the biology department at the University of Oregon in 1968.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 And since then I've been pretty much full-time working in physiology-related things.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Reproductive endocrinology was what I did my dissertation on,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 how oxidative metabolism interacts with aging, estrogen, and so on,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 to regulate fertility and sterility.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Part of that thesis work was it involved the aging of metabolism

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 and how oxygen came to be wasted more and more with aging

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 or under the influence of stress or high estrogen.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And the age pigment lipofuscin was one of the things that I found was involved

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 in high estrogen and aging or stress or radiation damage.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 And lipofuscin is a breakdown product of polyunsaturated fatty acids largely,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 with other things bound into little brown lumps in the cells.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 And it consumes oxygen and wastes energy and eventually can kill the cell.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 But its main function seems to be to waste oxygen and energy.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 And those are those little brown spots that people call age spots or liver spots on their skin.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 Yes, they form in the brain, on the skin, everywhere.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 And they tend to get formed faster and faster the more stress you're under.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 And pretty soon, if you're under the influence of unopposed estrogen,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 they can just eat all the oxygen and not leave any for the cell functions.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 And that was what really started me getting interested in the unsaturated fat metabolism.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 I did that dissertation in 1972, and that was the year that John Yudkin published his book.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 I think it was called "Pure White and Deadly" or something, "Pure White and Dangerous" maybe.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 And I read that and was so impressed by his argument that sugar increases blood lipids,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 saturated fats, and cholesterol, that that was what started me on the idea of recommending

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 increased sugar for people who were under stress,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 because I had already become convinced that there was no basis at all for the connection between

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 high cholesterol and saturated fats and atherosclerosis and heart disease and so on.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 And so when I would see someone deficient in progesterone, having too much estrogen and age pigment,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 they would often recover if they could increase their cholesterol production.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 And the simplest way to do that was to have them eat some extra sugar.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 And that started me seeing the therapeutic possibilities of sugar.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 But from there I worked backwards, understanding where the lipid hypothesis had come from,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 and especially the doctrine that essential fatty acids are essential nutritionally.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 And since they're what lipofuscin is made from,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 it seemed increasingly important to understand how that theory came about.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 I saw that George and Mildred Burr were the ones who had created that idea in 1929 and '30.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 And in their experiment, they didn't at that time know about most of the essential nutrients, vitamins and minerals,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 and so they fed what they thought was a complete diet.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 And when they eliminated the linoleic and related so-called essential fatty acids,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 their animals developed skin symptoms and various things that they called the Burr disease.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 And their diet consisted to purify it so they could put in only the nutrients that were known in 1929.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 They used a high sugar content, a little starch and protein casein that had been highly purified.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 They recrystallized the sugar and precipitated the casein to eliminate all vitamins and minerals from it,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 and then added what they thought were the essential nutrients.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 So the animals, when they removed linoleic acid from their diet,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 developed these scaly tail symptoms and so on.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 Three years after that, George Burr put one of his rats under a bell jar

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 and saw that it was burning oxygen at a 50% faster rate than the rats getting the normal essential fatty acid diet.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 And he decided that that was because their skin was leaky because, he said,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 the essential fatty acids create a barrier in the skin, just making this up out of whole cloth.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 But in the same journals where George and Mildred Burr published these ideas,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 those journals had already published articles by several well-known researchers

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 showing that animals are healthier without cats in their diet and lived longer, didn't get cancer and so on.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 But the Burrs just absolutely ignored the counter evidence and just went ahead and published their doctrine.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Their financers supported them, but the world didn't pay much attention to it.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Fifteen years later, in the mid-1940s, Roger Williams' famous lab in Texas,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 University of Texas, had been working on the B vitamins,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 discovering new B vitamins and essential minerals and such,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 and they created the exact diet that Burr had fed the rats, created the so-called Burr disease,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 and then cured it by supplementing them with vitamin B6.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 And so what had happened was that on a high-sugar diet,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 the animals were burning calories 50% faster than normal,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 and on a terribly deficient diet, they got scaly skin, largely because of a vitamin B6 deficiency.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 And the Burrs, that pretty much just ruined their scientific accomplishment.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 But meanwhile, the pig industry had come to have problems with the chemical that they were using to reduce feed intake,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 shut down their thyroid function and make them get fat cheaply.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 And they found that by substituting a high polyunsaturated fat diet, soybeans and corn,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 they suppressed their thyroid just as well as using that toxic drug and make them get fat on a small food intake.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 And the Burrs' essential fatty acids turned out to be what was suppressing the thyroid.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 But at the same time, the seed oil industry was losing its market for extracting these unsaturated fats to use in paint and plastic manufacture.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 And that turned the whole seed oil industry, all the seed products that were used to fatten livestock,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 they found that they could increase the sales of these extracted seed oils by promoting the idea that they were healthful for human consumption.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 They had been hardening them to make margarine, and by promoting their health benefits,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 they could sell them directly as liquid cooking oils and salad oils.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 And to do that, they found that a biological effect was that they lowered cholesterol production

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 or lowered the cholesterol that appeared in the blood, caused it to increase in the liver as a defensive reaction.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 But they created the doctrine of cholesterol as the cause of heart disease

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 and to eat more of the unsaturated fats, even though they knew that they would create obesity as they did in the pig industry.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 They convinced doctors by a huge campaign that cholesterol was found in the wall of arteries that were developing atherosclerosis

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 and that since you could lower the cholesterol in the blood, they argued that you would lower the cholesterol in the wall of the artery

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 and that that would prevent heart disease.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 And Ravenshaw, much later, showed that none of those arguments had any evidence to support them.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 Atherosclerosis didn't have a direct connection to heart disease mortality.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 Cholesterol in the blood didn't have a connection directly with the formation of atherosclerosis.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 And dietary fats, saturated fats, didn't create the cholesterol in the blood.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 But there was a slight backsliding in the ability to sell doctors on the idea of eating unsaturated fats to lower cholesterol.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 There was a study with veterans in which putting them on the liquid oil diet,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 eliminating saturated fats, caused more of them to die of heart disease and a lot more of them to die of cancer.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 So there was some problem with that lipid theory already in the 1960s.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 And John Yudkin came out. He had been doing research since the mid-50s.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 In 1972, he published this book arguing that sugar caused heart disease because it increased cholesterol.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 And already, since I knew that cholesterol didn't have anything to do with heart disease,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 except protecting against it to some extent,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 that was where I started realizing that he was right on the issue that sugar would increase cholesterol in some people.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 But didn't the Japanese come out with a study even just recently, too,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 that showed when they actually took off a plaque, an atherosclerotic plaque,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 it had a cholesterol bandage over oxidized, rancid vegetable oil?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 Yes, cholesterol protects every cell.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 It's increased in the location that's being injured especially,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 but it's necessary for healthy cell division, DNA replication, nerve function, learning.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 It's our most basic anti-stress protective substance.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 Right, so those oxidized vegetable oils were damaging the arterial wall.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 If the cholesterol wasn't there, then it couldn't have stopped the rancidity and oxidation,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 and it could have caused more problems, right?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Yes, and what starts the inflammation in the artery wall and everywhere else

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 is the breakdown of the essential fatty acids into the free radical products and lipofuscin.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 You can extract lipofuscin from every arterial plaque, every degenerative tissue.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 You find the breakdown products, but you don't find fresh polyunsaturated fats

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 because they're unstable.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 They break down quickly, and what you find is the cholesterol that's there repairing the tissue,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 the saturated fats that didn't break down, and the lipofuscin, which is the X essential fatty acid.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 An initial insult.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 So just for our listeners to understand in case they're not aware of what this unsaturated fatty acid is,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 is it's all liquid vegetable oils that are commonly sold and things are fried in.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 It also includes fish oils and omega-3 oils, omega-6 oils, flax seed oil, hemp seed oil.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 All of these are very, very unstable products, and they can go rancid outside the body,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 even if you just have them at room temperature.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Once you ingest them inside your body, then they can go rancid very quickly

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 because we're warm and we're full of oxygen.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 Yeah.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 In an experiment, I put a little clear plastic tube into the cork of a bottle of safflower or corn oil

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 and put the other end in a cup of water, and sitting at room temperature,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 you could see the water being sucked up into the tube as the oil sitting there was just consuming oxygen

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 and becoming rancid, even at room temperature, but it's much faster at body temperature.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 Okay. You're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMUD Garboville, 91.1 FM.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's mixed topic of sugars and the link with cholesterol.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 And Dr. Raymond Peat, endocrinologist, PhD, is here with us tonight on the show.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 So those people who want to question him about anything related or even unrelated to this evening's subject,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 feel free to call in numbers 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 If you're outside the area or if you're local here, it's 923-3911.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 Okay. So, Dr. Peat, sugar, I think it's probably the second most malign substance after cholesterol.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 Well, that's why that guy was calling it the -- what do you call it? Dead -- that --

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 White and --

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 Pure white and deadly.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 Pure white and deadly, and he said that it raised the cholesterol.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 Well, now that they've proven that cholesterol doesn't cause heart disease, and sugar raises cholesterol,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 and that's a good guy. So what else are they saying about sugar?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Oh, that lustig professor at University of California, San Francisco, in his famous lecture,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 uses the words toxic, poison, and evil. Someone counted 18 times in an hour and a half lecture.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 And that was -- he was referring to fructose.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 Fructose, yeah.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Referring to fructose, what the fruit -- the sugar that's found in fruit is toxic, evil, and deadly.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 But since sucrose is 50% fructose, he was applying it to sucrose, too, or the high fructose corn syrup,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 which is almost 50% fructose. And he was saying that it's just like alcohol in being toxic to the liver,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 but that's one of the weirdest things he said because for many years, people have been showing that it detoxifies

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 many things that injure the liver, including alcohol. It can increase almost double the rate of destruction of alcohol

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 and prevent liver damage in the process. But many other toxins are detoxified in the presence of fructose.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 And sorry, our engineer just said, "What about honey?" And honey is mainly fructose, isn't it, Dr. Peete?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 About half.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 Half of fructose.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Yeah. And honey and more purified fructoses have been used to treat diabetes and other things.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 Stomach ulcers, sugar has been used to cure wounds. Like in emergency situations, they have found that when they

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 didn't have antibiotics, they could do open heart surgery and pack the wound with pure white sucrose and prevent

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 scarring, promote healing better than the fancy antibiotics. Honey was used for thousands of years that way to cure wounds.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 I think that's how Alexander the Great prevented his soldiers from having wounds.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 Dying of usually fatal battle wounds.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 And in the 70s, there were many articles advocating the use of fructose in the diabetic diet because it had become

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 economically pretty cheap. So it could be added practically to anyone's diet to improve the regulation of blood glucose.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 But that idea goes back to 1874. Someone showed that it metabolized better in diabetics than other sugars.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 And even earlier, sucrose was used to cure diabetes. 1856, 1857.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 So I wonder again, why is it that the mainstream science, perhaps you can understand why corporations get it wrong.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 Mainstream medicine. Why don't you say that?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 Yeah. Why mainstream medical science? Why does it want to promote the idea that sugar is so bad for you?

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 I think it's this momentum. They're committed to the mistaken cholesterol lipid theory of heart disease.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 And I think Jutgen sort of killed at the scale.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 And all of the ranting against cholesterol and animal fat has just slid over to concentrate on sugar and fructose.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 Okay. Well, for people that are listening, if you have a pen and paper,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 there are some very good scientific reference articles written by a PhD medical doctor.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 The doctor's name is Uffe Ravenskog.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 Swedish. So it's R-A-V-E-N-S-K-O-V. So that's Uffe Ravenskog.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 He's produced about, I looked earlier, I think it was about 10 books.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 He's produced over 80 scientific articles and completely disputing the cholesterol myths.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 And it's just another excellent example for people that are listening to try to get their head around the fact that things come out

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 and they are distorted or they are steered in a different direction by various interests.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 And what we what we hear, what we read, what we're told is constantly kind of reinforced as people keep telling each other the same lie,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 that you've got to be careful to not just take everything you're told as truth, but look yourself and probe a little further to see if that's really the case.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 So this is just another glaring example of where cholesterol has been mentioned as the evil

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 and something you have to use cholesterol lowering drugs to get your number down, when actually it's a very protective compound.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 And I was just very briefly, I was looking at some of the articles around that,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 showing and citing the many antimicrobial protective effects of cholesterol,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 where they used mice in situations where they would basically give them cholesterol or not prior,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 sorry, post-infection, so they would basically infect control mice.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 It's the same with toxins.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 As early as 1915, 1920, people were showing that cholesterol would protect against toxins as well as infectious things.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 And Ravenscroft did some studies on triglycerides, showing that they are also anti-infective.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Okay, Dr. Peet's disappeared.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 Oh, no, I'm here.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Okay, good. I lost you for a little bit there, not sure what happened. Okay, carry on.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 He showed that the triglycerides protect against infective things,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 and other people have shown that they are anti-inflammatory.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 And the low-density lipoprotein and also the high-density that happens if you have extreme exposure to chemicals,

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 your high-density lipoproteins increase, and so they associate with a higher incidence of cancer.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 And we're told that those are the good guys and that you want a high HDL.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Yeah, they're all good in the sense that they are there to protect you.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 When they're in elevated levels, it's showing that there's something else wrong.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 Like if you're low thyroid, you can have a total cholesterol of 300.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Yeah, if you take alcohol or estrogen, your HDL will go up,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 but also if you take chlorinated hydrocarbons and other things, they'll go up.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Like if you work in a dry-cleaning factory, right?

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Yeah.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Okay, but getting back to sugar and the erroneous link then between sugar and obesity and diabetes and heart disease.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 The same thing that Burr demonstrated, his diet, you know, most of the energy was from plain sucrose,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 and his animals respired 50% faster than animals on a normal diet.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 That's been seen over and over.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Fructose in particular, even a small amount of fructose added to a standard diet

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 can catalyze the oxidation of other substances, glucose and fat both,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 but mostly it catalyzes the use of glucose, turning it to carbon dioxide.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 So it helps your cells use oxygen more efficiently, helps the cell respire, which is basically function better.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 Yeah, and that increase is just about 30% to 50% in all of the publications where they've looked at it.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 And the increased CO2 is also very beneficial,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 and that's another erroneous belief or misconception that CO2 is actually bad and oxygen is good,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 but it's actually the other way around, isn't it?

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 Yeah, and experimenters who have given a fructose supplement to diabetics

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 say that they respond just as well or better than people without diabetes to the ability to oxidize fructose and produce energy.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 And one group happened to look at the fructose that's normally present in everyone's bloodstream

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 and compared it to diabetics and saw that diabetics are deficient in fructose.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 They have almost no fructose circulating in their bloodstream,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 and so naturally it would be therapeutic to restore a normal level,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 but since they aren't able to metabolize glucose,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 that's apparently why they metabolize fructose to carbon dioxide even a little faster than healthy people do.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 So that's orange juice and honey for diabetics.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 Yeah.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 And we do have a caller on the line.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 Okay, well let's take the first caller.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 You on the air?

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Hello?

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 Hi, I was just curious. I take Lavazza.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 Are you saying that that stuff ain't no good?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 What was the substance?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Lavazza. It's fish oil.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Oh, well it's better than seed oils because it's so unstable that it pretty much breaks down

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 before it gets integrated into your tissues as much as the seed oils would.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 Okay, so you figure I should just stop taking this stuff?

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 Yeah, I don't know any benefit except temporarily it lowers inflammation,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 but that's by basically poisoning the immune system.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 That anti-inflammatory effect is similar to the anti-inflammatory effect of stress or radiation.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 Oops, we lost him.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 We lost Dr. Pete.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 Dr. Pete, you're not there?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Hello, Dr. Pete? Dr. Pete, oh I'm sorry, there we go.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 Hello?

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 Yes, you're there and your caller's there too, sorry.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 For some reason you cut out.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 So you were explaining that the negative effects of the fish oil,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 or rather the only positive effect was the slight anti-inflammatory effect, the transient.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 Through suppression of the immune system, which is similar to,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 they used to use radiation, x-rays to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 because it suppressed the immune system.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 But it's very pricey.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 But it's pricey because it's suppressing your immune system,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 you risk increased cancer, increased heart disease,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 all sorts of problems later on in life if you use it long term.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Well, I've already had, I still have heart disease.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 I've had four-way bypass surgery, three heart attacks,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 and both my carotid arteries cleaned and seven angioplasty.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 So I'm pretty much at the end of my rope.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 And they gave me this stuff to lower my cholesterol.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 The count was 203.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 That's not high.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 So 203, their reference range is 200.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 So even by medical standards, 203 is not high.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 Is that what it was after you were taking the fish oil or before?

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 That, I just started taking this stuff a couple of years ago,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 and I've been wondering about it because it just makes me sick.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 Right.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 Okay, well, how old are you, by the way?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 I'm 60 years old.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 Okay, well, I know that Dr. Peet is a very strong advocate

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 through plenty of papers that have also agreed that higher than 200 cholesterol

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 is actually better and decreases the incidence or prognosis of dementia,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 Alzheimer's, and other degenerative changes.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 As well as heart disease.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 So you should actually have or be happy that a cholesterol that's over 200,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 between 200 and 250, would be good.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 Well, that's good.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 Now that it's already there, I don't have to work on it.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 Yeah, but the fish oil is not a good idea.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 And what the fish oil does when someone has a cholesterol test,

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 it just measures what's in the blood.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 It doesn't look at if it changes anything in the tissue level.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 So basically, what happens when you take a fish oil supplement

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 and it lowers your blood cholesterol is that it actually gets deposited

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 in other tissues, like you mentioned earlier, Dr. Peet, in your liver.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 And so that's actually not good for your liver because then you could end up

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 with a fatty liver disease.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 Oh, okay.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 Well, I'm going to stop taking it right now then.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 Yeah, make sure that your dietary intake of fats is basically butter, coconut oil.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 And if you're not a vegetarian?

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 And saturated animal fats.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 Those are probably the only good fats.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 Yeah, we use that country crock mostly.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 Is that bad?

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 Yeah.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 That's vegetable oil.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 You don't want to use that.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Anyway, okay.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 Well, thank you for your call.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 If you want to know more about what we're talking about here,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 you can always give us a call Monday through Friday.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 We'll give out the number at the end of the show

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 and also a reference for Dr. Raymond Peet's contact details

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 and the work that he's published.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 Okay, we have two more callers on the line, so let's take the next caller.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 One was a quick, "You say it for me."

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 What about glycerin?

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 Okay, Dr. Peet, what about glycerin?

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 Oh, I'm sort of ambivalent about it because some research shows that it is protective

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 and can work somewhat like fructose,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 but my own experience with it is that it can cause a lot of digestive irritation.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 Okay.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 Yeah, that's a good question I have just before we take the next caller.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 Is one of the protective effects of fructose is that it is non-fermentable?

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 As fructose is non-fermentable?

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 Well, when you eat any free sugar, sucrose or fructose or glucose,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 it is so quickly absorbed in the upper part of the intestine,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 the jejunum gets the biggest part of it,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 and that means that you're not feeding sugar to bacteria

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 because the intestine should be pretty sterile in the upper part.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 Right, okay.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 Because we were just talking to a winemaker who said that if you want to make mead from honey,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 you have to heat the honey in order to break down the fructose,

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 and then you can ferment the product.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Otherwise, honey is not fermentable,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 and that's why it can last thousands of years without going bad.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 I think you have to add water to it to--

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 Dilute it, right, to dilute the sugar content.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 Okay, sorry.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Get in there before the next caller.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Let's take the next caller.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 You're on the air?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 Yes, is this me?

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 Yes, you're on the air.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 I'm very interested in Dr. Peep's attitude towards sugar.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 I have Lyme disease, and when I have any actual sugar, like sugarcane,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 my affected joint hurts immediately.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 I can have honey or maple syrup and it doesn't affect it.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 And I'm also very interested in the relationship between sugar and cancer.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 I've been reading this anti-cancer diet book by a French physician

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 who says that sugar is a great promoter of cancer.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 Dr. Peep.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 Yeah, that's a whole topic in itself.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 If you look at the blood sugar in an animal or person carrying a tumor,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 their blood sugar generally is at least normal,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 and even if they don't eat any sugar,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 they'll still keep their blood sugar at about the same level.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 There have been many attempts to starve a cancer by lowering the blood sugar,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 but the tumor is sending out signals to provide sugar and protein,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 amino acids and fatty acids that it needs to grow.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 And so if you cut off the sugar supply, all it does is send out more stress signals

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 to increase the basically cortisol production to break down your tissues,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 and it causes tissue wasting, the catexia that is the worst feature of cancer usually.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 It is produced by the stress hormones which are converting your protein in tissues

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 and fat tissues into food for the cancer to make up for the absence of sugar.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 One experimenter using to treat tumors of, for example, the leg would --

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 since the circulation could be isolated,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 they put in a high concentration of glucose into the artery feeding this tumor in the extremity,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 and they could get an extremely high concentration of sugar to it,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 and it killed the tumor without hurting the healthy tissue

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 because the tumor has such an unlimited appetite for anything that it will eat itself to death.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 In vitro, if you feed unsaturated fats to cancer cells, they'll eat themselves to death.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 But in the body, the unsaturated fats are under control.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 Other tissues will consume them and be injured,

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 and you can't do anything but stimulate a cancer with the unsaturated fats.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 But with high concentration of sugar,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 the experimenters showed that sugar would be consumed to the point that it would kill the cancer.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 But I'm interested in the fact that sugar makes my affected ankle with Lyme horrible, hurts terribly,

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 but honey and maple syrup don't.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 I find that very curious.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 The sucrose is the main ingredient in maple syrup,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 and the balance of fructose and glucose in honey is approximately the same,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 so it must be the other ingredients that are having the effect.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 Yeah, I find it very strange.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 Well, there are -- excuse me -- there are some minerals in maple syrup.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 I don't know what else is in honey, but there's -- you know,

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 it definitely has more than just fructose and sucrose.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 Yeah, that was one of the things that Yudkin used for his argument that fructose was poison.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 He said that it wasn't the absence of minerals and vitamins in the white sugar that made it poison,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 and he gave arguments showing that he wasn't really any more logical than George Burr had been.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 Yudkin believed that he knew what all of the nutritional requirements were,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 and he said that the difference in the known nutrients between molasses and white sugar were so trivial

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 that it couldn't be that white sugar and white bread were causing nutritional deficiencies.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 It was just that they were poison.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 Well, my parents ate astounding amounts of white sugar, astounding,

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 and they both lived into their 90s in reasonably good shape.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 So I find that very interesting.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 Anyway, thank you.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 Goodbye.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 Okay, well, it's 7:45 here.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 Until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions you may have.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 Our guest speaker this evening is Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 The show is mainly about sugar.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 We'll be diverging into cholesterol,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 and if people want to call and ask Dr. Peat questions about any other related subjects, they're very welcome.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 It's 923, if you're in the area, 3911, or 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 I think we've got two more callers, and the light's going now, so maybe more soon.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 Hello?

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 Next caller. Hi, you're on the air.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 Hi, yeah.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 Okay, what I'm hearing here is there is a difference between fructose and white processed pure white sugar.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 Obviously, I mean, all the medical people are not against fructose

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 because I'm always hearing, even in mainstream magazines about nutrients,

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 eat more fruits and vegetables.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 So fruit is good for you.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 There's no question about that, and the sugar in fruit is good for you.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 Well, there's lots of doctors now saying that even fructose is a poison and you shouldn't have it, and that's what --

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 Well, I've never heard of that.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 Well, that's a different kind.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 But what I do know is that there's a difference.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 I feel differently, it tastes different, and I feel different when I eat something made with just pure white sugar

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 than with honey or maple syrup or, you know, a fruit juice that doesn't have any added sugar.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 It tastes better, it feels better.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 And I think that an overload of white sugar that's pure sucrose without any fructose in it, I think, is the culprit here

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 because I know that there are some metabolisms where insulin will take sugar and especially, you know, plain just sucrose,

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 will lay that down and store it as fat.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 And, you know, that's part of why people get fat when they eat a lot of white sugar and white flour.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 But -- and also, when a person has diabetes and the insulin isn't producing, it can't take care of the sugar.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 So, I mean, too much white sugar seems to stress out the pancreas to where it gets exhausted

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 and can't produce enough insulin to take care of a normal amount of sugar.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 Well, if you're actually looking at glycemic indexes, the glycemic indexes of some potatoes and rice are almost double that of white sugar.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 Fructose, like you said, has a lower glycemic index than sucrose, but sucrose is not the guy --

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 the pure white sugar is not the guy that causes obesity and heart disease.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 Sure, if you eat enough of anything, you're going to get increased weight gain.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 Well, so you're saying that white rice and white potatoes and white flour have a higher glycemic index than white sugar?

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 Yes, some potatoes are almost double, and some white rices are almost double that of white sugar.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 What kind of potato?

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 It just depends what the sugar content.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 Okay, well, I don't -- I do eat some potatoes, but I pretty -- but I stay away from white rice.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 It seems pretty empty. I like brown rice and whole grains and whole grain bread.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 I know that the white -- the white -- simple carbohydrates, white flours and white bread, they're no good for you.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 Well, it's also, too, when you eat -- when people eat white sugar, I mean, who would just -- you can just eat a piece of fruit, right?

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 That's fair enough. That's easy to do.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 Yes.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 But who just sits there and eats white sugar?

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 Well, no, but you can put a whole lot of sugar in your coffee.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 You can put a whole lot of sugar in your lemonade.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 Sugar becomes addicting.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 Sometimes the desire for it increases, and you want more and more and more.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 I think why the fattening effects of sugar has happened is because it's in cakes and cookies

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 and all these fattening foods that actually have quite a high glycemic index besides just the sugar.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 So you're saying if you ate sugar that was not mixed with white flour, it would be -- well, it wouldn't be as highly caloric,

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 but you're saying it wouldn't be as fattening because of the glycemic index either?

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 It increases your ability to burn fat by 30 to 50 percent, so you can eat much more without getting fat.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 Of the fruit, as long as you stay away from the white flour and the white rice.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 Yes.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 So cake and candy, that's worse for you than, let's say, if you had a pie, a fruit pie that you added a bunch of sugar to,

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 but the crust was a whole wheat crust, that would be okay?

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 Well, even the -- I mean, all the grains and starches and beans and all of those starchy carbohydrates,

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 they all have a higher glycemic index than fruits, honey, and white sugar.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:36.000
 So mostly you don't even put white sugar -- you know, unless you add it to your coffee or your lemonade or whatever, you don't --

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 Or your ice cream.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 And what about ice cream? That's mixed with mostly fats. Is that just as bad?

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 Well, no, because there's no starch there.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 So the glycemic -- if we're talking about glycemic index and raising your sugar and causing obesity,

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 it's more the higher glycemic index.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:57.000
 Well, I can weigh pretty fast on ice cream, but it's probably the calories and all the heavy foods and the AGOs.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 It's the fat in the cream.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 But, yeah, if you decided you were going to eat sugar but not mixed with any kind of carbohydrates --

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 I drink orange juice and I eat fresh fruits and I make lemonade and --

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 Well, that's -- I believe in fructose, and I think that's good, although you can overdo anything.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
 I mean, when I drink fruit juice, I usually drink it without any added sucrose,

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 but I dilute it with half water so that I'm not getting too much even of the fructose.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 But there's like 600 calories sometimes in a quart of good juice that has no added sugars from the fructose.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 And one last thing. I know we've got one more caller, so we need to wrap this up.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 But the other thing is that when you have a fruit sugar or any sugar, you should have it balanced with a fat and a protein,

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 so you slow release the sugar so your liver can store it.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 So you can use it for longer rather than a huge spike of sugar that then your body pumps out insulin and then it gets stored as fat.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000
 Okay, so if you have chocolate, that's a good way to take it.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 Well, chocolate doesn't have the protein. Maybe chocolate with a glass of milk.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000
 Okay. All right. Thank you.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 All right. Thank you for your call.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 Just so we can get the next caller in who's been waiting patiently. You're on the air.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 Hello.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 Hi. You're on the air.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 Yes, I'm calling from Eureka. My name is Mike.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 Thank you for taking the call, and thank you to the people there I'm talking to.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 I work with Dr. Peete and Andrew and the ladies.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 Sarah.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.000
 My question is about LP(a), lipoprotein(a) and collagen.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:30.000
 They work on each other. Is there a loss of collagen when the LP(a) is high?

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 And if that's true, how do you lower the LP(a) if you have to, and how do you raise the collagen?

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 And I'll take my answer off the air. Thank you.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 Dr. Peete, did you hear that caller's question?

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 Cut out.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 The gentleman wants to know the relationship between lipoprotein(a) and collagen.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 I think that was the main question.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 Lipoprotein(a)?

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 Yeah, I think that's what he said. LP(a). I think he was getting at lipoprotein(a) rather than...

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 He just said LP(a).

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 I'm presuming that's lipoprotein(a).

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 I don't know. How do you...

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 There is another caller here.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 Maybe he can call back.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000
 Okay, let's take the next caller then.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000
 Yes.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000
 You're on the air.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.000
 Okay. I just wondered if you could verify one thing that I've heard and whether or not it's a myth.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 I've heard that high fructose corn syrup blocks a chemical signal that goes to the brain when you've had enough food to eat or enough to drink,

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 and it blocks that signal, causing people to want to eat more and drink more.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000
 That's leptin that they're talking about.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 What is it? I knew it was... It began with a P, but I couldn't...

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 Leptin. It was an L.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 Oh, L. L-E-P-T-I-N.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 Okay. I can get off and let somebody else on. I'd just like to hear whether or not this is true.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 Okay. I think that came from one of those doctors that was anti-fructose-lustig.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:28.000
 The pharmaceutical industry was hoping to promote leptin as a natural anti-obesity chemical when they discovered it limited appetite.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:41.000
 But as it has developed over the last 12 or so years, it turns out that it is produced when you overeat, especially on fat,

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 and it's produced by fat cells, especially in obese people, a lot of it is produced.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 And when you have a lot of it and when the brain responds to it, it does shut off your appetite.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.000
 But it also happens to activate inflammatory processes.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:16.000
 And for example, in breast cancer, it's found to be the signal that turns on the cancer metabolism called aerobic glycolysis,

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 where the cancer, even in the presence of oxygen, needs sugar or will burn sugar at a high, inefficient rate.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 So leptin turns out to be one of the means by which obesity causes its damage,

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:43.000
 rather than being some mysteriously wonderful protective molecule.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 It's part of our regulatory system, but in fat people it gets out of whack and causes harmful effects rather than regulatory effects.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 Okay, so it's the bad guy, leptin's the bad guy.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 And it happens that fructose suppresses it relative to other foods.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 Right.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 Okay, well just as an aside, a quick aside,

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 I know most people that are listening to the show are probably way more conscious than to drink artificially sweetened juices or artificially sweetened sodas.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 But with the tend and the fad towards artificial sweeteners as a replacement for good old sugar,

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 there's quite a few nasty sugar replacements out there.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 And very briefly...

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 They're all bad.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 They're all bad, so things like saccharin were shown to cause allergic reactions,

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 and sucralose is a relatively new one, and I won't go through the chemical process that's used to produce it,

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:50.000
 but let's just say that there's nothing else like it in nature and it's not good for you.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 And then acesulfame K is known to be a carcinogen containing methylene chloride,

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:02.000
 so plenty of the alternative sweeteners that are supposed to be good for you because sugar's not,

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 actually very bad for you folks, so don't even think about it.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
 And our engineer has a question.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 I'm putting one in for somebody.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:16.000
 Somebody with hypothyroidism and low cholesterol, what could the link be there?

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 Probably eating too much starch.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 That's the commonest cause of that pattern.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 Fructose in particular acts very much like T3,

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 but both glucose and fructose increase the conversion of the inactive thyroxine to the active T3,

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 and they do several things to increase the thyroid activity, lowering the stress hormones,

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 as well as increasing the active thyroid hormone.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 And the energy provided by both the glucose and the T3 in the liver will give it the energy to produce the

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 cholesterol that's needed if you're eating enough sugar and not producing toxins in your intestine by eating

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 hard to digest, fibrous, starchy foods.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 So they could replace their starchy carbohydrates, their breads, their grains, their beans, their rice,

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:26.000
 with fruits and honey in combination with the protein so that it's not just sugar on its own,

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.000
 and that would help their liver to increase thyroid hormone as well as to increase their cholesterol.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:38.000
 Yes, and all of the sugary fruits come with a very high concentration of potassium

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 and other minerals that help to metabolize the sugar in a safe way so you don't turn it to fat.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 Dr. Peat, I wonder, would you just mention the name again so people perhaps if they're sitting there with a pen

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 and paper they can write it down, get on the Internet, and do some more reading.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 Udkin, you mentioned that gentleman.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 Oh, Udkin, spelled Y-U-D-K-I-N.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.000
 Okay, great. And then we also mentioned --

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
 And what was Udkin for?

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 He was the one that popularized the glucose causes -- or sucrose causes heart disease.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000
 Okay, so that's a myth, his information.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:24.000
 And then the medical doctor and PhD researcher Ufi Ravinskov, R-A-V-N-S-K-O-V,

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 done many, many good works there, looks like the cholesterol myths,

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.000
 one of the larger things that he's done that we are talking about this evening.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000
 Anyway, so unfortunately, I'd love this to go on for longer.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 I always do when you're on the show, Dr. Peat.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
 Thanks so much for joining us again.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 And thank you, Carlos, for calling in. Very good questions.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:49.000
 Okay, so until the third Friday of next month, if people want information on Dr. Raymond Peat,

 www.raypeat.com, a big list of fully referenced scientific articles,

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:04.000
 disputing things that most of us have been brainwashed to believe are not good for us.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
 Go ahead and read it. I mean, it's all there.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000
 You've just got to take some time out and read.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000

 No, that's on October 21st.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.000
 Okay, well, thank you so much. Have a great weekend and see you next month.
