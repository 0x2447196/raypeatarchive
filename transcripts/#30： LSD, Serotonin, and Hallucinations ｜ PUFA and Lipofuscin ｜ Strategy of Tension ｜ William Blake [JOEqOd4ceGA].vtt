WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440
 Okay, we're live. Georgi Dinkov, Raymond Peat, thank you guys so much for joining us. Georgi,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.640
 go back to your question. I won't interfere. Go ahead.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.800
 Yeah, I want to, I mean, it's an expansion to what we've been discussing, but aside from

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.320
 Otto Warburg, St. Georgi, and I guess Ilya Pregogin, do you know of any other scientists

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.880
 who got the Nobel Prize for actually humanistic work, for work that expanded knowledge and

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.240
 science for the benefit of humanity, or does it seem to be mostly awarded for pathological

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.480
 ideas these days?

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.480
 Mechnikoff.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.560
 Mechnikoff, okay. But that seems to be like, you know, you can count these people on one

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.080
 hand and they've been, you know, Nobel winners across a hundred years. So this means a very

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.360
 small minority of good awards, the vast majority of them being mostly pathological discoveries.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.560
 Yeah, and Mechnikoff shared his with Paul Ehrlich, who represented the business monopoly,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.040
 chemical monopoly world.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.720
 Right. Are you familiar with the work of Luc Montagnier, the co-discoverer of HIV?

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.480
 Yeah, I've followed it out in detail, but on and off since about 1980.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.760
 Have you noticed that he's become a pariah in the scientific community because he started

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.720
 talking about HIV being not really as dangerous unless you have a bad lifestyle and, you know,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.720
 low metabolism, essentially. He's talking about curing autism with antibiotics, which

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.880
 of course implicates serotonin. And this guy is now gone. He used to be the director of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.160
 the Posture Institute in Paris. And I think now he hides. He's in hiding. Used to be in

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.240
 Africa, now he's in China, but nobody really knows where he is. And everybody says he's

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.240
 insane.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.080
 Yeah. Much later, you know, when Peter Duisburg questioned, he sort of started the virus gene

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.880
 connection in cancer and money began flowing from the government and the cancer research.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.840
 And then he said, "Wait a minute, I was mistaken there." Went on to other work, and as long

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:09.400
 as he stayed out of the direct interfering with the funding of the nonsense oncogene

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:20.400
 virus work, he continued his research. But then when he questioned whether the HIV retrovirus

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:29.280
 caused AIDS, that was the last straw. Even the other professors at the university told

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:37.360
 graduate students not to attend his seminars or courses, and NIH cut off funding. All of

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:45.160
 the science organizations stopped inviting him because he would be a threat, the risk

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:54.920
 of asking embarrassing questions. Have you heard Kerry Mullis talk about Luc Montagnier

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.400
 and Peter Duisburg?

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.160
 No, no, I haven't.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:09.600
 He was sort of a hyperactive kid who went into science and didn't let his intelligence

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:19.480
 be ruined by getting trained in science. And so he continued to look at evidence and ask

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:28.760
 questions. And once he went up to Montagnier at a meeting and said he needed a reference,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:36.320
 he was writing a grant, said he needed a reference for this statement, "HIV is the probable cause

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:45.120
 of AIDS." And Montagnier referred him to the declaration by the NIH that in fact it

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.320
 is the cause. And Kerry Mullis said, "Well, but there was no evidence mentioned there."

00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:00.280
 And so Montagnier said, "Well, recently someone showed that by treating a retrovirus in a

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.920
 certain way you could get it to kill chimpanzees in a week after you inject it." And Mullis

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:15.120
 pointed out that that has nothing to do with deficiency syndrome. And he said Montagnier

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.120
 just walked away, no more questions.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.240
 Well, it's becoming too dangerous for him to speak, right?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.160
 Yeah, but then 30 years later, the science world turned away from him.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:37.400
 Have you seen some of his other work on bacteria and DNA emitting electromagnetic waves and

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.280
 changing the structure of water?

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:48.360
 Yeah, I haven't looked closely at how they pick up the signals and analyze it, but they

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.720
 say that they're getting signals, sort of an echo in the water, which if people don't

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:04.160
 have a challenge, you have to approximate the measuring system before you can say it

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.960
 simply doesn't exist.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.040
 Yeah, he was actually able to replicate the HIV virus across two different containers

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.880
 of serum. And the second one didn't have any, but it was in close proximity, didn't have

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.720
 any trace of the virus. And he confirmed this with a PCR test. But if the second container

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.560
 was in close proximity to the one that contained the virus, and both of them were in a resonating

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.920
 field of the Schumann resonance frequency, which I think is between six and 10 Hertz,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.160
 the earth apparently emits it, then apparently after about 12 hours, he could actually prove

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.960
 that the second container was able to fully replicate the virus if you give it the starting

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.440
 materials, like if you give it like a RNA and the actual enzyme, I guess, DNA polymerase,

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.440
 is that what it's called?

00:05:51.440 --> 00:06:00.720
 Yeah, that sort of thing has been around, I think it was in 1940, someone was adding

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:10.440
 proteins to different types of cells and finding that the cell could replicate and that the

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.320
 offspring would still contain that protein, and they would do it for several generations.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:28.520
 And one of these was showing that with extreme techniques for removing any contaminating

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.240
 protein, that they would calculate the amount of protein coming out of the cell, and it

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.800
 would be thousands of times greater than the amount of protein the cell had been exposed

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:51.320
 to a foreign protein, and very clear evidence that on a single exposure, a human cell could

00:06:51.320 --> 00:07:00.800
 absorb and copy and produce unlimited quantities of a foreign protein, meaning that it had

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:12.960
 not only copied DNA, it had translated the protein into RNA or DNA, and then used the

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.160
 nucleic acid to produce endless quantities of that protein.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:25.120
 The amount after 100 generations or so, they said, would be thousands of tons of starting

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.040
 material if it had been a matter of absorption and dilution.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.800
 Okay, here's a follow-up, fascinating question related to that.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:39.240
 We as bodies are essentially bigger replicas of these containers that Montagnier was using.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.960
 If two people, one of them HIV positive or carrying any other virus or pathogen, really

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.440
 for that matter, are in close proximity for a sufficiently long period of time, and we

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.840
 are all bathing in human residence all the time because that's what the earth emits

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.360
 as electromagnetic frequency, wouldn't that imply that we could potentially replicate

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:03.240
 the infection into a healthy person without any actual physical pathogen exchanging places?

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.360
 So there's no need for direct infection?

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.480
 I think it works the other way, that a healthy person is going to give the sick person a

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.880
 boost to eradicate the problem.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.360
 I think that's how life has been working all along.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:27.120
 It's not just a little particle of new DNA that they created to make them immune to something

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.960
 in the environment such as an antibiotic, to pass it on to other bacteria to replicate

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.760
 and protect themselves.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.160
 Whether it requires passing a chunk of DNA or simply the information needed to make the

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:50.280
 DNA protein, I think the protective healing effect is likely to be predominant unless

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.440
 the whole system is so sick that it's on the way to dying as a whole.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.520
 So would you say it's a sort of an averaging effect?

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.040
 So if you have more healthy organisms in a community, and then let's say you have five

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.440
 organisms, three are healthy, two are sick, then on average you'll have like, I don't

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.320
 know, three-fifths of a healthy person per person?

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.320
 I mean, I know I'm simplifying it, but because I'm tying this to Cameron's work on seriality

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.080
 and how systems tend to approximate each other and imitate each other.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.840
 So the whole community tends toward like a similarity or an average of a sort.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.320
 So would you say that there will be like a slight decline in the health of the healthy

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.120
 person and a boost in the sick one?

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.560
 Or is it strictly a one directional thing where the healthy people are pulling the sick

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.040
 towards health and it's just a matter of the number of the healthy people you have?

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:45.960
 Yeah, I think there's sort of a ratchet on it in the direction of surviving healthy and

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.280
 superior individuals.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:55.280
 And it requires a sickness of the whole community before you get regression.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.920
 So the reason I'm asking this is because I'm sure, and actually you've said in several

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:04.720
 interviews that we should try to surround ourselves with healthy, positively minded

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.480
 people and that certain people can be really toxic, which leads me to another question

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.480
 I'll ask later on.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.160
 But so if a healthy person is more or less, I don't want to say immune, but if it's the

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.360
 sick people that benefit, then there shouldn't be a danger really if we're surrounded by

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.320
 sick negatively minded people.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.320
 Or is there another mechanism through which they can hurt our health?

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.120
 I don't think so.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:36.080
 If you have, for example, a geographic area where sick people have accumulated because

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:45.160
 of some cultural habits like drug use, then you can have such a sick environment that

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:52.520
 it would take a big infusion of healthy people and there would be social, political conflict

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:57.960
 between the people with the unhealthy culture.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:07.400
 You have to look at the number of people supporting an unhealthy culture and the number of people

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:14.000
 running around obediently wearing masks and behaving stupidly.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.240
 It reaches a point where it feels like it's bad for one's health.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:24.640
 Speaking of that, you know, I was last time we did this, I was in a smaller town called

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.000
 Pichit and we came to Chiang Mai, which is like a bigger city in Thailand.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.880
 And to get to the good grocery store, you have to go into a mall.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.400
 And so you have to put a QR code.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.800
 Right now I think it's kind of voluntary, but you're expected to do it.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:45.160
 A QR code, wash your hands, which I don't do, get temperature checked, and then be screened

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.160
 by a thermal scanner.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
 And that's just to get into the mall.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.840
 And then there's guards on, not like there's people watching people on from each level

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.280
 of the mall.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.720
 And then to get into the grocery store, you're expected to also do a QR code and to write

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.620
 your name down and to get temperature checked.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:12.920
 And so, yeah, it's definitely hitting a reality check point of just total insanity.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:17.200
 And then also I didn't wear my mask or I wore it and then took it off when I got into the

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.840
 store and a woman chased me throughout the store to tell me to put it back on.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.120
 And so I could see how a non-crazy person might be okay with that, but it definitely

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.040
 reduces, it makes me crazy.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.360
 And so it's hard to handle for sure.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.880
 Ray, you guys, both of you guys, DC is...

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.880
 Sorry, go ahead, Ray.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.880
 What was the...

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.880
 No question, just many statements.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:48.120
 But I was just... it was just a realization because the Peachett town was very small and

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.240
 they didn't have these orders to do this kind of stuff.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.320
 And then coming to the bigger city was a realization of what life was going...

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.320
 I guess the TSA-ification of daily tasks.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:06.540
 And the TSA is one situation where it makes my blood pressure go up through the roof.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:11.900
 And so that just sounds like a terrible life and fits into that killer austerity idea that

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.940
 we've been talking about a lot.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:14.940
 Yeah.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:22.700
 Even when people are alone, walking down Freeline Street with no one within 200 feet, wearing

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.220
 a mask in hot weather, obviously suffers.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:33.060
 I don't know, pitiful or something to see such terrible obedience.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:38.500
 Well, don't worry, Ray, because apparently the experts say that protests of up to 100

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:44.020
 people are okay, but social outdoor gatherings of only up to 12 people.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.020
 And then...

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.020
 I mean, it's...

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:51.060
 Aren't they... is the population so dumbed...

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.860
 This is an obvious showing of the hand or something because it's so absurd.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:01.540
 But what do you think the point of them even putting this stuff up, stuff out through the

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.540
 news is?

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.540
 It's so bizarre that they would... these would be talking points on the news.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:14.060
 Yeah, that thing about the 100 people allowed to protest, it shows that if people just ignore

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:19.100
 them, they'll change their rules so that they seem to be in control.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.220
 And since you have a broad, broad view of these types of things, I did want to talk

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.420
 about race a little bit.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:30.860
 What is your... over the course of your life, what is your general perception of how racial

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.100
 tensions get stoked just in your experience?

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:42.940
 I took a couple of into and through the Southern states, 1960 and 1964.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:50.780
 And even though I thought of myself as being a white person, I was for some reason seen

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:56.220
 by the natives as at least as dangerous as a black person.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:03.940
 I'm not sure what it was, but I narrowly escaped getting killed a couple of times, once on

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.940
 each trip.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:10.540
 And I stayed away after the second time for about 30 years.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:22.860
 But I saw it as just the worst sort of sadistic xenophobia.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:31.780
 I can see why black people would shuffle and say, "Yes, if I thought that would have saved

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.740
 me, I might have tried that."

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:40.660
 But something about my face or my manner made them want to kill me.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.740
 Can you go into that a little more?

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.700
 Was it like, were you protesting or was it your friend group or what?

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.940
 Yeah, go into that a little more.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.740
 That's really interesting.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.660
 They just targeted you for some unknown reason?

00:15:54.660 --> 00:16:03.500
 It must've been that I had an out-of-state driver's license and fat sideburns and probably

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.100
 dressed in an unconventional way.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:15.980
 I'm not sure, but you could see the hatred emanating when I would stop at a gas station

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.980
 or something.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:17.980
 I would love to see that picture of you with the fat sideburns.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.980
 Yeah, can we please see those?

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.980
 I would pay to see that one actually.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:34.140
 On those trips, I talked to only one sane person in the whole South who was an Irishman,

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:38.820
 a motel owner, immigrant from Ireland.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.980
 Somehow he was surviving there.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:54.580
 It was a general culture of total obedience to some mysterious standard of being.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.100
 Speaking of the, since we're already on the topic of racism, do you think these protests

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.740
 that are going on right now are actually achieving anything?

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:07.580
 Or do you think that similar in spirit to the MLK movement, because none of these people

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.500
 has been killed yet, we kind of know that it's really just, not that they're, I mean,

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.580
 they believe they're changing things, but really no fundamental change is really happening.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:19.540
 Because if it is, if these people are really putting a dent into the system, people will

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.540
 start dying.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:26.180
 Yeah, they aren't really doing anything threatening to the system.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:31.780
 Getting city council people to say they'll defund the police.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:32.780
 What does that mean?

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:41.660
 That the police will incorporate, privatize, and then be autonomous?

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:47.060
 Somehow the whole system has to be broken up.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:53.420
 Crime has to be recognized when it's committed by police.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:18:01.740
 But the Nazis and Klansmen have infiltrated many of the police departments.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:11.260
 So there is organized racism and classism, wanting to kill homeless people as well as

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.260
 black people.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.940
 In one of your interviews, you spoke about how the Occupy Wall Street movement could

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.620
 have been the, really the real party for everybody, for the majority of the population, but it

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.100
 got infiltrated and manipulated away from making any real demands.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.580
 And there were also snipers ready to take out the real leaders.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:32.300
 Have you seen something similar happening with the current Black Lives Matter movement?

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:44.540
 Yeah, by avoiding the general class question, making it too narrow and things that won't

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.580
 get real continuous support.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:55.420
 A lot of the people that voted for Trump had mistaken understanding about what class is

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.220
 and what really threatens them.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:10.500
 And those people should be incorporated into a reform that eliminates crime in all directions,

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.220
 but especially obliterates the organized crime of the police forces.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.460
 Can we jump back a little bit?

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.900
 You're talking about the police being Klansmen and such.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.980
 Has anything shifted?

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.580
 I would never stick up for police.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:29.380
 I've never met a police officer that I liked or had any positive experiences with them.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.180
 But was there any kind of change?

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:38.300
 Because the dominant narrative right now is that white supremacists are the most...

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.800
 This paper talking about white supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.780
 and contributes to COVID-19.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:50.740
 And then the basic ideas of a white privilege or white savior complex or white guilt or

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:58.620
 white fragility and these terms just being so synonymous with activism nowadays, but

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.980
 it's obviously some kind of overt racism.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:06.100
 And so again, I don't care about defending white people.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:11.060
 I could care less, but it just seems a little bit odd that that is the dominant narrative

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:17.180
 that so-called, using air quotes, "white people" are responsible for all the problems that

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.220
 we're seeing nowadays.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:28.500
 When Martin Luther King began emphasizing the problems of white people, almost immediately

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.380
 that was when he got killed.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.900
 What made it a non-racial, but a class issue.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.020
 Well, I guess that's what I'm getting at.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:43.300
 I don't doubt that there's actual racism for sure, but how is that used to, I don't know,

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:48.860
 occupy the minds of people in favor of not thinking about class and just somebody that

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:53.420
 doesn't know what class is, how would you define that?

00:20:53.420 --> 00:21:08.100
 The simply not possessing property, not having the social power and privilege above the middle

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.460
 income in the country.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:17.020
 People are able to think of going to college and buying a house and so on.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:26.420
 The lower half of the population realizes or should realize that they are in the lower

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:34.940
 class, but they've been taught to call everyone down to about $15,000 a year income, middle

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:35.940
 class.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:49.380
 So just turning the thought process to thinking about will it be possible to have those things,

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:59.900
 to get the education you want and to be secure or will you always be struggling to rise socially?

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:08.580
 What's happening now with the pandemic is clearly designed to destroy all of those people

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:13.900
 who have thought of themselves as the middle class and some of the actual middle class

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.180
 is going down.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:25.020
 As the unemployment rate goes up, lots of small and medium-sized businesses are failing.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:34.540
 If traditional cyclic unemployment was causing hundreds of thousands of deaths by suicide

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:43.220
 and alcoholism and drugs, imagine what the destruction of all of these businesses and

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.220
 jobs will do.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.620
 It will be killing millions of people.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:52.820
 We kind of touched upon this in the last show, but isn't this a bit of a plane with fire

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.900
 on behalf of the powers that be?

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.360
 At some point, a lot of people in this country are armed.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:02.220
 If you push them into a corner, there's no telling what they will do and there's largely

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.220
 no controlling them.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:07.260
 Or do you think they're firmly under control and they will never revolt or cause another

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.820
 civil war or God knows what else?

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:16.940
 The people causing their problems have tremendous security forces.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:23.500
 People like Fauci, you can't even get close to at a scientific meeting to ask a question.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:28.260
 They aren't subject to force of that sort.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:33.140
 They don't have anyone to shoot, despite how many guns they have.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.740
 They're infinitely outgunned.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.860
 So that sort of revolt is worse than useless.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:45.940
 Well, since it's already underway, do you expect sort of like a large-scale kind of

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.500
 collapse here in the United States in the next few years?

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:57.620
 I can't see how it can do anything but get worse until maybe if five or ten million people

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:06.620
 would start rejecting orders and instructions, that might cause a movement that could save

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.180
 the whole country, the whole world.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:13.980
 Do you think the declining population of the young has something to do with the fact that

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.540
 people are so obedient and willing to follow orders?

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.820
 I mean, I'm sure you've seen the news where they say there are studies that have come

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:25.340
 out that say that now a 30-year-old person on average has the same health or bad health

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.940
 as a person who is 60 years old.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.780
 So the young have become the old.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.180
 There's no chronological and biological age.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.500
 So they've basically completely diverged.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:39.740
 You can tell a person's biological age, in other words, health, by kind of asking them

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.740
 how old they are.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:44.540
 These days, you're just as likely to find cancer in an 18-year-old as potentially in

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.540
 a 40-year-old, right?

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.140
 Do you see this as contributing to the problem?

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.940
 Going in that direction, definitely.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:58.900
 The allergies and systemic inflammation is becoming the worst plague.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:05.140
 Young Americans are dying at a higher rate than most other countries from the coronavirus

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:16.860
 because of the background of extreme vaccination, use of birth control and other estrogen, SSRI,

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:22.260
 increasing serotonin exposure, all kinds of pro-inflammatory things make young people

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:29.340
 in this country a lot more vulnerable to relatively harmless viruses like the corona.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:34.340
 There is a horrible video floating around of like an 8-year-old boy and his mom is holding

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:41.740
 his hand and there's two nurses giving him multiple vaccine injections while he's like

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:42.740
 screaming.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.780
 It's really one of the most disturbing things I've watched in a long time.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:52.300
 They only gave him like four or five vaccines, but I know that they need to get many, many,

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.300
 many more.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.540
 But it was just a video that perfectly encapsulated that process.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.380
 One last question about race.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:06.940
 Ray, as a biologist, is racism just like a product of a low IQ individual?

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.420
 Is there a biological imperative to seek out your own type of person?

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:16.820
 No, I don't think it's biological.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:26.260
 Going into a pure indigenous population, sometimes I got off the road in Mexico and I would find

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:32.180
 myself among oddly clothed indigenous people.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:39.620
 They didn't seem unfriendly, but they were definitely puzzled by having such a strange

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.620
 person there.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:45.660
 I think it depends on their experience as a group.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:56.740
 If they haven't been robbed or attacked by foreigners, they just are curious and wonder

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.380
 why you're so different.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:07.340
 But other groups will get together and organize some ways to get rid of you.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:13.940
 I think that's all cultural and based on their group experience and stereotypes that have

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:14.940
 developed.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.900
 Speaking of, I want to finish up the topic of the collapse.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.140
 So what do you think is the end game here?

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:27.140
 You said before it's a streamlined economy so there can be a better chance of competing

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.140
 with China.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.140
 Is that what it's all about?

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.180
 Just competing with the new empire?

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:39.540
 Yeah, bringing the empire rapidly to absolute world control.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:45.180
 And China is the big, massive impediment to that.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:53.500
 So they see China prepared to do a better job of automating everything and increasing

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.580
 efficiency.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:06.500
 So they want to hurt all of the economies and be the only ones who reach the automation

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:17.300
 through artificial intelligence and use that along with some kind of fear to control people.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:24.780
 There might be something other than viruses, but viruses are currently doing the job.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.260
 They'll save us with vaccines.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:35.540
 If vaccines don't work, then they'll require everyone to take some kind of a drug, but

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:40.020
 anything to get people obedient enough to take their treatment.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:45.700
 So do you think China jumped on this as an opportunity as well to even further streamline

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.820
 and put its own population out of control?

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:53.720
 Because they must be seeing through this charade for what it is, but they seem to be going

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.300
 along with it at least partially as well.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:02.020
 Yeah, I think part of that is a matter of sophistication.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:06.420
 Very few people are talking about the germ warfare thing.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:14.140
 It briefly came out in February or March, each side accusing the other of deliberately

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.860
 spreading it to weaken the other's economy.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:25.420
 But anyone who knows the actual history knows that the US has been in the business for the

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.620
 whole 20th century basically.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:35.820
 And so China doesn't want to get in that competition, I suppose.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.540
 That's the only confusing thing for me.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:43.500
 I feel like the war tension with Russia has been being stoked for a long time.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:48.820
 And again, I could be just ignorant, but the China thing doesn't seem like they've been

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.220
 pushing that as hard.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.220
 What was that?

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.220
 Romney and Obama.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.940
 And Romney said Russia was the largest threat.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:01.260
 And Obama said the 1950s called and they wanted their foreign policy back or whatever.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:06.980
 But since the Hillary and Trump in 2016, there's been like a war drum for Russia.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:12.020
 But you're saying there's tension specifically between the US and China, but also the US

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:17.780
 tends to or these search and think groups tends to praise China how they're handling

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.540
 coronavirus and then implementing the changes they've made here.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:25.420
 And so maybe it's like more of a friendly competition or something.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.420
 Who would see it as friendly?

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:34.140
 Again, from just my ignorant point of view, you're saying it's a tension between China

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.420
 and the US of what's happening right now.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:41.140
 Like that's why all this stuff is happening to maintain the dominant empire.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.220
 Yeah.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:48.980
 China's population being so huge relative to the US and the US population is huge relative

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.140
 to Russia.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:57.620
 The real drift of history is strongly in the direction of China.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:07.940
 Now that they've got an efficient economy and a unified government, the population is

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:12.420
 almost a determinant of the outcome.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:18.900
 And so extraordinary measures are needed to change that trend of history.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.260
 And then one last question on this.

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:28.340
 We might've talked about this the first time, but are things declining despite the elites

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.140
 conspiring to do these things?

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:35.540
 Like do the elites know that there is a bad time coming ahead, therefore coronavirus,

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.540
 racial tension, et cetera, et cetera?

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.620
 Or is it totally manufactured by them?

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:51.580
 I heard that Bill Gates, his income has been a billion dollars a week during the lockdown.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.620
 No, I think it's exactly what they want.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.620
 Nothing hurts them.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:01.860
 So if the population is the determining factor, could all other things being equal in developed

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.360
 economies like let's say China, Russia, and the United States, then wouldn't it make sense

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.820
 for the United States as bad as it sounds to do something nefarious to, I don't know,

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:15.260
 decimate China's population, but prop up its own instead of decimating its own population?

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.140
 Or does the empire not really care about the United States as a country?

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:24.620
 It's more like a transnational cabal that can really take a seat and can sort of...

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:32.860
 The industry went to China and so most Americans are useless in the sense of producing profit

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.220
 for the financial class.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:40.980
 And so they aren't going to lose anything if suddenly millions and millions of middle

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:46.020
 class and lower class Americans start dying off.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:53.580
 Their income is going to accelerate for quite a while in proportion to the die off of masses

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:54.580
 of Americans.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:33:00.100
 But, you know, if all the money went to China, in other words, to paraphrase, it's kind of

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.540
 dangerous, don't you think?

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:07.460
 The Chinese government can very quickly nationalize the businesses/profits of these powers that

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.180
 be that just move their operations there.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:11.980
 China doesn't seem to play ball.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:19.420
 Yeah, that's why they don't want to go right to germ warfare because Americans own such

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.500
 a big part of the Chinese economy.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.140
 It's international capital.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.320
 I see, okay.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.820
 So it really doesn't make sense to speak of countries anymore.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:33.820
 It's more like where is the current manufacturing and financial industry concentrated, where

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.580
 it's deriving its profits from?

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.740
 And currently it's not the United States.

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:41.220
 Yeah, that was Trump's point.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:47.500
 The United States lost its essential power and has been living on money manipulation

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.340
 since it exported its industry.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:56.900
 Can I read one quote from William H. Gates, his book, Showing Up for Life?

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:00.980
 He says, "Every corner we've turned in the field of global health, we found that the

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:05.000
 Rockefellers were already there and had been there for years.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.980
 When we committed to childhood immunization, we found ourselves building on the efforts

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:13.180
 the Rockefeller Foundation had helped launch and fund in the 1980s, dot, dot, dot.

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:16.740
 And we learned that such goals are not prizes claimed by the short-winded.

00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:20.580
 The Rockefellers stay with tough problems for generations."

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:25.380
 And so this is just like we talk about, I think of you, Ray, as following in this tradition

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:32.340
 of great scientists, you know, and William H. Gates and his son are following in the

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:36.820
 great or the terrible shadow of these eugenicists.

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:43.340
 And so people think or are trained to think that there's no patterns to any of this and

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.460
 that it's all random and that, yeah, you shouldn't investigate these things.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.460
 Yeah.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:56.180
 Someone sent me a letter they had from some government official denouncing the people

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.580
 who asked questions and suggested fraud.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:03.300
 They said that, "You aren't experts.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.300
 We aren't experts.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.260
 We have to listen to the expert opinion."

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:13.820
 But the trouble is, who picks those experts?

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:21.940
 Mindless crooks are defined as top scientists by the financial world.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.660
 We can move on to health stuff after this.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:29.780
 I did get many requests for us to talk about like the esoteric part of the elite.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:36.160
 And so I have on screen here the Jacob Rothschild with that, the Marina Abramovich women.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:43.960
 And so there's clearly some element of mysticism or like Luciferianism or religious context

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.980
 for a lot of the things the elites do.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:51.240
 And I asked you a long time ago and you said it was more of like a window dressing thing.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.680
 But more of a window dressing?

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:59.320
 I think they're real philosophy.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:10.440
 It's worse than any of the Christian heresies or demonisms and such.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:23.400
 I think it's the belief that they can encode reality and that reality is computable and

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:35.840
 controllable, basically by defining it as a quantized, digitizable something.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:48.200
 In other words, an absolute mentalism or idealism far beyond these little cultish ideas.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:37:00.200
 And it's a seeing of reality as lacking everything that you feel as a living part of experience.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:13.760
 The thing that animals and kids feel, the intrinsic fluidity of being, they believe

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:24.900
 or assert that it is all absolutely at base, nothing but symbols and digitizable symbols.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:34.360
 So everything reduces to isolated quanta of existence and these ultimately are explainable

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.360
 only by randomness.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.080
 So in other words, reality is fully computable, right?

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.080
 Absolutely.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:52.760
 It started being the explicit language in the 1930s and by the 1950s it had become such

00:37:52.760 --> 00:38:02.400
 a religion that people like Norbert Wiener and Vannevar Bush, who believed in an analog

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:11.880
 approach to cybernetics and reality in which all of the in-betweens exist and are meaningful

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:18.840
 and controllable, not just definable quantized units.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:23.800
 Wiener and Bush were just written out of science.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:32.800
 Wiener was ostracized at MIT pretty much the way Peter Guzburg has been at California.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:46.280
 And meanwhile Chomsky represented the vanguard of this mentalistic, Conrad Lorentzian fascist

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:54.240
 view of reality, claiming that you don't need an experience of language.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:02.920
 It could all be dealt with objectively as particles ultimately connected to genes which

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:10.720
 are similar quantized units and you can't experience them, you can infer them.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:21.200
 So everything is abstract inference from symbols to symbols, eliminating all continuity and

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.520
 ultimately meaning.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:31.040
 Chomsky was working for the Pentagon, basically financed by them, creating language schemes

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:39.880
 that would work to give organization and instructions to troops through computers while he was posing

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.960
 as an anti-imperialist, anti-militarist.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:50.680
 He was socializing with top people in the Pentagon, even supported a Pentagon guy as

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.600
 Chancellor of MIT.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:40:01.560
 And Norbert Wiener was going into obscurity because of supporting a holistic view of cybernetics

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.560
 and reality.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:10.000
 So do you think that some of the reasons behind this push to really restrict life and what

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.560
 people are allowed to do and how they're allowed to behave and really the way their consciousness

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.560
 functions, some of the reasons behind that push is because I guess they quickly realized

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:25.200
 that computers are really powerless at emulating intelligence in its full richness and fluidity.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.200
 So they said, well, guess what?

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.600
 We're just going to make people behave like computers and it will be a lot more easier

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.080
 to emulate them and we're going to call it a success because the computer will be able

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.360
 to emulate the human, but the human is no longer a human.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.360
 It's acting like a computer.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.360
 Exactly right.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.600
 It's all authoritarianism put into an ideology of idealism.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:50.120
 I just want to point out that they're standing in front of Sir Thomas Lawrence, Satan summoning

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.320
 his legions.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:56.080
 And I thought I looked at it and it looked, I didn't know who the painting was and it

00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.880
 looked a little like William Blake to me and then I realized it of course wasn't in Blake's

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:07.200
 Satan calling up his legions by Blake is about a thousand times better.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:12.100
 But yeah, and then we don't have to dwell on it, but the Gates implantable quantum dot

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:16.200
 micro needle uses an enzyme called a luciferase.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:20.800
 And so do you think this is like a way of more of a way of control?

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:25.020
 Like didn't Michael Aquino like the temple of set and the temple of Satan.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:30.840
 And so that might, if you tell a person the elite, their doctrine is to do whatever you

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:35.880
 feel like, that's a perfect way to get people on really compromising situations.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:42.960
 Just the fact you can get them to submit to the treatment, everything is over then if

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:48.880
 they submit to it, there's no need to even use the technology because they're already

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:49.880
 victimized.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.880
 I have a question about William Blake.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.920
 In one of your articles, you said that you were teaching some students, all of you, the

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:01.480
 class was reading the poem and then you were asking them what they thought Blake meant

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.760
 and they all gave you like really bizarre answers that you thought were like, because

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.880
 they were damaged by the school system and they couldn't really see what Blake really

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.880
 meant.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.400
 Do you remember that occurrence and what the discussion was about?

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.520
 No, I don't remember the conversation.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:22.760
 Lots of published critics have superficially, Blake used language.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:30.320
 He ironically used the language of the angels by whom he meant satanic powers, but he called

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:34.000
 it the angels inverting things.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:42.720
 And a lot of critics have totally misunderstood what he was saying, totally blind to the meaning

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:49.400
 of what he was saying and thought he was on the side of the angels who he was describing

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.520
 as satanic sadists.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:53.800
 So what do you think he meant?

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.320
 There's a famous quote, what is it?

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.720
 The fox provides for himself, but God provides for the lion.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.720
 That's a very famous quote.

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.400
 What do you think he is referring to?

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.880
 Is it an allegory of some sort?

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.160
 Was it what?

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.720
 Is it an allegory of some sort, an analogy?

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:14.480
 No, no, just the reality is variable.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:23.400
 The lion is governed by appetite and the fox uses cleverness.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:28.480
 The lion is physically more powerful than the fox.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:37.840
 It might have been slightly allegorical, but he didn't have anything against foxes or cleverness.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:54.040
 But he did say that trickery and imposed meanings were used to enslave people.

00:43:54.040 --> 00:44:03.240
 Horses of instruction was another thing, that horses are enslaved and learn their lessons,

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:08.720
 and that's analogous to people who are obedient and do their jobs.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:15.120
 Many mainstream critics seem to portray Blake as a religious fanatic, but my understanding

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:19.240
 of him is that he was actually highly critical of traditional Christianity.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:24.240
 He thought that that's an image of the demons, the church and all of its structure and all

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.680
 the rules that it creates.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.280
 Does that ring a bell as a true statement?

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.600
 Yeah, that's his ironic language.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:36.760
 It was the whole meaning of much of what he wrote.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:48.320
 If you don't see that the angels are Satan in the sense of evil and that the devils are

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:57.280
 the oppressed who have the potential to rebel and save some lives, like the clod and the

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.880
 pebble.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:06.880
 The clod was a person who obediently accepts that God is in heaven and everything is okay,

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:11.440
 and the clod gets trampled all day.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:22.120
 The pebble, who is tough and resistant, takes care of himself and doesn't fall for the orders

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.440
 and instructions and enslavement.

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:30.000
 So in other words, if there is truth, we will have to discover it ourselves, not to be told

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 by some third party, be that God or whoever else is in a position of power.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:41.760
 Yeah, if you have some of the pebble's toughness, you can get through the oppression.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:49.400
 But currently we aren't seeing many visible pebbles in the country.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:54.640
 That's why I thought it's kind of sad because we need pebbles in order to, the toughness

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.000
 of the pebble in order to get through these trying times.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.800
 But at the same time, it seems that the health of the younger generations has been so compromised.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.800
 Things are not really looking up very good right now.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.520
 I mean, there are not many pebbles, like you said.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:13.240
 Speaking of variable reality, I have a question here about LSD and hallucinations.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:17.480
 And they say, is there a relationship between hallucinations and serotonin?

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:23.840
 And just kind of add on to that, are the hallucinations separate from the drug's effects on the serotonin

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.840
 system?

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.080
 And so what are your thoughts on that, Ray?

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:35.080
 The accumulating evidence for the first 15 or so years was very clear that LSD was a

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:38.320
 simple anti-serotonin action.

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:49.400
 That serotonin in overdose can make you crazy and hallucinate, but it's a misery experience,

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.280
 not an enlightenment experience.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:47:03.320
 And the small amounts of LSD that will oppose serotonin on blood vessels and smooth muscles,

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:11.360
 all of the visible systems of the body, LSD is protective against serotonin.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:21.640
 And the stress experience, unavoidable stress poisons you with serotonin, increases your

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:26.760
 tendency to be obedient, to want to be controlled from the outside.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:35.320
 And a little bit of LSD by blocking the serotonin can open a person up, get them out of this

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.640
 digitized world.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:46.280
 There are some interviews with Kerry Mullis in which he suggests that his LSD experience

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:54.960
 helped him break out of the insane science world and see the actual complexity.

00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:04.640
 Even looking at any sort of scientific situation, if you don't start out recognizing and assuming

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:11.440
 the infinite complexity of things, you're going to fall for all kinds of arguments.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:19.200
 All of the mechanisms of science start seeming plausible to the degree that you accept the

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:27.080
 basic idea that the world is reducible to digitized symbols.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:34.760
 And when you see it's a continuous, infinitely complex thing, then you can actually start

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:42.760
 looking at the data as objective data, tremendously complex at every point.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.920
 And every point needs to be pointed in the argument.

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:55.120
 And almost 100% of the so-called scientific literature advances without examining the

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:59.840
 meaning of almost any of their words.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:08.240
 They pile one word and one mechanism on top of the other to arrive at some predetermined

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.240
 goal.

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:15.840
 And they say that's the result of their scientific investigation.

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:21.960
 It's all essentially a kind of authoritarian religious blather.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:27.560
 I feel like a first-year philosophy student asking you this, but if the culture tends

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:34.000
 to increase serotonin and serotonin influences the visual perception, are things maybe at

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:40.000
 a certain level, when somebody takes LSD, are the things they're seeing more real than

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.360
 what a person might see day to day?

00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.960
 Does that make any sense?

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.240
 Very often they are.

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:53.960
 It was the drug industry that caught on to the idea of promoting serotonin and tryptophan,

00:49:53.960 --> 00:50:00.440
 and they wanted to get rid of that LSD idea.

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:08.040
 So they said that if LSD makes you insane, it's because it's blocked your serotonin,

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:17.600
 so you have to increase your serotonin to make your mind work, emotions work properly.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.360
 But it was driven by the drug industry.

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:28.960
 And serotonin is really primarily a stress emergency signal and hormone.

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:34.720
 But if a person takes a large, I don't know what a large, maybe 100 micrograms of LSD

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:39.800
 or something, and they see the world as looking like an abstract painting, is there a way

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:46.120
 – and again, correct me if I'm wrong – but if that is more real than what I am currently

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:52.920
 seeing right now, is there a way to mimic that to some extent, or is that just not possible

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.600
 given the environment we live in?

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:59.920
 A lot of that is the overdose effect.

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:07.440
 In someone like Terry Mullis, they come back from it and realize how flexible the knowing

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.120
 process is.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:19.120
 But just coffee and good health and good experience will duplicate just about everything up to

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.120
 that.

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:27.880
 I think the most important thing that the expanded consciousness does is to realize

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:36.040
 that consciousness extends through both time and space, that you're present in the oncoming

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:43.320
 future as well as the recent and more distant past.

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:52.520
 The digital civilization doesn't want people to experience themselves in that way.

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:59.880
 When you're doing that, when you're experiencing yourself extending through time and space,

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:09.360
 you see a person's arguments and how they're mounting their argument and usually mounting

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:15.840
 it on fraudulent assumptions and concepts.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:24.640
 It helps you ask the right questions, if possible, and not knock their phony structure apart.

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:29.440
 Two questions, one related to LSD and one to consciousness.

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:35.040
 What do you say to people who would bring up studies that show that selective serotonin

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:41.320
 antagonists such as cyproheptadine and ketanserine can both prevent the hallucination trip from

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:45.520
 an LSD and actually can also stop one that is already in progress?

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:53.520
 Wouldn't that give credence to the idea that the trip from LSD is somehow connected to

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.520
 the serotonin system?

00:52:54.520 --> 00:53:03.440
 I think some of the hallucination experiences come from the overdose effect of LSD starting

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:12.000
 to act like ergot and serotonin and constricting blood vessels in the brain, shutting off energy

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:19.320
 production and leading to distortion of perception rather than opening and amplification.

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:23.920
 I see, but the hallucinations are really not necessary for the positive effect of the drug

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:24.920
 to occur.

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.520
 They're just more of a side effect.

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:27.520
 Not at all.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.600
 They're a harmful side effect.

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:35.440
 Well, many people, that's quite a revelation because many people who use LSD, I think a

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:40.520
 significant majority of them, I would dare say, are probably using it specifically for

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:41.520
 the trip.

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:46.400
 They think it's what gives them this religious experience of feeling oneness with the world

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.400
 and the ego dissolution.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:50.440
 But if I'm hearing it correctly, this is just a side effect.

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:55.280
 They're actually the real benefits of the drug for the opposition to serotonin and even

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.720
 much lower dosages would be sufficient.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:00.120
 There's no need to go on a trip to have this benefit.

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:07.280
 Yeah, the range of 10 to 20 micrograms is adequate for expanding consciousness.

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.280
 I see.

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.280
 So, question related to consciousness.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:13.040
 You said that people need to understand that consciousness extends both in space and in

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.040
 time.

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:18.640
 So, would it be a useful analogy to basically imagine consciousness as, let's say, if reality

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:25.320
 is a lake or like a body of water and we throw a stone in it, so then you have these concentric

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.920
 rings of waves.

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:31.880
 So, would it be a correct analogy to say that consciousness is the totality of those waves,

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.840
 not just the place where the stone dropped?

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:39.120
 So it's the waves that you've been making in the past and also in the future that are

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.920
 converging in that central point, but the consciousness is really the totality of all

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.920
 of those waves that are in the lake.

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:45.920
 Yeah.

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.720
 So, the consciousness isn't in your head.

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.160
 It's never in your head if you're conscious.

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.680
 Can you touch on that a little bit more?

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.680
 You should not.

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:59.840
 I think a lot of people describe like they're thinking there's like a frontal sensation

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:05.640
 of, I don't know, presence or being, but you're saying that is not what you necessarily want

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.760
 to feel or you're saying something different?

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:15.240
 Well, feeling, feeling being is a very complex, always changing thing.

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.520
 That's what one wants to do.

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.600
 That actually reminded me of something else I did want to talk to you about.

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:24.160
 I think maybe in nutrition for women, you were talking about feelings in your stomach

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:31.000
 associated with happiness and things like maybe you call it your smile energy or something.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.800
 How much in our present environment are we cut off from these types of things and given

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:37.400
 the specific food supply?

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:44.440
 Do you think maybe the real human condition is much more complex than maybe what a person

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:47.360
 experiences day to day and right now?

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:56.160
 Yeah, your body as it approaches other beings, these feelings from your heart and solar plexus

00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:04.040
 especially, you feel a connection, the sort of thing maybe Luke Montagnier was experiencing

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:07.680
 that when he thought of how particles interact.

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:16.360
 But I think those are actual radiation-like experiences or processes in your organism

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:20.200
 that are actually interacting.

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:26.400
 When you feel that you're interacting through those nerve centers in your body, I think

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.080
 you are in reality interacting.

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:39.360
 There have been lots of experiments showing that sort of thing and that's a very functional

00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:45.040
 part of consciousness that is easily cut off.

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:52.640
 The frown of an authority figure will cause your solar plexus or heart plexus to shrink

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:58.240
 and wither into itself and cut you off from others.

00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:06.600
 The thing of wearing a mask and having spatial distance among other things that's making

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:13.240
 you have a sense of withered biological interaction.

00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:21.840
 So a geometrical spacing of people through a park or building, just a horrible parody

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:25.240
 of the digitized reality that they're imposing.

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:31.240
 So when two people are feeling, when they say, "Oh, I'm vibing with that person,"

00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:35.840
 you're saying that there is actually a very, very objective physical process underlying

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.560
 that feeling that both experience?

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:38.560
 Yeah.

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.560
 Okay.

00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:43.120
 Is it based on digestion or is it based on their consciousness somehow resonating?

00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.000
 Or is it, I guess, two sides of the same coin?

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:54.200
 I think it's a physical resonance of those nerve nodes or plexuses in the body.

00:57:54.200 --> 00:58:01.000
 They are like semi-autonomous nodules.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:09.400
 Each one can interact in its own way, but the whole interaction of the organism comes

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:17.280
 if you have responsive organisms and aren't interfered with by the threat of authoritarian

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.280
 opinion.

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:23.960
 Speaking of resonance, I'm sure, not sure I'm up, you've mentioned Rupert Sheldrake's

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.400
 idea several times.

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:30.360
 He talks about the morphic resonance fields and reality being essentially a superfield

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.680
 composed of many subfields, consciousness being one of them.

00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.720
 What are these fields composed of?

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:38.040
 Is it like ripples in the neutrino sea?

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:40.240
 Is that what the underlying medium is?

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:41.240
 Yeah.

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.160
 Why Horace Dudley's work intrigued me.

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:52.480
 I had been reading Andrea Puharich's things on the magic mushrooms and his organ accumulator

00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.560
 experiments and so on.

00:58:54.560 --> 00:59:04.760
 Puharich was believing that the autonomic nervous system was creating a vortex in some

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:12.240
 kind of an ether that would, in a particular state, it would draw in contact with others

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:15.920
 regardless of distance.

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:26.000
 Michael Persinger sees it in terms of electromagnetic waves, but I prefer the Horace Dudley idea

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.600
 that the neutrino sea is fundamental.

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:33.400
 It's the subquantic medium.

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:39.880
 So do you think Camerer's work on seriality touches upon that even though he viewed it

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.240
 more abstractly?

00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:46.280
 In other words, these waves of similar events that we're seeing, they're just a physical

00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:52.360
 manifestation of those fields, of overlapping fields that Sheldrake is talking about?

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.040
 Who is talking about?

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.040
 Sheldrake.

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:59.900
 So the serial events, the synchronicity that Carl Jung spoke about and Camerer actually

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:04.440
 tried to define more scientifically, they were both essentially talking about the same

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.920
 overlapping fields that Sheldrake sort of defined 100 years later more accurately.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:16.760
 Yeah, I think Sheldrake sometimes lapses over into a slight idealism rather than something

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:23.480
 substantial like electromagnetic fields and neutrino sea under the fields.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:29.160
 Okay, so I've read some of Sheldrake's work and he talks about how a specific group of

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:34.680
 people have a collective memory because of their similarity, whether that's physiological

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.600
 or cultural or whatnot.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:41.320
 So let's say if a person of that, a member of that group learns something, then the rest

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:45.080
 of the members, if they try to learn the same thing, would be easier because they will be

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:50.640
 drawing on that sort of like field that the person has created with their own consciousness.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.020
 Why would this be limited to a specific culture or a group of people?

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:57.320
 Why wouldn't it be a universal field that everybody contributes to?

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:03.180
 I think it's partly the interactions that has a tuning effect.

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:12.320
 People are embedded in the authoritarian culture which has a suppressive dividing effect and

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:20.120
 small groups can create a somewhat private culture that gives them some freedom from

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:32.800
 the big authoritarian process and the authoritarian larger culture, American, European, the historic

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:42.200
 things that have gone on for thousands of years, having some common properties, assumptions,

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:46.840
 those things suppress the biological connectedness.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:57.480
 But when you have a geographical interaction, I think that just like the health interactions,

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:06.840
 when you have a certain visible people around you, that lets you tune into each other and

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:11.160
 momentarily forget the outside interferences.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.680
 I'm sure you're familiar with the ideas of Native Americans about every person having

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.000
 a totem, like a guardian animal.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.480
 But they also, apparently their culture also has this, what do you call it, myth or not,

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:30.760
 doesn't matter, but the idea that you can actually draw on the experience of any animal

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:34.200
 that basically that your group has associated in the past with.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:38.860
 So you can essentially learn, you can teach yourself to behave like a bear, live like

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:41.120
 a bear and even see the world like a bear.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:46.000
 You think the lack of restrictions in those cultures are what allowing people to draw

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.960
 from the collective consciousness that includes both animals and people?

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:57.160
 Oh yeah, I think our real society includes our animal neighbors as well as our human

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:05.600
 neighbors, often more if the animals, the birds for example, birds seem very aware when

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.880
 someone is different from the pack.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:12.680
 They sort of hang around and wonder what's happening.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:19.800
 So doesn't that give a little bit of credibility to the argument that vegans would say, "Well,

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.760
 we don't eat meat because we don't want to eat sentient beings."

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.280
 Of course, it's a little bit duplicitous because plants are also sentient beings, so you have

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.120
 to be eating something at some point.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:34.120
 Don't you think that the moral argument of not wanting to eat animals, doesn't that give

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:37.640
 it a little bit of credibility because those are essentially human, they're not human,

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.120
 but they're beings like us?

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.120
 Of course.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:47.160
 When you look at food cosmically, looking at the nature of cosmic energy produced by

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:54.520
 fusion, presumably, or whatever it is that makes solar stellar energy flowing through

01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:05.320
 substances, the process of nutrition, you should see it in that cosmic dimension.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:14.840
 It happens that the safest nutrition for long life and clear consciousness, unstressed consciousness,

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:21.640
 happens to be fruit and milk.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:29.680
 The milk purifies nutrients and rebalances them in an anti-stress way.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:38.960
 With a selection of fruits, the fruit is designed to nourish its seeds or to feed an animal

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:46.920
 that will distribute the seeds, so the seeds would be unethical to eat and the body of

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:54.080
 the fruit would be an absolute positive thing in the cosmic flow of energy.

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.080
 What about eggs?

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:59.320
 Would eggs be okay in that framework of thought?

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:07.120
 Less ideal, but still no sentient process has developed.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:10.600
 That reminds me of, I think somebody wrote you a long time ago, and I think they were

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:15.640
 contemplating suicide or something, and you wrote them something to the effect of, "You

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.480
 have to realize there's lots of intelligence left in the world.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.400
 It's just not human intelligence."

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.400
 Something to that effect.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.560
 Okay, let's take a mild break here, guys.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.240
 We have, I don't know how many people are watching this at the moment, but give this

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.320
 episode a like.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.240
 Huge thank you to Ray, huge thank you to Georgie.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.880
 These episodes are always super special, so I appreciate it.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:38.440
 Ray, can you just let everybody know how to order your newsletter?

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:42.760
 Oh, email raypeachnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:49.640
 And then I just got the novel flu one a few weeks ago, and so yeah, you're sending those

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:50.640
 out via email.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.800
 I get that question all the time.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:58.760
 Unless you had any more big questions, I guess we could go through some logistical supplement

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.680
 food-related questions, Georgie.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:03.600
 You mean the questions about PUFA and life of fishing?

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.600
 Yeah.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.600
 So, Ray, I don't know.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.760
 I think there's a secondhand quote from somebody else, but maybe you said something to the

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.360
 effect of, "By the time a person is 30, they have enough PUFA to last a lifetime."

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.840
 One, is that accurate?

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:18.320
 And then two, what does that mean in the grand scheme of things?

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:23.080
 It's even more important to keep the total polyunsaturated fat pretty low, right?

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.960
 I don't think I understood the question.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.560
 I guess, so, okay, just this statement.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:34.200
 By the time a person is 30, they have as much polyunsaturated fat in their tissue to last

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.200
 a lifetime.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.200
 So, it's...

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:42.560
 That seems to presume that there's some use for polyunsaturated fat.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:47.160
 I see them as harmful right from the start.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:55.480
 Well-fed, healthy mother, when they analyze a newborn's brain, the conventional science

01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:01.200
 says they're all born with a PUFA deficiency, an essential fatty acid deficiency.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:09.480
 No, that's the healthy, very high metabolizing brain that has been protected against PUFA

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.880
 by the placenta.

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:19.760
 But as soon as breath-feeding stops or if they start using a formula that has added

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:27.600
 PUFA, the brain starts assimilating it, forming esters of cholesterol that accumulate, ultimately

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:34.360
 causing atherosclerosis, but accumulating in the brain and other tissues, slowing metabolism

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:43.720
 so that constantly, as exactly as the cholesterol ester content of PUFA increases, the metabolic

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.040
 rate decreases.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:53.480
 And that, it simply, by the age of 30 or 40, it's reaching the point that it is causing

01:07:53.480 --> 01:08:02.240
 aging symptoms to set in, and it progresses with the onset of a cold brain, Alzheimer's

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.760
 disease and dementia.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:12.080
 The cholesterol ester content of the brain is becoming extreme and blocking metabolism

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.080
 progressively.

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.080
 You're right.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:19.800
 It's like a positive thing, I have the question, but I appreciate your answer.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:20.800
 That makes sense.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.320
 I have a question.

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:28.240
 So let's say somebody's, I read a study that said that when you're eating a combination

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:33.000
 of fats, the saturated fat gets preferentially oxidized while the PUFA gets preferentially

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.840
 stored in the fatty tissue.

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:39.240
 Doesn't that sort of imply that it would be really, really difficult to change your fatty

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.120
 acid composition through diet?

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.280
 Because every time, unless you're eating almost 100% saturated fat diet...

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:55.600
 Under stress, the PUFA comes out preferentially and it increases in the fat cells with aging,

01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:01.760
 but that just means that when you're under stress and you're releasing free fatty acids,

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.920
 they become more toxic the older you get because you have more of them in the system.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:12.640
 But they're also in the phospholipids and cholesterol esters, not just in the storage

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:13.640
 fats.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:20.080
 In terms of displacing that PUFA or increasing the ratio of saturated fat to PUFA in the

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:26.360
 tissues, I think there seems to be more, I don't want to call it more optimal, but the

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:34.320
 longer chain saturated fatty acids like palmitic acid, stearic acid, anything over the carbon

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:38.520
 chain length of 14 seems to be better because these get preferentially absorbed through

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:42.400
 the lymphatic system and they can get to the tissues, while the shorter chain fatty acids

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:46.720
 like those found in coconut oil seem to be quickly picked up by the portal vein system

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.800
 and get into the liver and the liver oxidizes it.

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.320
 So if somebody wants to change their tissue composition, they need to be eating longer

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.640
 chain saturated fatty acids.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:55.640
 Am I reading this right?

01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:01.800
 Yeah, there are quite a few studies showing a longer life in proportion to the percentage

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:09.160
 of highly saturated, completely saturated fats and inverse cancer incidence.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:20.160
 And do you remember the old vitamin E people were finding that the crude vitamin E had

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:26.640
 a stamina increasing effect, but it turned out when they refined it a little more, it

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:35.520
 was the very long chain saturated fats that were providing the protective athletic endurance

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:42.240
 and stamina increasing effect of wasn't the vitamin E, but the waxing material associated

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.240
 with it.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:54.080
 And since refining vitamin E has eliminated those waxy, highly saturated long chain fats,

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:57.800
 the studies of vitamin E are no longer so positive.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:02.920
 Yeah, you mean the polycarcinols, the ones that the Cubans are running studies with for

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:03.920
 cardiovascular disease?

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:04.920
 Yeah.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.600
 So yeah, I remember, yeah.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:12.480
 Those studies seem to abruptly stop around the late forties, the ones that talked about

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:17.360
 the wheat germ oil, the stamina effect of wheat germ oil, and then they purified it.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.240
 They found out it's the long chain fats, the fatty acid alcohols.

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:23.200
 And then the Cubans started doing some research with those.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.440
 And I feel like as soon as the Cubans picked up on that, because they're extracting them

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.760
 from sugar cane, then a whole slew of studies came out in the United States and actually

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:34.480
 in the general Western medical press saying, this is a complete scam.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.680
 These things do not work.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.520
 This is communist science.

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:41.800
 You know, but it seems like this is so strange because the original science happened in the

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:42.800
 United States.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:43.800
 It was just before the 1950s.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.800
 Yeah.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.040
 Science is all about marketing.

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:55.840
 You just shouldn't believe 98% of the things published as science.

01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:02.440
 Everything except some cosmology and some physics, everything else tends to be marketing.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.440
 Okay.

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:07.080
 So would you say that these extremely long chain fatty acids, like the polycarcinols

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.720
 are actually better at displacing the PUFA in the tissues?

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:11.720
 I think so.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:12.720
 Okay.

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:16.240
 Do you have like a recommendation of someone, because they actually, they sell this, assuming

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:19.840
 someone can get it as a pure powder or supplement.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:24.160
 Most of the Cuban studies say just 10 to 20 milligrams a day is enough.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:28.640
 And that seems to be what all those studies with the unrefined vitamin E, that seems to

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.360
 be what a daily intake would provide.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.160
 Do you have any recommendation on specific dosages?

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.920
 I think that's about the right quantity.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.920
 Okay.

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:36.920
 Understood.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:37.920
 Ray, the ketone gut?

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.920
 Well, related to the lipophosgene, but I guess you can ask about the ketone.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:47.600
 I just wanted to go over the ketone body ratio again, because I think that is, I think the

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:55.040
 very dominant alt paradigm right now is keto, fasting, low carb, carnivore diets.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:02.520
 And some of the big proponents in that camp and camps similar, they talk about that fasting

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:06.840
 and ketosis increase NAD relative to NADH.

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:12.120
 And given the ketone body ratio, it seems like, and they'll quote these two papers,

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:17.960
 I should have wrote them down, but that seems impossible given the limited amount of investigation

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.400
 I've done on the ketone body ratio.

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.400
 It's like so clear that any gut...

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:30.440
 All of the best biochemists that I know of showed that diabetes and fasting caused extreme

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:38.920
 reduction of NADH rather than NAD, a shift towards the cancer physiology.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.880
 Is that happening in every system equally?

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:47.680
 Like do different systems compensate when the stress first starts to appear or something?

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:56.440
 I think very bad biochemical technique always messes up the reduction balance analysis.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:10.960
 Glutathione and NADH are so sensitive to conditions that I think in the last 30 years or so, most

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:15.680
 of the work published is doctrine rather than fact.

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.480
 I have a little bit of clarification on that.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:22.560
 I think most of these papers are measuring the NAD to the NADH ratio in the cytosol.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:27.000
 And in the cancer cell, you actually, in the diabetic cell, the NAD to the NADH ratio in

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.800
 the cytosol of these six cells is actually very high because those cells are using pyruvate

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.800
 as an emergency oxidant and they're generating lactate.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:41.240
 But the mitochondrial ratio of NAD to the NADH is actually very low in cancer, diabetes

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.240
 and fasting.

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:47.180
 So I would like to see those papers, where did they measure that ratio?

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:53.740
 Because even the Wikipedia page on the Randall cycle talks about fatty acid oxidation dramatically

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:57.620
 shifting the redox balance towards reduction in the mitochondria.

01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:02.960
 So that seems to be already sort of like commonly accepted knowledge.

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.300
 And some of the ketones so-called are not ketones.

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:17.360
 The beta-hydroxybutyrate, they call that a ketone body, but it's not a ketone.

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:22.520
 And it shifts cell balance the same way lactic acid does.

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:23.520
 It's a reductant.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.800
 And I know you've gone over this a hundred thousand times, but when somebody does benefit

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:36.500
 from a ketosis style of diet, you hypothesize maybe that it's disinfecting their intestine

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:41.600
 possibly to some way and maybe they're changing their food, just better quality in general.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:42.600
 Yeah.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:51.000
 Someone who has been eating pasta and sweet potatoes and so on, if they shift to a meat

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.600
 and egg and cheese diet, their intestine is going to be very happy.

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.400
 And for a couple of years, they all feel great.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.400
 Exactly.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:06.320
 And just to piggyback on that, the parathyroid calcium to phosphorus, that's a moment to

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.880
 moment thing, correct?

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:12.800
 Like if you eat a meal that is higher in phosphorus, that could turn on your parathyroid hormone

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.240
 for the next few hours.

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.240
 Is that right?

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.240
 I think so.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:20.120
 And it's a very good indicator of stress.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:34.920
 And the whole system that turns on aldosterone, angiotensin, renin, aldosterone, that's behind

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:38.720
 the process of increasing your parathyroid hormone.

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:46.320
 And so many kinds of stress will do it, but it happens that high phosphate is very closely

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:52.880
 connected calcium and vitamin D are connected in the other way, protecting against all of

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:57.240
 those pro-inflammatory anti-metabolic things.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:03.400
 So a high calcium diet with vitamin D seems to energize your thyroid function because

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:13.080
 it's getting you out of that parathyroid hormone, aldosterone, angiotensin, inflammatory reductive

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.080
 state.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:17.920
 And you know, vitamin D, I'm sure you're aware there are plenty of studies that try to portray

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.480
 in a bad light.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:24.040
 And some of the older studies show that if you administer high doses of vitamin D, even

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:29.120
 in the absence of increased calcium intake in the diet, apparently it can cause soft

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.120
 tissue calcification.

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:34.540
 Do you think there's any truth to those studies or do you think vitamin D needs a cofactor

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:37.440
 to make it work more safely, like maybe vitamin K?

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:50.040
 A lot of them are confusing 125-hydroxycholicalciferol with the 25-hydroxy and the literature is

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:53.320
 dominated by that confusion.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:18:04.240
 And if you start with cloth-O, the anti-aging protein, you'll see that 25-hydroxy supports

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:14.120
 cloth-O and 125, the so-called active vitamin D, knocks down cloth-O and raises parathyroid

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.160
 hormone and angiotensin.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:25.440
 All of the toxi-degenerative things is done by the activated vitamin D and there's a very

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.680
 massive confusion on that.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:35.480
 I'm talking about active vitamin D as if it's the relevant thing rather than being evidence

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:38.120
 of extreme stress and sickness.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:42.960
 But the 25-hydroxy in the body, I think in the kidney or in the liver, it gets converted

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.240
 into 125-hydroxy, right?

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.960
 So wouldn't taking a precursor like that raise the risk?

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:49.960
 No, no.

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:50.960
 It lowers it in fact.

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.960
 Oh, wow.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:59.280
 So if you put calcium where it belongs, it will, eating calcium and vitamin D will lower

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:07.720
 parathyroid hormone and lower inflammation and raise cloth-O and pretty much turn off

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:15.160
 the activation in the kidneys, which happens in end-stage kidney disease, for example.

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:16.160
 Okay.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.960
 The activation goes wild and kills a person.

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:24.400
 What about the potential risk for hypercalcemia with high doses of vitamin D?

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:29.960
 Do you think that's still tied to that confusion about calcitriol versus cholecalciferol?

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.680
 I think so.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:40.120
 The studies I've seen with very big doses of 25-hydroxy show no harm at all up to a

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:45.880
 million units or something for an extended period.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:49.840
 Just a clarification, I know you've also talked about this before, but cortisol is

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:52.880
 made from progesterone but doesn't increase it.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.880
 And so when people look at those steroid synthesis charts, I think it's very confusing.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:03.240
 And so is there an easy way of a layman grappling with the fact that when you take progesterone,

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.960
 it's not going to increase your cortisol levels?

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:06.960
 Yes.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.200
 Think of the connections as being like a rope.

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:17.560
 If there's a deficiency, there's weight on the rope, it'll pull the precursor along.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:22.120
 No matter how much pressure you put on your end of the rope, you can't push the other

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.080
 end of the rope.

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:30.720
 Those charts have to be thought of holistically and there's no pushing allowed, it's all

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:31.720
 pulling.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:32.720
 That's interesting.

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:37.680
 And then last question for me, the progesterone DHEA ratio.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:41.960
 And so you and I, I don't know, maybe two years ago or something, I was asking you about

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:48.800
 an amount of DHEA to use with a progesterone specifically for male and we had a back and

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:49.800
 forth.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:55.120
 But you don't think that they have to be used in some specific ratio all the time?

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:57.920
 That was, I don't know, you want to talk?

01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:58.920
 Yeah.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:05.880
 If someone is going to blindly use it, it would be a good idea just to have a ballpark

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:16.120
 somewhere in the ratio that you can't poison yourself with DHEA and you can't suppress

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:20.800
 your nervous system so much that you don't make any.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:28.760
 But a lot of people find that they increase their DHEA and testosterone just by taking

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:34.600
 progesterone because progesterone turns off aromatase, for example.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:42.600
 Aromatase tends to waste DHEA and testosterone by grinding it through the estrogen process.

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:49.120
 So wouldn't basically this be a statement in favor of using DHEA with some progesterone

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:54.720
 to lower the risk of it converting into estrogen in a, let's say, hypothyroid person?

01:21:54.720 --> 01:22:03.800
 No, if you don't have any DHEA being produced, it's good to have some in your body.

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:11.960
 So it's very often helpful all the way up for a very old person at 10 or 12 milligrams

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:21.760
 per day backed up with progesterone can be curative, can bring back tissue, connective

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:24.240
 tissue strength and so on.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:31.440
 Both progesterone and DHEA in a really old person can have very powerful restorative

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:39.040
 effects but in a younger person, often the body doesn't have any problem making DHEA

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:46.560
 and the progesterone will just help activate the thyroid and reduce the aromatase and inflammatory

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.560
 processes.

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:52.360
 Well, I guess my question was if someone were to take DHEA, it would be safer if they combine

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:54.480
 it with progesterone, wouldn't you say so?

01:22:54.480 --> 01:23:03.280
 Yeah, because so many people take more DHEA than they really can use in the proper ways

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:11.040
 and so a 30-year-old taking 10 milligrams is very likely to be producing too much estrogen

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:17.440
 from it if they happen to be slightly hypothyroid or deficient in vitamin D or under stress

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.440
 of some sort.

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:19.440
 Okay.

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.600
 I have a question about pregnenolone.

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:26.200
 In one of your articles in several interviews, you mentioned an old study where they fed

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:33.360
 rats the human equivalent of a cup a day and I've been trying to find that study and you

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:37.080
 said that pregnenolone essentially lowered their cortisol back to normal.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:41.200
 Do you remember what year that study was or where it was published or where you saw it

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.520
 because I couldn't find it?

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:48.880
 Yeah, I saw it in a book published I think 1950 edited by Abraham White.

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:49.880
 Okay.

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:56.000
 I mean, Ray, getting some of your references is like an investigation of many months.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.640
 I know you provide a significant amount but sometimes you'll mention something and it

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:05.880
 will literally take me like a year to find eventually.

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:09.360
 Without Sci-Hub, I wouldn't be able to find anything.

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:11.920
 Are you familiar with that, Ray?

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:12.920
 Without what?

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:19.760
 Sci-Hub, S-C-I-H-U-B, basically the pirate website to download articles.

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:21.240
 Oh, okay.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:26.240
 Well, anyways, that's like a huge boon to I think anybody with an active interest in

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:31.120
 this field but yeah, anyways, it's very fun tracking down some of the things you mentioned,

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.200
 finding them in old books and such.

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:37.000
 Let me read through these super chats and then we can wrap this up.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.560
 Linda Bell for $5, thank you so much.

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:39.680
 She says good evening.

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:41.440
 Lisa Ferraro for $9.99.

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:42.440
 Thank you, Lisa.

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:46.320
 Linda, Lisa says, I love these conversations between Ray, Georgie, and Danny.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.320
 Thank you guys.

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.320
 Please keep having them.

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.320
 Thanks for that, Lisa.

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:53.760
 Pure Therapy for $4.99 and he has a dancing GIF emoji.

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.760
 Thanks for that, Pure Therapy.

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:59.540
 Tone, we won't be able to get to questions here because I'd feel bad because we never

01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:02.040
 answer questions on here.

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.840
 For $20 though, thank you, Tone.

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:04.840
 Sincerely appreciate it.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:05.840
 Harry Burgos for $25.

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:06.840
 Thank you, Harry.

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.240
 And Machel for $50.

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.440
 Wow, that's a lot.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:13.680
 And he says, let's not be trodden with cattle's feet, go pebbles.

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:14.680
 Thank you for that, Machel.

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:15.680
 I sincerely appreciate it.

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.240
 And I'll forward these directly to Ray.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:20.520
 Georgie, you have any final questions for Ray?

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:22.000
 One last question on lipofuscin.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000
 Yes.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000
 Go for it.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.520
 So we talked about PUFA accumulation with age and let's say like eating longer chain

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:31.480
 saturated fatty acids can over time displace it.

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:34.240
 But would that take care of lipofuscin, Ray?

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:38.360
 Because my impression from the studies that I've been reading is that once it forms inside

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:41.160
 the cell, you'll have to take some kind of a solvent.

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:44.880
 And there's some studies on potentially vitamin E or even alcohol.

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:47.160
 Drinking alcohol can potentially help with that.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.800
 Yeah, that was interesting.

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:57.080
 They were in nerve cells, they were studying vitamin E's ability to disintegrate lipofuscin

01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:01.000
 and they were dissolving the vitamin E in ethanol.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:07.760
 So they tested plain ethanol and it worked just almost as well as the vitamin E with

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:08.760
 ethanol.

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:14.560
 And that got me interested in its antioxidant action.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:22.080
 It takes something like a teaspoonful of ethanol per day to have a very powerful antioxidant

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.080
 effect.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:33.600
 I learned that in physics and some very sensitive engineering where they are using transistors

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:38.240
 and such need to be free radicals.

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:45.800
 Just a tiny amount of ethanol vapor is a powerful anti-free radical agent.

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:52.200
 So would those be the safest things for potentially dissolving lipofuscin until more is known?

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:56.640
 I mean, a tiny bit of ethanol, maybe like one drink a day?

01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:07.080
 Years ago I saw people who had a fried appearance from so much age pigment and taking progesterone

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:13.040
 within a few weeks their skin looked restored and normal.

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:20.600
 So I think if you turn off estrogen very efficiently, you stop making it and your body can clear

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:22.040
 it up.

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:28.720
 That person that I first saw it happen was in her 40s and I think there's still enough

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:35.880
 good thyroid metabolism going that progesterone could be the catalyst suppressing estrogen

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:40.640
 and shifting the balance away from formation towards elimination.

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:41.640
 Understood.

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:42.840
 One final question.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:49.760
 What is your general opinion of the steroidal, and I emphasize steroidal, aromatase inhibitors?

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:54.240
 Do they have any place in any kind of like a compromised health condition or do you think

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:57.960
 progesterone can offer everything they could and do that more safely?

01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:03.680
 They have side effects and I don't think there's been a great effort to explore why those side

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.040
 effects happen.

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:11.880
 And so I think maybe in 20 years more will be known, but I think they're good to avoid

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:18.280
 and use any of the known very effective anti-aromatase.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:23.160
 Even the angiotensin receptor blockers are pretty effective.

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:30.600
 Lots of things inhibit aromatase, anything that stops the basic inflammatory oxygen deprivation

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:31.600
 process.

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:32.600
 Okay.

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.320
 Final question.

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:39.720
 In one of your recent emails with a person, they forwarded to me, you spoke about eugenol

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:44.000
 and of its potentially, it's like a great spectrum of beneficial effects.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.440
 And I looked at the molecule and it reminds me a lot of dopamine.

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:52.680
 Do you think eugenol has some of those effects on the nervous system, kind of pro-dopamine,

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:53.680
 anti-serotonin?

01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:56.240
 Oh, I don't know.

01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:01.760
 There are some good effects seen with it, but I haven't used enough to really have an

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:02.760
 opinion.

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:03.760
 Okay.

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.760
 All right.

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:05.760
 That's it.

01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:06.760
 I don't have anything else.

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:07.760
 Ray, what are you working on right now?

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:19.400
 I'm thinking about how education is going to be affected by the takeover lockdown mentality

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:27.080
 with people like Governor Cuomo putting Eric Schmidt to work at converting from real education

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:30.200
 to digital education.

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:39.880
 I think some thought needs to be given to how actual real living education might be

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:51.520
 protected against this authoritarian pseudo using digital systems to apply indoctrination

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:52.520
 and call it education.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:56.520
 There were a few requests for us to talk about Jonathan Taylor Gatta.

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:59.000
 I'm sorry, I screwed up the name.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.360
 But maybe we can save that for next time because that is a huge topic.

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.840
 So I'm glad you brought it up.

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:06.040
 Ray, do you have any party words for everybody?

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:09.120
 I think 150 or so people are listening right now.

01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:10.120
 Nope.

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:11.120
 Awesome.

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.800
 Ray, thank you so much.

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:13.800
 These are always fun to do.

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.640
 Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much.

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:16.800
 And we'll be back next month.

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:17.800
 Thank you guys for watching.

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:19.360
 I have an amazing audience.

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:20.360
 We're very fortunate.

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:23.360
 So thank you guys so much and have a safe weekend and we'll talk to you soon.
