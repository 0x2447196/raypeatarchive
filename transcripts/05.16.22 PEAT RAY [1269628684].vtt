00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 From the Hill Country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Well, very pleasant. Good morning to you and welcome back to Part 2 of our show today.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 And we have the honor of talking with a fine gentleman up on the West Coast, up in the Northwest area, Dr. Ray Peat.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Ray Peat has been involved in the healing world for just a very long time,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 way back in the early 80s and doing work with progesterone and hormones.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 He has a PhD in nutrition. Just a wonderful website is RayPeat.com.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 He has all kinds of articles. He has a forum that you can get involved in.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 And very, very well researched. We have a lot of respect for him.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 He talked about the regenerative processes on an evolutionary perspective.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 And then his work with hormones had just been kind of, you know, the real deal.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Dr. Ray Peat, good morning to you, sir. Thanks for coming on our show.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Good morning.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Yeah, nice to have you here.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 We just talked to a doc, kind of a very natural guy, and he does blood work, you know, and he looks at different blood.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 He did it before and after being with people who had been vaxxed.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 And, you know, he actually, he never was much of the idea of shedding, but he actually could tell some different energy released in the blood for some people who were around vaccinated people.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 And I'm wondering, from your perspective, if simply the energetics on a spiritual level or the fear or something like that could create things that we could see in a microscope on blood?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Wouldn't it have to be some kind of a physical thing being transferred?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 We're all emitting pheromones or chemical transmitters on the emotional level.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Sex attractants, for example, are probably fear signals.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Fear signals.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 The whole country, under the propaganda about the pandemic, I would imagine the fear chemical signals are very concentrated.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 So there's a wide variety of results that these fear things could have, even we could pick up from somebody else?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Definitely. They've been studied a lot in insects to use as bait and to use with insecticides, basically.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 But they found out that a single molecule acts as a radio transmitter, apparently, because when the pheromone molecules, say, from a female insect, are covering a space of hundreds of yards or even miles,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 the molecules can't be any closer together than, say, maybe a meter between molecules.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 And there's no way you could tell directionality from just running into the occasional molecule.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 There would be nothing you could define easily as a gradient.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 So they think the sensor cells are tuned like an antenna to receive the signals.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Every molecule is absorbing infrared energy and emitting more or less the same type of energy with some modification.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 The signals are complex enough to carry information.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 The shape of the antenna of the insect, if you've looked at them up close, a moth has this branched, sort of fern-like, sword-shape with side branches.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Those seem to be what are tuned to the direction of the electromagnetic signal.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Humans don't have that extreme sensitivity, but we do have nerve receptors in the olfactory system that definitely connect to our motivational and hormonal system.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 So like in the case of a bee or something, the bee would get into fear over something,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 and they would put out molecules for the other bees to know that you don't want to go over there, and that's how they communicate.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 So these molecules are actually physical, even though the fear may be more of an invisible mental or spiritual thing for the bee?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 Yes, they could be transmitting signals from bee to bee, because when a bee gets back to the hive with new information, they get together and dance in a certain way.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 They've determined that somehow they're transmitting information during that dance, and that includes very detailed spatial directions, exactly how far to go in exactly what direction.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 It's a matter of judgment that the bees that are receiving the information have to believe that it makes sense.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 They don't always take a message for a fact.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 For example, experimenters put the honey bait at different locations and found that the scout bees would give an accurate description of it.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 In some cases, they put it on the opposite side of the lake, and the bees would be okay with crossing the lake in the right direction to find the honey.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 But they then put the honey on a rowboat out in the middle of the lake, and the bee found that and went back and reported it, and the hive bees just wouldn't leave it.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 They wouldn't leave it. Wow.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Some people speculate that the idea of organic honey probably is pretty true. I think they have standards in New Zealand. I think you have to have no chemicals within five miles or something.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 But would it be possible that most honey would be organic because the bees are smart enough not to eat from chemical plant stuff?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 No, they can be tricked and poisoned.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 They can be tricked and poisoned.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Back to the shedding, this idea that we could transfer maybe some kind of toxic material or some toxic energy from somebody who has been injected with these things.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 So this could go on energetically with people depending on what they believe or don't believe about the person or the potential of doing this?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 I think like bees, we are somewhat intelligent about how we interpret the message.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 The information?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 Yeah. And the Pfizer researchers in their manual to the people doing the testing before it was approved warned not to let the vaccinated people be in close contact with pregnant or breastfeeding women.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 Really?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 They understood that the damage could be communicated from the vaccinated person if they were in close contact.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 But these are kind of science, if it's not physical it doesn't exist, but they understand the energetics of this stuff obviously, right?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 They must.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Generally when you say energetic, biologists stop being scientific.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 There has been lots and lots of research for more than 100 years demonstrating radiant communication, ultraviolet and infrared wavelength communication,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 many different kinds of energy, magnetic as well as electromagnetic.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 And still it's a very unpopular area of research. Scientists could ruin his career trying to publish something on it.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 Yeah. So you get out there in Wee Woo land, La La land, and most of the scientists they get frightened, they don't want to mess with it.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 Yeah. In 1968 when I visited some researchers in Russia, one of them gave me a reading list that included some extremely important electromagnetic studies that show a more or less steady magnetic field can be produced.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 A magnetic field can communicate so that just the seepage of water through the ground creates enough current that there's a detectable or a sensible magnetic field that water dowsers can use.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 To find out where the water is.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Yeah. And that's been tested by burying wires and then running very weak currents through the wire.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 So I guess it could be conjectured then all species in a sense are communicating with all other species pretty much all the time.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 Oh yeah. If a molecule can emit a meaningful directional attractive signal, then the whole animal is emitting similar amounts of energy.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 So it's such a small amount of energy that the standard science doctrines about what an organism is, what a cell is, just say that that's not possible.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 Random signals would overwhelm it so that you don't have any possibility of sorting out the signal.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 The sorting and detecting processes are not following the standard biological dogma about how information is transmitted.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 So as you said, all various ways of magnetic, electromagnetic, telepathically, we're just communicating all the time with all things. We must.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Yeah. Did you ever hear of Andrea Puharich or Henry Puharich?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 No. Puharich? No.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 He was doing military and CIA research in telepathy.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Wow.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 And wrote a couple of very interesting books clearly demonstrating the extra-sensory communication.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 And I think there's plenty of evidence to suggest that people who are in fear of something, like a snake or something, and they're really afraid can have experiences with them.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 I mean, there's no accidents, right, with that kind of thing.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Or really want to hurt some kind of species and not have a good experience with it.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 You know, we live out here in Dripping Spring, out in the country, 25 years, and there's a share of snakes around here.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 But I've always kind of talked to them, Doc, and said, "I don't want to hurt you." And I do. I don't ever want to hurt them.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 And you just do whatever you want and we'll just get along.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 And I think I've seen one snake in 25 years, just even seen one.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 I just don't see them.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 When I worked in the woods, usually there were two or three of us, about 100 yards apart, crisscrossing the woods.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 And the people on my group, in a typical day, would see one or two rattlesnakes.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 And during all of the seasons, all of the summers that I worked in the woods, I never saw one.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 You never saw one. You never saw one.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 So you just had this internal kind of feeling. How did you relate to them?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Did you even think about relating to them before that or not relating to them?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 No. But growing up on the desert, I had seen a lot of close-up snakes.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 So you know you didn't have any snake experiences, right?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 Yeah. When I was three, my family was walking around in a brushy part of the Southern California desert.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 And my brother started through a little hole in the brush and backed up and said, "There's a snake in there."

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 And that was the only way through the thicket of brush.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 And I said, "Here's a handful of sand thrown in its eyes."

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 It worked. It turns out that experienced snake handlers use that trick because the nictitating membrane,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 the third eyelid, reflexively closes when they feel sand hitting its face.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 And so they just close their eyes and leave the area.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 They couldn't strike because they had their eyes closed.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 They had their eyes closed. And they just leave. They say, "Let's leave here."

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 Before we take questions and a break, I want to ask you your opinion.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 I was listening to, I think, National Public Radio.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 And you know, enough said about what their motives may be for these kind of things.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 But they did a whole story on how genetics is going to be the thing, right?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 This is what they really are beginning to push aside.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 "We have genetics. And if we can control the genes, then we can control disease. And life will be better."

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 And they had a story about a woman who had some kind of stomach cancer gene.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 And she actually chose to take out her entire stomach so she wouldn't get stomach cancer.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Right.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 To do what to her stomach?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 She took out her entire stomach so she wouldn't get stomach cancer because she had this alleged stomach cancer gene.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 Right. Oh, yeah.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 So, what's your opinion of this genetic stuff? Is there anything, there's nothing to this, is there really?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 This substance?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 Much, much less than they are claiming.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 All of their claims and experiments go wrong and do untold harm rather than any slight benefit.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 If you insert a gene, take out a bad gene or put in a good one.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 So, yeah, it changes the whole system unpredictably.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 The cell doesn't operate in a reductionist way.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 You've upset the whole nature of the being when you change just one part of the DNA.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 And there are different genes.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 There was this famous movie star who had her breast taken off because she had the breast cancer gene, that thing, kind of thing.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 What would it be an indication of? Do you suspect we all have these genes?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 Have you looked hard closely enough?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 Yeah, that gene, also they recommend taking out the uterus as well as the breast.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 Wow.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 But it can cause other tissues to be unstable.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 So you can remove everything that could possibly be unstable and develop into cancer.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Then some other factors are going to be noticing that your body is all fragmented and just taking off some part of your body has unpredictable effects.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Sure. And then why would these little snips even be in some people and not others?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 Could it be things from mom and dad or grandpa or grandpa that are just kind of still hanging around?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 Yeah.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 The habits of the family are charitable.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 Eating rituals, the popular foods, national foods, so that given families will sometimes be eating the same meal generation after generation.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 But it's in no way an indicator of something that you're going to get, right?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 Yeah, not in a very predictable way.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 Yeah. Would it be like in the case of this stomach or breast cancer, could that be used to maybe, I don't know, for any benefit knowing that whatsoever?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 That you had like a stomach or a breast cancer gene like this movie star had? I mean, does it mean anything?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 No, it might mean that you have a special sensitivity to certain things in the environment.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 The fact that the disease caused by a gene typically takes many years to develop, like a person in their 30s is advised to have their breasts and uterus removed.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 And that's what has been happening in all of these 20 or 30 years with no cancer.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 So if you see that you have a gene that they incriminate, all you have to do is change your diet, avoid polyunsaturated fats, maybe use aspirin.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 You can identify the pathways leading from the gene to the cancer and along that pathway during the decades when you don't have the cancer, there are all sorts of things you can do to change the way you develop.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 Interesting. Yeah. It's a very positive way to look at it, like something really kind of good.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 Yeah, we're always modifying our development, either deepening the rat we're in or periodically.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Or getting out of it, right? Yeah.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 So that's a good argument for many cases to let things be and let the body heal, because isn't that, Dr. Peat, what it wants to do is heal? It's always trying to get back in the balance?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Yeah, sometimes the rabbit's so deep, you're not trying very hard.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well said. Dr. Ray Peat is with us. Stay right there, sir.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com. We have a lot of great, interesting emails and we're going to get to them all and we're going to do it after this little word from a couple people that we promote.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 Previously with Brandon Amelani of Shan Blossom talking about our very special ginseng.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 And you don't want something that's been corrupted coming into your body, like the ginseng is a super important example of that.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 You know, when you're using aggressive alcohols and solvents, it has a strange effect with ginseng in the sense that when you're not only over processing it, but putting it in really aggressive alcohols,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 what's going to happen is that you're going to flip the chemistry on some of the androgenic.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Naturally, it's androgenic. It's going to basically protect the telomeres and add life to the body and protect the genetic replication of the cells.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 But it's also going to boost the androgens and boost the male hormones in the body.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 But if you incubate it in a really aggressive alcohol, it flips those to become estrogenic.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 Now, estrogens, phytoestrogens are not necessarily bad in balance, but you really don't want that with your ginseng,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 especially if you're getting like a really high quality, a really old root, something that's very special.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 You want to treat it with care and make sure it's delivering what ginseng has to offer.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 Just a short clip from Brandon talking about the way they do the ginseng, just to give you a better idea of where this company is coming from, the quality and the ethics.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 Brandon and the Shen Blossom link on oneradionetwork.com.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 And this little device also from Mr. Oops, I don't want to do that. This also from I think I can do it here.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 I had it. No, the blue shield. I had it here and then I lost it. Hold on a second. Let me find it.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 Brandon does Shen Blossom and he have a wonderful website. Go on Shen Blossom through oneradionetwork.com if you care to.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 And just check it out and see what they have for you. Hoshu Wu, medicinal mushrooms, some great protein, protein powders.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 Some of the main ingredients in those are bamboo. Have you ever seen bamboo?

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 Other than we take a better choice perhaps than a, you know, than maybe whey or something might be easier to digest.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 And then he does this also, this line called Blue Shield. Listen.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 We're talking with Brandon Amelani and he is the man who brings us the Blue Shield technology to keep us all those little EMFs from doing harm to our body.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 Mr. Brandon, the Blue Shield is a really beautiful little cube, right? That's the main product. And how does this work?

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 Well, the cube essentially sends out signals into the environment that entrain the body.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 So the body is affected by all these electromagnetic fields in the environment.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 And when Blue Shield is introduced into the environment, the body starts sympathetically resonating with it.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 And what we found over 30 years of development is that the body prefers the algorithm, the frequency range, the randomization of frequencies that are exposed into the environment.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 And the body stops attacking EMF or perceiving the EMF as a threat.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 And what this does is it normalizes white blood cell count. And it also starts to reduce inflammation markers from the body trying to attack the EMF.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 So essentially what's happening is the body is basically renormalizing and reallocating immune power to the body.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 And it makes the body stronger and more well regulated.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Good job, Brandon. That's an excellent explanation of how this technology works.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 It's called the cube, the Blue Shield. See the ad on the front page. Use promo code OneRadio for a 10% discount.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 On the third Monday of the month, we have the honor of talking to Dr. Ray Peat, a PhD in biology, University of Oregon, specializing in physiology.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 He taught at the school, University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 Universidad in Nevada, Cudanza, Universidad in, I cannot pronounce, in Mexico.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Wait a minute.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 No, my audio streams aren't. Let's see.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 Two audio streams going? Well, not really.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 So, very interesting fellow that we have the honor of talking to, Dr. Ray Peat.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Dr. Peat, can you conjecture of the difference between what's being talked like and like you did in naturopathic school way back when and today?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Have they progressed a lot with their vision and awareness of natural healing, do you think?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 No, I think the peak of naturopathic thinking was probably a little over a hundred years ago.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 Wow.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 And to gain acceptance, they have accepted a lot of conventional orthodox medical ideas.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 They take the same basic courses and I think have underdeveloped the energetic understanding of the organism.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 The holistic part has been submerged quite a bit by making themselves acceptable to the society that's trained to think in terms of drug curing disease.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 I understand.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 So, even like the Bastier Colleges, and I think that's one of the biggest ones, isn't it, Dr. Peat?

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 Naturopathic colleges, they've somehow got the energy of big pharma or conventional wisdom embedded in them over the years.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 Yeah, just anyone growing up has it built deeply into them that sickness can often be cured by a very specific chemical.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 The old homeopathic idea was largely a scientific holistic understanding that your defensive reactions, your immune system in the general sense,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 that these need to be treated in a very intuitive holistic manner, looking at the whole organism rather than just the sickness.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 The parts.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 From a homeopathic standpoint, are there better ways and there must be the best ways to discern what is the most beneficial remedy for somebody?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 I think a lot of it is intuition.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 Intuition?

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Yeah, some people just naturally, like a dog or a cat, can sometimes sense that a person is developing, for example, epilepsy.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 A dog can sometimes warn its owner that they're about to experience an attack or detect the presence of a tumor and so on.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 A good practitioner starts out with that general openness to who they're dealing with and works from there.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 But you really have to get the right remedy, don't you, in general, to have some real benefit? Just the right remedy?

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Yeah, but the right remedy, many different things.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 When you're looking at the organism as a whole, you find that you can shift the internal balance by little bits of action in different directions.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 Different people can use different herbs or minerals to achieve the same purpose of balance.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 Interesting. So there's no magic bullet kind of thing for anything, right?

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 In general, yeah.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 Okay, let's get some emails for you.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 "When I press down on my foot," writes Robert, "on the skin on my feet or calves, it leaves an imprint very easily, and that imprint stays noticeable for a very long time.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 Would you know what the cause of this might be? Even after holding the steering wheel in my car, there's a very significant mark.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Same thing happens when I press down on my fingertips. Skin doesn't bounce back."

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 So is that kind of like an edema thing going on?

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 In the case of the fingertips, older people, the tissues, there's more connective tissue than juicy, vigorous cells in any part of the body.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 Probably the organism is drying up. If you start with a fertilized ovum with about a 92% water content,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 if you follow all the way through to old age of newly formed tissue, at 92%, with maturation, you're getting drier and drier.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 With aging, there's a continuous dryness of the tissues, so it's literally a degree of dehydration.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 There just isn't the trigger pressure of your tissues to push your skin figure back into position. It takes longer.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 With an animal, if you pull up a piece of skin on the back of the animal, same thing as a dent in your finger that doesn't spring back right away,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 you pull up a flab of tissue on its back, a young animal, skin pops right back into place.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 On the old animal, a piece of skin takes maybe 10 seconds to work its way back into place.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 So it's this idea of what's called aging is a dryness.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 Yeah.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 Dryness kind of a, in Ayurveda, I think it's more of a vata, V-A-T-A, it's a dry, right?

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 Dryness kind of things in elderly. So then that would be, would that be a recommendation then for more water on oil?

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 No, that really doesn't help anything. The factor that regulates the water content is partly the ratio of connective tissues and the type of connective tissue.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 As the glycoprotein content decreases, the tissue has less water.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 If you got too much glycoprotein, as in hypothyroidism, that causes edema, and that causes a different type of,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 a persistent pressure will squeeze the water out of the tissue.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 And if it takes a long time to come back, that's partly because you've worked the water out of the glycoproteins that tend to make the tissue plump.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Hypothyroid skin tends to look young and plump, but it's because it's being retained in this soggy connective tissue.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 It's a different shift that causes the continuing dehydration with age.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 So the normal plumpness, you have to energize them and accelerate the renewal process without developing tumors.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 A tumor, a fast-growing tumor, is very wet, returns to about 90% of water content.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 So you don't want to just mindlessly increase the wetness.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 You have to do it in a deliberate, organized way, raising the energy back to, say, when you're 25 years old, you've got lots of energy.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 You've got both the right amount of glycoprotein relative to collagen to create a connective tissue moisture, but lots of ATP being formed in cells to renew the cells and to renew them at a proper hydration state.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 So then how do we energize the cells and what are the sources of glycoproteins?

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 Good energy is what makes the right amount of glycoprotein.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 Good energy to achieve, or the prana, or whatever you want to call it.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 Yes, and estrogen has the cell-renewing effect, but you have to be very cautious with the effects of estrogen because it will hydrate the cell very quickly and cause it to start growing.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 But that has to be under the control of differentiating things like progesterone and thyroid with proper oxidation.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 What's missing with estrogen is oxidative energy.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 In the skin, if you're deficient in vitamin A, estrogen dominates and will create sort of a dandruff condition.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 When vitamin A is adequate, it suppresses estrogen and increases the renewal and maintenance of cells in the moist state.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 Under estrogen, you get moistness but thinning of the actual vital skin.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 It prematurely turns to the keratinized layer.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 The same thing in your mouth.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 When you are vitamin A deficient, the keratinization makes little white lumps on the cervix of the uterus.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 It's the same thing with leukoplatia from overgrowth of the superficial keratinized cells.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 If you get your vitamin A up, the skin becomes thicker and renewing itself at a better rate but staying vital and functioning in a multicellular layer instead of prematurely reaching that dry keratinized state.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 What are some high vitamin A foods and do you ever recommend supplementing with vitamin A?

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 If you're deficient in vitamin A, you can see very quick effects.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 Every time I had cavities filled when I was 11, 16, 29, something like that, each time I developed leukoplatia on my cheeks.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 By the third time, I had identified that as the vitamin A deficiency from the radiation.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 I found that it totally cleared it up in about three days to supplement a lot of vitamin A.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 Knowing the similarity of mouth leukoplatia to cervical leukoplatia, I told many women about that effect.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 They had been diagnosed as having a precancerous condition that required colonization or other surgery.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 But just using a supplement of vitamin A, the next time they went to the doctor, they had no abnormal tissue on their cervix.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 And high vitamin A foods?

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 Eggs, liver, milk and cream.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 Oh, our faves. Good stuff. That's interesting. Milk and cream and liver and eggs.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Dr. Peat mentioned on a recent show that he had experimented with a lower protein diet and eats oatmeal now.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 Is this entirely due to health reasons, lower methylene, tryptamine, or existing, or is it because he anticipates hard time with food shortages and more expensive animal protein?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 And also something like oatmeal would also be good to store in cases of shortages, I guess.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 Yeah, for years and years I've been thinking of the pro-aging effect of methionine, cysteine, tryptophan.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 The protein in meat.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 And ultimately most of the other amino acids, if you limit your protein, you're going to drastically extend your average or expected lifetime.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 That's interesting. So limit would be just depending on the individual, but having meat now and again as opposed to every day, that kind of an idea?

00:46:45.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 It has to suit your metabolic rate. With aging, the same thing that causes dehydration to develop, at the same time you're slowing your metabolic rate.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 It's the energy production that retains moistness in the tissues, and that high metabolic rate is what you need the protein for.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 And so as your metabolic rate slows, then you're more at risk of suffering from the toxic effects of too much methionine, cysteine.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 I see. So if your thyroid was not functioning properly, that would be a clue that you could suffer from too much protein.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 Yeah. And it just took me years to get around to actually trying that.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 But within two or three days, I noticed my temperature rising, so I didn't need as much supplemented thyroid.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 Oh, and your temperature was rising because? I kind of missed that part. Because you were eating the protein?

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 Eating more carbohydrates.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 Oh, eating more carbohydrates, and your temperature was going up?

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 Yeah, without as much supplement.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 Oh, interesting.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 Question for Dr. Peat. My teen daughter gets severe acne before her period. She doesn't eat salads. She eats low PUFAs and already takes thyroid and Progest-E. What can we do to help her not have the acne for a period of time?

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 Thyroid is the main thing. The right amount of vitamin A to help keep the estrogen under control is very important. Getting enough carbohydrates.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 And for her, getting off carbohydrates?

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 Yeah, fruit juices have anti-inflammatory things. The flavonoids are protective against the effects of estrogen.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 James writes in, "I'm improving my health over time using your pro-metabolic principles. However, decades of being hypothyroid have caused me to look at the world through fear." How would you recommend breaking free from fear?

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 Surprisingly, progesterone and thyroid hormones can very quickly break a person out of that self-limiting fear.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 If a person is having regular/irregular pulse and even transient ischemic attacks, is there anything that can be done to prevent a stroke?

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 I've had friends that were experiencing the transient ischemic attacks and their doctors were telling them to avoid vitamin K and foods that contain vitamin K.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 I recommended that they have their actual vitamin K and clotting factors measured. Vitamin K can be measured as well as the clotting factors that it regulates.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:16.000
 There are two anti-clotting factors, protein C and protein S, that the liver produces under the influence of vitamin K. In a vitamin K deficient person, they are also deficient in those anti-clotting factors.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 The people who ignored their doctor's diet recommendations to avoid vitamin K foods and to actually supplement vitamin K brought their proteins S and C back up to normal and stopped having the attacks.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 Could you ask Dr. Peat about leaky capillaries? How can this be prevented in the elderly and what can be done to heal them?

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 Especially keeping your cortisol and estrogen levels low and under control. Pregnenolone and progesterone and a small amount of DHEA are the direct ways to toughen your capillaries.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 That's where you talked about those two combo, pregnenolone and DHEA. That toughens them up a bit.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 Yeah, and progesterone.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 Oh, and the progeste.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 Here's someone, Dr. Peat, who has an unusually high number of varicose veins, spider veins, young man, early 30s, doesn't eat any grains or processed food. What supplements or things could we do for this?

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 To start with, lots of carbohydrates, adequate amount of protein of high quality, milk and other vitamin A rich foods or supplement vitamin A.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 So when you say lots of carbohydrates, that would be, what is that, fruit and either grains?

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
 Yeah.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000
 Potatoes? That's a starch, right?

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 Yeah, it's a good carbohydrate.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
 That's good.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 Hi, Dr. Peat, what are your thoughts on the polyphenols in foods like blueberries? You speak highly of antioxidants and orange juice, but are the blueberries polyphenols also protecting or can be problematic?

00:53:49.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 No, in themselves the polyphenols are extremely beneficial, but with certain berries you unavoidably get the seeds and the seeds usually have some plant defensive chemical that produces inflammation.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 So if you chew up the seeds of a berry or cook them, you extract some of these harmful factors from the seeds.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 I see. This is from Thomas from Sweden. I wonder if it's okay to pressure cook the whites, those white button mushrooms or otherwise use a lid during the cooking process since I don't really have any good ventilation from removing those unhealthy things being released in the cooking process.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 No, the pressure cooker has a pressure release so you get rid of the toxins in the air and should ventilate your kitchen while you're cooking.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 And you like mushrooms because of, let's see, fiber, right? Kind of fiber?

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 Yeah, they're very good for fiber, but they contain antibiotics and anti-cancer agents.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 Most all mushrooms?

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 Pretty much any kind of the edible mushroom.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 Rachel writes in for Dr. Peat on this Monday, the 16th of May, we're live here. Could you please ask Dr. Peat what happens if Progest-E is not taken in sufficient quantity since it draws estrogen out of the tissues, will it cause a temporary estrogen dominance until it is cleared from the body and what happens if the liver is unable to detoxify it?

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:33.000
 No, the progesterone detoxifies the estrogen in the cell. It inhibits aromatase production of estrogen, it inactivates estrogen receptors and it promotes the addition of glucuronic acid and sulfuric acid to the estrogen in the body.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 It adds glucuronic acid to the estrogen molecule making it water soluble right in any cell where it's both experiencing estrogen excess and experiencing the effects of progesterone.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 You have detoxified it before it even leaves the affected cells. Once it's detoxified and in the bloodstream, it has no estrogen effects and being water soluble leaves through the kidneys without further processing.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:37.000
 Dr. Peat, what could be going on, I don't know, big picture for humans or evolutionary wise, why a little bit of this progestease that you recommend just a dab is good? How did we create this situation? Can you theorize?

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 Oh, it's part of the reason that progesterone is associated with pregnancy is that it is a general protective hormone.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 It opposes the weakening and inflaming effects of estrogen. The process of starting a new life starts with erasing all of the previous information of the apparent organism.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 That's the function of estrogen is to use inflammation and stimulation of cell division to start with a fresh, clean slate.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:55.000
 After this period of erasing and starting over, then to proceed to produce a proper organism, you need to be flooded with progesterone.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:21.000
 A woman experiences a spike of estrogen for a day or two every month and after that has allowed an ovum to mature and be fertilized and implant,

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:37.000
 then progesterone takes over with these about a thousand times more progesterone influence than estrogen when we start off on a new life.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 During pregnancy, it's stabilizing against all kinds of stress, keeps the blood sugar steady, the oxygen steady, and the delivery of all of the nutrients is stabilized by adequate progesterone.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:14.000
 The pregnancy is the crucial time when absolute defense through progesterone is essential.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:35.000
 But at all other times, like in a man's brain during stress, progesterone is our basic protective anti-stress factor. All tissues in both sexes.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:49.000
 Boy, this whole idea of are we reacting to stressful situations, fear, anxious worry, it's just really no telling the effects on the body, is there? It's just pretty profound.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:01:10.000
 Yeah, stress has effects just like estrogen to erase our good functions and reduce things to the minimum.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:33.000
 Hans Selye tested different doses of estrogen and found that the shock stage of the stress reaction, when the maximum stress in effect was identical to the effects of a big dose of estrogen.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
 Wow, wow. What was his name, Hans? I've heard that name before.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
 Hans Selye.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:55.000
 Isn't that fascinating? Wow. Here's one for you. Dr. Peat recommends B6 for diarrhea. I've had mine for a year. Wow. Just ordered and got B6, 50 milligrams, no additional ingredients. Can you please tell me how to take it?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:19.000
 Oh, it's just one of the possible causes, but when a deficiency is the cause, you should see immediate correction of the problem, just one or two days with anywhere from maybe 20 to 50 milligrams.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
 And pretty quickly it'll get there.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000
 Yeah, but sometimes aspirin is all it takes.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:39.000
 What are some of the main symptoms of, say, low, just in general B vitamins? What would be some of the symptoms somebody might look at and say, "Maybe I need some B vitamins"?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:50.000
 Oh, just about everything. Our whole energy and renewal system involves the B vitamins.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
 Do we need then animal protein for B vitamins?

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
 No, plant sources are very good.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:24.000
 Okay. Dr. Peat, there are drugs for asthma that deal with LOX and leukotis. You know what I mean? They seem to work well. This makes me think LOX is more involved in asthma than COX. Do you know why this could be?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
 More than what?

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.000
 More than LOX is more involved in asthma than COX.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
 I didn't hear the last word.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:44.000
 COX, COX, COX rather than LOX.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
 Not getting that, okay?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
 No.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:59.000
 Okay. Dr. Peat says there are drugs for asthma to deal with LOX and leukotrinins. Leukotrinins, L-E-U-K-O-T-R-I-N-S.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
 Oh, leukotriene.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:09.000
 Yeah, leukotriene. Sorry. That seems to work well. This makes me think that LOX is more involved in asthma than COX.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:30.000
 Oh, yeah, it is, but COX is the enzyme that makes prostaglandins, but the leukotrienes are probably the most potent things in asthma.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:46.000
 But reducing the substrate that you make leukotrienes and prostaglandins from, that's the essential fatty acids.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:05:03.000
 So keeping your essential fatty acids at a very minimum or deficient state is really essential to avoiding asthma.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
 Okay. This is from Constantine.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:18.000
 I believe many serious allergies that start in childhood are induced by vaccinations. I believe this is why I've had very serious allergies to milk protein since I was two.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:25.000
 If this is the case, do you think it's possible to get over this, which is often serious enough to warrant hospitalization?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:37.000
 And also, can someone take their dose of NTD once a day with a meal as opposed to synthetic T3, which is better to take spread throughout the day?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
 What was the first?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:49.000
 NTD. Nancy Dog Tom. NTD. I don't know what NTD is, do you?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
 No, I don't know.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:00.000
 So let's talk about the first part, these serious allergies. He says possibly the vaccinations. Can you get over these?

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:29.000
 Yeah. Most kids grow out of a milk allergy, and the things that help you grow out of the allergy are keeping all inflammation lower, avoiding irritating foods, and keeping your digestive system active by keeping your thyroid low.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:46.000
 On the thyroid, does it make any sense to test temperatures other than the morning to see if Mr. Thyroid is functioning well?

01:06:46.000 --> 01:07:06.000
 Oh yeah. You should check it occasionally at different times of day, and there should be a curve rising after breakfast and peaking in the late afternoon and then falling during the night.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.000
 So peaking in 3, 4, 5, down 98.6 and then beginning to fall then again?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:20.000
 Yeah, it's okay to go to 99 or higher in the afternoon.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
 I see.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:37.000
 Trent says Brian Peskin stated that plant-based EFAs would saturate the cells with oxygen, preventing cancer. Based on Dr. Warburg's discovery, can I get Dr. Peat's opinion on this theory?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
 Using what?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:47.000
 Plant-based essential fatty acids would saturate the cells with oxygen.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:57.000
 No, no. They're exactly what is the main blockage to cell respiration and oxygen use.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
 So he's got that backwards.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000
 Yeah, he's selling the idea of polyunsaturated.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:13.000
 Yeah, he has been pesking for years. Why are omega-3 fatty acids so bad with so many studies saying the opposite?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:34.000
 N-6 for about 40 years were absolutely the best thing according to all the studies except a few of them in which they increased deaths from heart attacks and cancer.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
 Except those studies.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:46.000
 It took 40 years to kill the doctrine of the healthful essential fatty acids.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:09:15.000
 And as they were disappearing, the Environmental Protection Agency told the fish processing companies to stop polluting the bay areas and land garbage dumps with all of their fish skin and waste fat.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:42.000
 And right at that time, suddenly with the discovery of N-6, proofed being carcinogenic and heart toxic, and the industry having a problem with the government telling them not to pollute the land with fish oil,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:51.000
 they discovered it was the greatest thing since the N-6 fats.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
 So it became an ideal health food.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
 And when did that start? How far back was that?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:09.000
 The EPA action I think was in the late 70s or 80s.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.000
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us. Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com. We're live here on the 16th.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
 Please pass on these links to everyone that you care about.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000
 Thanks for your ongoing support with looking at some of the products that we promote.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
 And that's how we make our house payment when you make yours.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
 Here's a good one.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:41.000
 Yogis and fakirs say more CO2 is retained in a warm, dry climate. Is there any truth to this?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:11:02.000
 Yes, in the sense that water vapor makes you need to turn over your lung gas exchange faster.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:12.000
 So in a dry climate there's a little difference favoring CO2.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
 In a dry climate there would be a few.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
 But a high altitude is by far the best.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:24.000
 And you hear about the yogis going to a high mountain to meditate.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
 Yeah, right, right.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000
 When we cook mushrooms for a long time they turn to rubber, our teeth bounce off of them.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
 Any way to prevent this?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
 Yeah, grinding the mushrooms.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
 Grinding them?

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
 Yeah, food processor.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
 Oh, so you grind them up first? Oh, afterwards?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000
 My favorite way to use them is mushroom soup.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:02.000
 If you grind them as fine as you can it makes the texture of the soup creamier and increases the flavor.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000
 Also releases more of the beneficial materials.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
 That's pretty fun.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
 Hello Dr. Peat, thanks for coming on Patrick's show. I really enjoy it.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
 From Diane, my skin is turning yellow.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
 Huh, I think my liver is clogged up.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000
 I did one liver flush a couple of weeks ago and passed quite a few stones.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
 That would be, I guess, with the olive oil.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
 I also bought a sauna from Patrick.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
 Well, that helped to detoxify.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
 I have edema in both legs.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
 From the knees down they even started weeping liquid.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
 Wow, so she's got a few things going on here.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
 Yellow and edema?

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
 Yeah, having some blood tests is probably important.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
 What would she be looking for, Doc?

01:12:45.000 --> 01:13:00.000
 All of the liver enzymes would be very important to check.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000
 TSH, to see how her thyroid is working.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
 Checking her body temperature.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.000
 Now, when we do, I guess she said she had stones coming up from her gallbladder.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
 That would be, I guess, the olive oil.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:24.000
 Does that work on the liver as well as the gallbladder?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
 You know, the olive oil thing they do?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
 No, it doesn't.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
 It doesn't?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.000
 It has a mild anti-inflammatory effect if you do it regularly.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:53.000
 But the medical standard for a long time was to use muscle relaxant like atropine or jimson

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:04.840
 weed to relax the duct out of the gallbladder and then take olive oil to stimulate the contraction

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:05.840
 of the gallbladder.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:12.720
 And the combination would let these stones pass through.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.840
 So you mean that's when you would drink, some people drink four ounces or something before

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:17.840
 bed, that thing?

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:18.840
 That idea?

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.840
 Yeah, or at breakfast.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:20.840
 Or at breakfast, wow.

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:30.040
 And there were people over the years who recommended doing a thing called something FOS before you

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.040
 do it to relax.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.040
 Is that the same thing?

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.040
 Do you know what I mean?

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:44.400
 Something FOS, P-H-O-S, I think it was the ingredients in apples.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:53.760
 Where they want you to drink a whole bunch of apple juice before you did the flush.

01:14:53.760 --> 01:15:01.520
 Sometimes they recommend citrus juice, lemon juice, that's to get it out of your stomach

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.520
 very quickly.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:05.080
 Yeah, when you do.

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:10.800
 But is there something, what did you say, Doc, you do before the gallbladder flush that

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:15.080
 is good to do to relax the muscles around the gallbladder?

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:20.160
 The jimson weed.

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:26.680
 It works like atropine, very similar chemical.

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:42.520
 And that 50 to 100 years ago was recognized as very effective and safe, but the atropine,

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:54.480
 partly because the drug culture used it for entertainment, it lost a lot of its medical

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.480
 use.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:59.840
 Do you actually go online and buy jimson weed in like a tincture or something?

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:08.040
 Yeah, just a piece of leaf the size of your thumbnail sometimes was enough.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.160
 You mean just a few days before you did the flush?

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:15.480
 No, right at the same time as the olive oil.

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:16.480
 Wow.

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.480
 Have you ever done the olive oil thing flushed?

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.480
 No.

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:25.360
 No, you never did that.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:34.000
 So let's go back to this person, their liver being clogged up yellow, could that be liver

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
 toxicity?

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.360
 So you'd want to look at the liver enzymes you had recommended to her, right, and see

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:42.360
 what's going on?

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.920
 Yeah.

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:59.120
 If the liver is actually getting blocked up, that requires usually something to make your

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:08.440
 intestine more active and less inflamed, and usually a thyroid supplement goes with correcting

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:11.640
 the liver enzyme excess.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:19.480
 Oh, the question we had on the thyroid, he wrote back and said, "NTD is natural desiccated

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:20.480
 thyroid."

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:24.280
 So let's see what he asked here.

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:25.280
 Okay.

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:31.920
 Let me see if I can find it here.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.960
 Oh, okay.

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:40.400
 Also he said, "Can someone take their dose of natural desiccated thyroid once a day with

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:46.720
 a meal as opposed to synthetic T3, which is better to take spread throughout the day?"

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.720
 That was his question.

01:17:48.720 --> 01:18:01.920
 Yeah, the natural thyroid gland produces when it's digested both T4 and T3, but it contains

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:05.640
 none of those as an actual ingredient.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:13.320
 They're produced by the digestive enzymes.

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:26.600
 So taking it with food, there will be a gradual release of those things, so it doesn't hit

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:34.440
 your liver, for example, as evidence that you're poisoned by an excess of something.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:45.920
 If you take too much T3, even 10 micrograms at once of pure T3 signals to your liver that

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:59.360
 you're overdosed at that moment, and so your liver begins producing the enzyme to break

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.640
 down the T3.

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:11.680
 So if you do that regularly, the liver becomes very active in destroying T3.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:19.960
 That's why it's important to take little bits of it gradually during the day.

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:26.320
 So you mentioned Sinoplus, and Jane said that she has some Sinoplus and would like to get

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.920
 your help and idea how to move forward.

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:32.400
 So Sinoplus, we get it from a Mexican pharmacy, right?

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:37.320
 I think that's the only place you can get it, isn't it, right now?

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.080
 Yeah, that's a synthetic.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:50.160
 With the balance of T4 to T3 that you get from the natural desiccated thyroid plant.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.160
 I see.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:56.800
 So that's why you like it, kind of, because it's a balanced T3, T4, what the body wants,

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:57.800
 right?

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:06.440
 Yeah, but it's present in the pill, so you still don't want to take your whole dose once

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.440
 a day.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:11.160
 You should break it up into two or three parts.

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:17.440
 So that little pill contains how many, they're small, I used to have some.

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:30.440
 The Sinoplus pill contains 30 micrograms of T3 and 120 of T4.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:35.280
 120 of T4, I'm writing this down.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:39.200
 And 30 micro of T3.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:46.120
 It's pretty much equivalent to two and a half grains of old-fashioned armor.

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:48.760
 Wow, 2.5 grains, that's a lot.

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:56.400
 Well, no, it'd be 120, that's 180, right, milligrams.

01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:00.280
 So you'd have to figure out what you were taking on the regular and then kind of work

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.280
 backwards, right?

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:13.840
 Oh, yeah, never take more than, maximum would be a fourth of a Sinoplus, but better start

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.780
 with an eighth of a tablet.

01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:20.840
 And then you would just do an eighth once a day and then work up a little bit to your

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:22.520
 temperature is stable?

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.020
 Yep, yep.

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:33.600
 One of the emails that I get, probably two or three every day, is someone who has been

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:51.100
 told maybe by their bodybuilder expert to take a whole tablet of Cytomel or even Sinoplus.

01:21:51.100 --> 01:22:00.700
 And the syndrome of intolerance to thyroid hormone, there's an epidemic of it right now.

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:02.940
 Repeat that last part, please.

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:13.020
 People telling me that they suffer from a syndrome of hypersensitivity or intolerance

01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:20.500
 to thyroid hormone because they've tried the absurdly high doses that so many people are

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:21.500
 recommending.

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:24.380
 So the body just doesn't take to it, just too much?

01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:25.380
 Yeah.

01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:26.380
 Wow, wow.

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:30.460
 So what was the idea behind the bodybuilders?

01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:32.380
 I don't want to get people in the ideas.

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:38.660
 Why would they possibly recommend that kind of thing?

01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:49.580
 Looking on the internet, if you look up Cytomel or Sinomel, you see all of these bodybuilding

01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:53.260
 people either selling it or recommending it.

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:54.260
 Really?

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:56.780
 Is that the same as Sinoplus?

01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:59.780
 Not quite so much.

01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:05.580
 Not so much, yeah.

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:06.580
 Wow.

01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:10.820
 Yeah, this is way, way long.

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:16.260
 Please, why don't you try to, Linda, try to shorten this down so I can get through it.

01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:25.860
 I just can't read the whole thing, I'm sorry.

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:34.820
 Howie's read to take thyroid on an empty stomach so the food doesn't bind to the thyroid enzymes

01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:37.180
 and lose potency.

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:38.540
 Is that true, Dr. Peat?

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:39.540
 Are they writing?

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:40.540
 They're asking you?

01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:49.460
 Yeah, it's true that pharmacists and doctors have been saying that now for more than 50

01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:50.460
 years.

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:59.740
 But it's true that food slows the absorption, but that's exactly what you want.

01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:01.580
 That's what you want?

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:07.380
 You want gradual absorption because that's most like the action of your body.

01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:08.700
 Oh, sure.

01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:15.260
 It's increasing a little bit every hour, but doctors and pharmacists are thinking in

01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:26.460
 terms of wanting to get, for example, a blood pressure drug or a painkiller drug, fully

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:37.420
 working as fast as possible, and that's the only basis for taking it on an empty stomach

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:38.420
 in the morning.

01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:39.420
 I see.

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:43.420
 It's completely unphysiological for a hormone.

01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:46.900
 Unphysiological, that's great.

01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:48.140
 This is an interesting one.

01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:55.260
 Karen writes in, she's in Los Angeles, with all this talk about abortion and anti-abortion

01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:57.180
 and pro-life and pro-choice.

01:24:57.180 --> 01:25:02.460
 Does Dr. Peat have an opinion of when soul comes into the body?

01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:04.300
 That's a great question.

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:07.500
 I like that one.

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:17.860
 The soul in the Aristotelian tradition is the form creator.

01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:31.140
 The soul is necessarily present as the ovum starts turning into an organism.

01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:39.180
 The Aristotelian concept is that the soul is there creating the process.

01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:44.500
 So do you kind of go along with that one, best you can tell?

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:47.140
 As far as I can tell.

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:48.140
 They talk about life.

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:50.380
 It's very interesting.

01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:57.020
 The sperm has life, and the ovum has life.

01:25:57.020 --> 01:26:02.420
 From a spiritual perspective, it never really started, it always was, kind of.

01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:03.420
 Yeah.

01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:06.420
 Kind of always was, right?

01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:17.220
 But the purpose is incomplete when you're only half of it, the sperm or the egg.

01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:27.700
 The completion concept is that the combination creates the individual.

01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:30.180
 Oh, the combination would...

01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:33.700
 Maybe there's something magical that happens then when they get together.

01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:34.700
 Yeah.

01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:35.700
 Yeah.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:45.980
 A couple more, then we'll let you go to work.

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:47.540
 Where is it here?

01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:48.540
 I lost the...

01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:49.540
 Oh, no, I didn't.

01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:50.540
 I got it.

01:26:50.540 --> 01:27:01.340
 I get so behind on these.

01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:07.940
 After my second COVID jab, wow, I developed insomnia, muscle spasms, inflammation.

01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:13.260
 The symptoms become even worse during stress and before my period.

01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:18.060
 Could this be an autoimmune condition connected with histamine or estrogen?

01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:23.220
 Any remedies that I could do to help me get through this?

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:24.220
 Wow.

01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:25.220
 Yeah.

01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:40.300
 The inflammatory processes are triggered purposely by the vaccine, and they overlap with the

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:46.700
 problem, whatever inflammatory problem you might have been having is going to get worse

01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:51.140
 when it's activated.

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:59.780
 The beneficial effects of aspirin and progesterone and vitamin D, all of the anti-inflammatory

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:05.100
 things are going to be more important following the vaccine.

01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:08.100
 So the aspirin really, you're such a...

01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:12.220
 You mentioned so often, Dr. Peat, on these shows over these years.

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:16.740
 So aspirin, is it more than a symptomatic thing like getting rid of a headache?

01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:17.740
 It is really anti-inflammatory?

01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:18.740
 Oh, yeah.

01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:35.380
 It gets right in at the basis of correcting probably 10 or 20 known mechanisms that are

01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:40.180
 interrupting stress-induced processes with inflammation.

01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:41.860
 Interesting.

01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:46.620
 And is there a downside of somebody wanting to take it every day?

01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:49.860
 I mean, is that okay?

01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:56.340
 Eventually it could cause a vitamin K deficiency.

01:28:56.340 --> 01:29:06.300
 So if you're going to be taking big doses for a long time, you should eat aged cheeses,

01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:13.100
 some liver, cooked kale and broccoli and so on.

01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:14.700
 Yeah, all the good stuff.

01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:21.980
 So when you say big doses, is big doses more than just two 300 milligram bears?

01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:25.460
 No, that's a good dose.

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.260
 That's a good dose?

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:28.260
 Yeah.

01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:34.660
 But for cancer and arthritis, people often take much bigger doses.

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:35.660
 Do they?

01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:36.660
 Yeah.

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:37.660
 Yeah.

01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:40.460
 I mean, can you just do, if people wanted to do it, just the old bear aspirin or does

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:43.460
 it have stuff in there you don't want?

01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.100
 Yeah.

01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:53.380
 You can get pure USP aspirin for 15 or 20 dollars a pound.

01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:54.380
 A pound?

01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:57.540
 In pure crystalline form.

01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:02.140
 And then you can figure out how many milligrams that is and just take it, huh?

01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:06.380
 Yeah, like an eighth of a teaspoon or so.

01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:12.900
 And then getting this, it helps the body, it could help the body if I understand you,

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:16.900
 what you're saying, Dr. Peat, could help the body to heal a lot of different things

01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:20.900
 if the inflammation goes down, right?

01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:23.100
 Yeah.

01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:31.100
 A lot of our excess inflammation comes from eating the polyunsaturated fats.

01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:36.980
 The old poofers.

01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:40.260
 One year ago, writes Martin, I developed Peyronie's disease.

01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:44.380
 Is there a way with diet or protocol to reduce it?

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:46.500
 Yeah, vitamin K.

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:47.500
 Vitamin K.

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:51.500
 Or vitamin E, I mean.

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.500
 Okay.

01:30:52.500 --> 01:31:03.860
 And anti-estrogens, progesterone and thyroid and vitamin A. But vitamin E in particular

01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:12.620
 helps the aspirin and progesterone to reduce the fiber formation.

01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:18.340
 Roger writes in, the other night, it was actually morning, about two or three o'clock, I had

01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:25.860
 the most incredible painful cramp in my left calf.

01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:31.300
 And it was terrible and it took a long time for it to go away and now two days later it

01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:32.740
 still hurts.

01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:38.060
 What could be the underlying cause, Dr. Peat, of why this happened and how I can prevent

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:39.060
 it again?

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:40.060
 It was very painful.

01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:41.060
 Wow.

01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:44.060
 What is that?

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:49.300
 A lot of things can start it.

01:31:49.300 --> 01:32:06.540
 The first aid is usually getting your sodium, magnesium, calcium, potassium in balance and

01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:16.860
 a spoonful of baking soda and about half a glass of water is a way to calm things by

01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:17.860
 a quick...

01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:22.580
 Oh, right there during the time, just boom.

01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:23.860
 Yeah.

01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:28.180
 And on the other thing, we got the sodium, potassium, calcium, that whole thing.

01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:29.940
 How do we get that in balance?

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:32.420
 How does that work?

01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:34.540
 Talk to us a little bit about that.

01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:44.540
 Eating too much meat, for example, with high phosphate content, that increases the parathyroid

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:56.980
 hormone and creates a loss of energy at all levels.

01:32:56.980 --> 01:33:06.180
 The parathyroid hormone blocks mitochondrial function and that lowers cell energy and cell

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:13.940
 energy is what keeps the internal electrolyte balance.

01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:16.740
 Does chicken have that high phosphorus as well as beef?

01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:17.740
 Oh, yeah.

01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:18.740
 Oh, it does?

01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:19.740
 Fish?

01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:20.740
 No?

01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:21.740
 Not fish?

01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:22.740
 Yep.

01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:23.740
 Fish too?

01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:30.500
 So just overall, too much protein, that could be a cause of that for this fellow?

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:31.500
 Yeah.

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:32.500
 Wow.

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:37.380
 Okay, finally, a little personal thing I just wanted to ask you about, but I think people

01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:39.020
 will find it interesting.

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:43.700
 I saw a graph the other day on the news, you know, how they're kind of really promoting

01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:47.860
 the idea of nuclear war, you know, Russia and all of that.

01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:53.980
 So they had this graph, this big graph, and it was all the 10 largest nuclear explosions

01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:58.460
 that we've had in our country, in the world, or I think in the world.

01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:10.140
 So I look on this graph and I see, whoa, in 1952, it says a 100 kiloton nuclear explosion

01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:14.580
 was on Johnston Island in 1952.

01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:20.220
 And it sparked my interest because, Dr. Peat, I was on Johnston Island 15 years later, for

01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:24.780
 a year and a half, on Armed Forces Radio in the South Pacific.

01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:32.020
 So how is it possible that I was on a place that a nuclear explosion 15 years ago, if

01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:37.420
 this nuclear radiation lasts for 100 years or whatever they say, and I've never had any

01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:39.500
 effects from it?

01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:56.260
 The worst effects are during the first year after the explosion, and the longer life isotopes

01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:59.860
 produce less harmful radiation.

01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:05.420
 So this whole idea that the Earth will be damaged for the 100 years or something, God

01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:10.580
 forbid that they ever did some nukes, it's not true.

01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:13.820
 Well, when you explode a lot of them...

01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:16.860
 I guess you can explode a lot of them, yeah.

01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:27.660
 Most of the radiation, long-lasting contamination from that explosion is elsewhere around the

01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:28.660
 Northern Hemisphere.

01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:30.300
 Oh, it's spread around.

01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:31.300
 Yeah.

01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:32.820
 It just didn't stay on the island.

01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:33.820
 Yeah.

01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:43.380
 And so if you just, no matter where you explode them, it's going to add to the long-lasting

01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:46.940
 background radiation.

01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:58.140
 And if you extrapolate to a thousand bombs going off in dirty situations...

01:35:58.140 --> 01:35:59.140
 I see.

01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:06.580
 ...stirring up lots of smoke and dust, that's where you're risking exterminating life.

01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:07.580
 I see.

01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:14.180
 So in the old, or in the proverbial conventional nuclear war when everybody's bombing everybody,

01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:17.180
 that could really be a problem.

01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:18.180
 Yeah.

01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:19.180
 Yeah.

01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:25.180
 Even insects would risk being extincted.

01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:26.180
 Yeah.

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:27.180
 Yeah.

01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:28.180
 Oh, very interesting.

01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:32.420
 Well, Dr. Ray Peat, it's always an honor to have you.

01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:34.660
 Thanks for coming on the show.

01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:38.580
 And your website is rayPeat.com, right?

01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:39.580
 RayPeat.com?

01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:40.580
 Mm-hmm.

01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:45.780
 RayPeat.com and Ray Peat's newsletter at gmail.com, rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:50.540
 You have about, what, four times a year now that you put that up.

01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:52.340
 People want to join up.

01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:53.900
 Okay, thanks.

01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:55.260
 You take care of yourself, sir.

01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:56.260
 Thank you for your time.

01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:57.260
 Appreciate it.

01:36:57.260 --> 01:36:58.260
 All right.

01:36:58.260 --> 01:36:59.260
 It's an honor.

01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:00.260
 A good guy, huh?

01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:01.260
 Yeah, it's a real deal.

01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:08.700
 I used to talk to somebody that actually kind of, sort of knows what they're talking about.

01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:17.060
 More than kind of, sort of.

01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:23.820
 So that's why I didn't get fried on Johnson Island 50 years ago, because it just...

01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:26.380
 Yeah, I saw that chart.

01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:27.380
 It was crazy.

01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:35.980
 In 1952, 100 kilothousand, I don't know what it was, big one, 15 years later, they say,

01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:38.380
 "Patrick, you want to go there and play records on Johnson?"

01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:39.380
 "Oh, sure.

01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:40.380
 I'll do that.

01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:41.380
 No problem."

01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:49.620
 But I, you know, I never felt anything out there.

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:56.700
 Somebody says, "Soul enters the fetus at the fourth or fifth month when quickening is felt.

01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:58.180
 That's the sign soul entering."

01:37:58.180 --> 01:37:59.180
 Yeah, maybe.

01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:05.660
 I don't know where you got that, but...

01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:06.660
 Could be.

01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:13.140
 A lot of viewpoints on this.

01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:20.580
 I think soul goes back and forth as well.

01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:32.060
 Yeah, you know, the whole abortion thing is such a personal and unique and, you know,

01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:34.620
 it's just above my pay grade to get involved in that at all.

01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:40.580
 You know, people need to do what they're going to do, and between you and God and the soul

01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:45.340
 that's around and work that one out yourself.

01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:47.340
 I don't have a dog in that fight.

01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:52.900
 You know what I mean?

01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:56.020
 No, no.

01:38:56.020 --> 01:39:01.420
 I know a wild old gypsy guy years ago, and he could see auras.

01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:03.740
 He really could see them.

01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:13.500
 And he told me that he would work with some pregnant people, and he could see the little

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:19.660
 aura of the soul sometimes and other times not.

01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:27.020
 And his conjecture was that soul is always going back and forth into the other realities,

01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:28.420
 just like we do today.

01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:39.580
 And when we go to sleep, when our body goes to sleep, we leave the body and we dream.

01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:40.580
 That's what's going on, folks.

01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:51.860
 It's not the mind spitting out Jungian, Freudian.

01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:59.420
 These are real experiences in the other realities, and we call them dreams.

01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:03.340
 And it's no different than this dream here, is it?

01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:04.340
 Same thing.

01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:10.140
 This is a dream, that's a dream, it's all a dream.

01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:15.340
 So it's a good thing to learn how to remember your dreams, because you're going to learn

01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:16.340
 a lot.

01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:19.260
 All right, kids, I will see you tomorrow.

01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:21.220
 Adam Bergstrom is going to be here.

01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:27.460
 Adam told us that the California New Salini people told him that they were going to turn

01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:30.420
 off his electricity Wednesday when he was scheduled to be on the show.

01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:36.740
 So I said, "Okay, you just come on the show now, Tuesday.

01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:39.900
 There's always a way."

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:46.260
 Quick reminder, we have a 20% discount on elk velvet that I'm going to be ordering

01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:49.540
 right now while the sale is on.

01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:53.420
 It's called Strong20, it's a promo code with Sir Thrival.

01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:57.900
 Elk velvet, wonderful source of collagen, all kinds of growth factors.

01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:00.100
 It keeps you young and snappy for a long time.

01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:01.100
 Help.

01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:02.100
 Hell helps.

01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:04.540
 So I love you.

01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:05.940
 Thank you for your support.

01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:07.340
 You're doing great.

01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:11.380
 No matter what anybody says, don't listen to anybody if they tell you you're not doing

01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:21.420
 great because you are, because only silly humans judge you and me, not God.

01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.420
 So I love you.

01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:23.420
 Thank you.

01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:24.420
 May the blessings be.

01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:27.260
 See you tomorrow.

01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:32.780
