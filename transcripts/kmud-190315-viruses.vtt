WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640
 Once again, it's the third Friday of the month, 7 o'clock to 8 o'clock p.m. Eastern Pacific Time.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.320
 From 7.30 until 8 o'clock this evening, we have a live call-in with people.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.160
 Welcome to call-in with questions related to the topic of the show and/or some unrelated questions.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:34.160
 We get all sorts from time to time. So once again, very pleased to join you here live from the Kmart Studios in Garboville.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:44.160
 It's March, it's gone the equinox now and the clocks have sprung forward and we're definitely getting some sunny warm heralds of the coming spring.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.160
 That we're in now I guess, but the coming early summer.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.160
 So once again, I'm very pleased to introduce Dr. Raymond Peat onto the live show.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:03.360
 And like I said, from 7.30 until 8 p.m., we're inviting callers to ask questions related to this month's topic,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:11.360
 which is the antiviral activity of medicinal plants and their constituents and how Dr. Peat interprets the antiviral activity,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.160
 because it's not always a straightforward antiviral activity, but rather a host response.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:26.160
 That's often the remedy or the provoking factor which stimulates the immune system into defense.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:38.160
 So the number if you live in the area or even outside the area or from Iceland or Australia or wherever you call in from, number 707-923-3911.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.160
 And from 7.30 until 8 p.m., we'll be taking calls.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
 So once again, Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:54.160
 As always, I'd like to start the show off by asking you to introduce yourself, give a rundown of your professional and academic background,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:02.160
 so people can understand where you're coming from and later on I'll give people more information on how to find your website and your articles.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:16.160
 After undergraduate study in humanities and a master's degree, also in generally humanities, a thesis on William Blake,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:26.160
 I later, about 10 years later, went to graduate school in biology, interested in brain physiology,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:44.160
 but ended up working on reproductive physiology because the brain biology people seemed too indoctrinated with membrane theory and other stylish things at the time.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:56.160
 So I worked on reproductive physiology and that got me interested in how the hormones affect consciousness among other things,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:08.160
 and how nutrition and hormones interact with other environmental factors to affect our immunity and development consciousness and so on.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:19.160
 Okay. Well, I think to open up this month's topic, I know some of the subject matter we may have touched on in the past,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:31.160
 I know certainly some compounds will come up repeatedly in terms of their anti-inflammatory and stress reducing potential,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.160
 as well as antioxidant potential and a number of other things that work together for the good of the host.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:48.160
 We've been intimately associated with viruses ever since we walked the face of the earth,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:04:00.160
 and then I've heard various stories of viral DNA being part of our DNA, I think up to 8%.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.160
 Was that, am I right in thinking 8% is kind of often quoted proportion?

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.160
 Retroviral DNA seems to be around that.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:26.160
 Okay. Alright. So firstly, given how you understand viruses and any potential benefit that they may confer,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:35.160
 although most people consider viral illness not at all beneficial but a detriment to their health and to the health of others,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:46.160
 obviously the World Health Organization has been campaigning a long time for things from polio eradication to the Ebola outbreaks that have been grabbing the mainstream news,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:55.160
 but how are we to interpret the viral inclusion in our DNA and our evolution with them if we're to understand their role

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.160
 and our approach to dealing with the damaging effects of coexisting with viruses,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
 especially where they cause high mortality and morbidity?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:15.160
 While bacteria have their own independent existence, they can generally live without us.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.160
 Viruses depend on a higher organism to exist.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:28.160
 When I was in graduate school, I asked a few people what they thought the origin of viruses was,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:35.160
 and no one wanted to suggest anything at all.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:44.160
 The nature of the immune system at that time, 1970,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:56.160
 people were still very puzzled about how we could have such an immense potential immunity to every sort of conceivable antigen.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:08.160
 At that time, they were still thinking in terms of being born, being created with every antibody, every gene specifying an antibody,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:23.160
 and someone worked out the numbers and saw that it would take something the size of a tennis ball for a nucleus of every cell if it was to contain genes for every antibody that we produce.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:34.160
 So people had to start thinking about innovation, the inventive process happening for the immune system,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:54.160
 and the origin of viruses seemed to be related to that process of cell invention, innovation, and interaction.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:07.160
 People have said that viral diseases became a human problem at the same time that we shifted to an agricultural economy,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.160
 suggesting that diet could be part of it.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:28.160
 Historically, wars, famines, and deforestation, all sorts of natural disasters have led to epidemics.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:38.160
 One theory is that stress causes mutations in the virus, causing a benign virus to mutate and become dangerous.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:50.160
 But whatever the mechanism is, it's known that viruses appear and circulate during social stresses.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:08:04.160
 When you look at an individual under stress, each type of tissue or organ sends out messages when it's under stress.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:17.160
 These little microvesicles, microsomes, various names for them, are emitted as a very fine, sub-microscopic particle

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:26.160
 which contains nucleic acids, RNA, DNA, proteins, hormones, a great variety of substances,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:40.160
 that travel to other cells in the body and can be assimilated, transmitting differentiated nucleic acid patterns

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:47.160
 to other cells that are under stress, helping them adapt.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.160
 When the individual is under stress, this is natural.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.160
 Everyone does this constantly.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.160
 The sicker you are, the more of these microvesicles you have circulating around.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:08.160
 That seems to be why old serum transmits aging.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:17.160
 Young serum transfusions communicate a youthful physiology.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:28.160
 So part of the stress of aging is that we're sending more and more of these distress messages around.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:41.160
 Since viruses never could develop on their own, it's probable that they're an emission from a stressed population,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:48.160
 escaping from this therapeutic, corrective, adaptive process that happens always,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.160
 constantly within our body as part of our normal development.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
 Some of that escapes.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:01.160
 Getting into an organism which is in a different state of stress,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:12.160
 can become a virus or a microvesicle that the recipient organism hasn't learned how to deal with.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:19.160
 Interesting. I want to go back to something you touched on that triggered a memory in me about an article that I read

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:26.160
 about the epidemiology of viruses as best we know it or we can understand it now.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:33.160
 They wanted to link the fact that viral diseases became a lot more prevalent during organization

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.160
 when people and communities started living in it.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160
 You mentioned the word agrarian.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.160
 When they started getting together and growing crops in one location rather than being nomadic

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:50.160
 and population started to increase locally in a concentration that up until that point

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.160
 never really allowed viruses an effective means of spread.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.160
 But once we started becoming community oriented and living in towns and bigger towns and cities, etc.,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.160
 it made it very easy for viruses to spread from one person to another.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.160
 It was the grains that made that kind of civilization easy to develop.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
 And the grains are bad for you, right?

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
 Yeah. Two things in particular.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:27.160
 They're very high in phosphate and low in calcium.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:34.160
 That in itself I think is enough to damage your immunity.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:41.160
 So you think it's just that practice of growing wheat in large quantities to feed the masses

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:49.160
 affected the nutritional status of the people enough to allow something like that negative effect

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:56.160
 of decreasing calcium and increasing phosphate to actually become an issue or develop into a problem

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:03.160
 that would be affecting a person's health and/or allow the host to become susceptible.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:09.160
 And a high iron content in the diet is another thing that damages immunity

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:18.160
 because most microorganisms depend on iron as one of their hosts.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:26.160
 You've always mentioned iron as being a very damaging element in terms of its ability to oxidize things

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:32.160
 and rapidly cause that kind of damage and that high iron is always associated with disease.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:42.160
 Yeah. And that has been one of my interests in looking at the role of milk in public health

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.160
 because it's very low in iron.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.160
 Right. High calcium.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:52.160
 Yeah. And babies are immune to many diseases such as malaria and viral diseases

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
 while they're being breastfed.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:00.160
 And so they're getting a high calcium intake and a low iron intake.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:08.160
 So I don't mean to throw it out there to question you per se, but that's a fact, is it?

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.160
 That babies that are being breastfed have a statistically lower proportion of disease

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.160
 than children that have been weaned and are excited to eat food and...

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:28.160
 Yeah. Some of these like respiratory infections are said to be only about 20% as frequent as breastfed babies.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:35.160
 And malaria and such in the zones where it's endemic,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:42.160
 babies don't get it until right after they stop being breastfed for years older.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
 Okay. Let's hold it there for a second.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:50.160
 You're listening to iOscuro, the doctor on KMUD, Garboville 91.1 FM.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.160
 From 7.30 to 8 o'clock, we'll be taking callers.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.160
 You can call in the number here, 707-923-3911.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:06.160
 I just wanted to make a mention as well during this show, as well as you probably have heard prior in this week

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.160
 and will be hearing over the weekend and through next week, that it's KMUD's pledge drive.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:18.160
 And right now, we're at 34,170 out of a hoped for 70,000.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:30.160
 So we are essentially, virtually halfway between 70,000 in raising the funds necessary to keep this show and all the others on the air.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:38.160
 I just want to remind people time and time again that we have a free speech radio station here in this part of Humboldt County in Northern California.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:46.160
 And there are not that many freely independent radio stations broadcasting pretty much what's local

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:53.160
 and pretty much what is the current pulse of things, whether it's politically or economically, etc.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:58.160
 So it's a very valuable resource and I know this show wouldn't exist without KMUD.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:05.160
 So I'm very grateful for KMUD to allow this and all the other programs to exist in its free speech in its purest form.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:15.160
 So I really appreciate people calling in and pledging whatever amount they can afford for a yearly membership or lifetime membership, if you can afford that.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.160
 But anyway, please donate because it's what keeps the show going.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:33.160
 So Dr. Peat, to carry on the kind of discourse here about your understanding, your reasoning behind disease born of a virus

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:42.160
 and your understanding of our ability to interact or live in the presence of a virus and/or some viruses,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:49.160
 the first is that it's not in the interest of the virus to kill the host because they can only replicate inside a living organism.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:16:00.160
 And you've mentioned in the past that viruses or in fact the genetic information they contain is passed down from generation to generation through

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:07.160
 and it can be passed down through the DNA and that actually is a kind of messenger system in some way.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:13.160
 But can you explain that in terms of how that could possibly benefit the organism?

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:20.160
 Because I know I want to talk a little bit about viral disease and I would imagine anybody with cold sores or you know,

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.160
 they contract measles or they've got warts would ever imagine that this could be a beneficial thing.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:35.160
 But in terms of what viruses do and their information that they carry and how they plug this into our DNA to affect a change,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:42.160
 given that we've coexisted with viruses ever since we were walking the face of the earth,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:50.160
 how do you see viruses in the scheme of things, you know, when they're not actually just straight out killing people with Ebola or you know,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:58.160
 other deadly viral diseases, how do you imagine that they've existed for so long and how they could be beneficial?

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:11.160
 In the big historical epidemics, there have always been some people who never caught the disease, were simply naturally immune.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:22.160
 I think that's the way everyone is when they aren't subjugated and fed a grain diet.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:40.160
 I think the social invention of disease, especially viral disease, is a definite historical thing that you can see the cellular meaning in a very direct way.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:56.160
 There hasn't been much written about the concept of reductive stress, but it simply means that when your cells are being burdened or overstimulated,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:11.160
 more than their oxidative metabolism can deal with, they lose their oxidative, pro-oxidative balance and go into the reductive stress.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:25.160
 That's where iron, for example, becomes toxic because iron that is harmlessly stored in the oxidizing cell suddenly becomes a source of free radical destruction

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:31.160
 when the cell goes over into the overstimulated reductive state.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:41.160
 I think that's the central fact of the failure of the immune system.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:49.160
 It's something interfering with the oxidative, pro-oxidative balance of the nervous system.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:59.160
 Calcium deficiency or phosphate excess is another thing that contributes to that reductive stress.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:05.160
 The parathyroid hormone shifts the cells in that direction.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:14.160
 When you're eating too much grain phosphate, you increase your parathyroid hormone.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:24.160
 That shifts your balance over in the direction of too much reduction, activating cellular weakness and oxidative destruction.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:37.160
 You have mentioned fairly regularly about cell stability and how the cell's inherent stability is essential in terms of maintaining good health

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:44.160
 and that it's the reductive processes that damage cellular integrity and stability

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:54.160
 and that these things energetically lead to a weakness with results of the cells inability to maintain order, if you like.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:01.160
 Because everything in this universe is about energy and order and entropy is the kind of opposite end of that.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:06.160
 It's the disease, decay, chaos, state of breakdown.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:19.160
 Whereas in a perfect body, everything that we have is really been given to produce order and replication and cell turnover and managing cells

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.160
 and everything that we hear about disease, death and cancer, etc., especially cancer,

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:29.160
 is a disorganized inability to stabilize the cell and things are out of control.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:41.160
 So from an energetic point of view, your mind sets upon that type of energetic basis for good health

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:47.160
 and it looks at viruses in exactly the same kind of light, perhaps, as many other things.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:21:01.160
 For the cell energy system, cancer and bacterial and viral infections and various types of inflammation are all the same process.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:08.160
 It shifts from the production of carbon dioxide, which is an anti-entropic factor.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:20.160
 The carbon dioxide spontaneously binds to all of the amino groups in proteins and shifts the acidic balance

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:31.160
 and so the mineral retaining balance of the cell, stabilizing it in the potassium retaining calcium and sodium,

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:38.160
 resisting condition of the cell, the stable confirmation of the cell proteins.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:45.160
 And when something interferes with your ability to produce that stabilizing carbon dioxide,

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:51.160
 instead we produce lactic acid, which adds exactly the opposite.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:22:02.160
 It shifts us over into the unstable state, increased pH, ionization that attracts calcium and sodium

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.160
 and can't take up enough magnesium and potassium.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.160
 Okay, good.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:15.160
 You're listening to Ask Herb, Dr. K. Medeagal with 91.1 FM from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.160
 Callers are invited to call in questions they'd like to post to Dr. Peat.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:25.160
 Either about this month's subject of antivirals and viruses, their existence, etc. etc.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.160
 Or unrelated subjects.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:33.160
 The number here is the number 707-923-3911.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.160
 Okay, so getting on to...

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:43.160
 Obviously we need, I say obviously, but I think it's in most human interest not to be diseased,

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:48.160
 especially in the light of this month's subject of viruses.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:54.160
 It's definitely beneficial not to get smallpox or not to get Ebola or etc. etc.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.160
 It's not a beneficial state to be diseased like that.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:06.160
 And so that begs the question, apart from smallpox, which apparently is the only known successful eradication,

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:11.160
 even though they have stocks of it in Russia, and I think America has stocks of smallpox,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.160
 they've almost got them to destroy those stocks.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:21.160
 But anyway, I think it's the only eradication program that has been "successful".

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:27.160
 In terms of actually dealing with viruses, how...

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:33.160
 And I guess I want to bring up another point about technology that in the last four or five years

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:39.160
 has made some pretty big leaps, maybe perhaps with not enough oversight,

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:46.160
 because I know the creation of human embryos that can resist HIV is a fairly controversial subject in China,

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:52.160
 where they disclosed, or at least people found out, they've been using CRISPR technology to edit genes,

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:59.160
 and that these gene sequences never before so easily tampered with, clipped etc. etc.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:05.160
 and reinserted back into the embryo to do what they wanted, has become available now.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.160
 I know that you've said that they just haven't had enough time to refine this,

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.160
 and what they're doing at this point in time is actually probably going to be a Pandora's box,

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.160
 but what do you think about the whole process?

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.160
 As I know you're not mechanistic, so that's why I'm asking you,

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:28.160
 but in terms of editing genes and inserting or reinserting or, you know, editing,

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:34.160
 how do you look at this technology in terms of, do you think it's going to become helpful,

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.160
 or do you think it's still going to be plagued by the same takeover?

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:49.160
 I think it's exactly the same ideology that was imposed early in the 20th century as Neo-Darwinism,

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:59.160
 and it basically removed some of Darwin's most important ideas and called it Neo-Darwinism,

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:06.160
 but Darwin wouldn't have subscribed to Neo-Darwinism.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:17.160
 It's a purely mechanical theory of existence in which random variations in the genetic material

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:22.160
 is the essential idea. It's randomness from the bottom up.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:33.160
 Random changes lead to eventually, by weeding out ones that don't work,

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:38.160
 supposedly the random changes led to something that worked,

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:46.160
 and then those by random diffusion within a cell do various things.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:51.160
 Everything is explained in terms of random changes.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:26:03.160
 Ever since Lamarck and Darwin, the practical people working with organisms have known that that doesn't work.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:12.160
 It's only the academic ideologues who have pushed that abstract view of genetics.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:19.160
 James A. Shapiro has worked as a bacterial geneticist.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:27.160
 He has written books describing bacteria as perfect genetic engineers.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:34.160
 They're perfectly designing and engineering their genetic systems,

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:47.160
 but his view of all organisms or of nature is that life is cognitive all the way down, top to bottom.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:55.160
 Instead of randomness, it's cognition. Cognition on the cellular level, brain level, and so on.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:06.160
 Okay, so what about bacteriophages now as a kind of elusive point here to manipulate viruses?

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.160
 What was the word? Bacterial what?

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.160
 Bacteriophage. Oh, oh.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.160
 The phage technology.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:19.160
 Yeah, that for the intestine or wounds that are infected with bacteria.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:26.160
 Eastern Europe and Asia have, over the last 70 or 80 years,

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:38.160
 have developed a great collection of these viruses that specialize in destroying living on bacteria.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:50.160
 They're harmless to people, but they will eliminate bacteria that have got out of control in our intestines or in infected wounds.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.160
 Okay, cool.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:56.160
 Okay, so I've got some specific questions about some specific viruses.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:02.160
 I know that you've always got an alternative approach to treating conditions.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:09.160
 But some of these conditions obviously I've asked you about in the past here with people directly even.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.160
 And I've seen myself, you know, the outcome of this.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:29.160
 I wanted to, I guess, first start with something that is, I think they call it 30 or 35 percent of the population have either come into contact with it or are currently suffering with it.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.160
 This is human papillomavirus, both in males and females.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:51.160
 And in males, the genital warts, and in females, the dysplasia that can be seen by gynecologists, etc., on females, that can eventually lead to cervical cancer.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:59.160
 And certainly seems to be a pretty alarming state where there's so many of the population are actually suffering.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:13.160
 And I know whilst things like genital warts seem to be "self-limiting" in terms of it not just progressing from bad to worse, but they eventually clear up.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.160
 And potentially you don't see any further complications of it.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:23.160
 There is and has been associated with them things like penile cancer.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:45.160
 And so that this is one example of a virus here that's directly interfering with a host's DNA and energy and flow of electrons in the correct ways to bring about this cellular degradation to a point where the body's lost control of the organization there within the organism.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:51.160
 And so either cancers are rising as a result of this.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:30:01.160
 And this is what they call the oncogenic, the oncogene or the oncogenic effect where this virus is actually being shown to cause a future cancer.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:11.160
 What do you think about both of those things, human papilloma and genital warts and the kind of things they engender?

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:26.160
 The cervical dysplasia that is one of its effects can, if it persists, can become carcinoma in situ or cervical cancer and so on.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:50.160
 But all of the women that I've known who had cervical dysplasia or carcinoma in situ of the cervix cleared it up in just a few weeks by improving their diet and applying vitamin A, vitamin E, progesterone, taking supplements of folic acid and thyroid.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:31:10.160
 Can I just hold you there? I know I personally have worked with this and helped just advising other people, you know, just being there in terms of the source of information for exactly what you just mentioned is a vitamin A, you said, and progesterone.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:18.160
 And I know this would be something that would be best used topically in terms of a pessary kind of treatment, right?

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:28.160
 How do you see that or those substances, and I guess we call it for the sake of the topic of this month, antiviral.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:39.160
 How would you see that antiviral activity affecting the change in a tissue that after X amount of time comes back as being healthy tissue again and not dysplastic?

00:31:39.160 --> 00:32:01.160
 The irritation, among other things, any irritation increases the reductive balance of the cell and activation of estrogen production and estrogen tends to lock it into that reductive and dysplastic condition.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:18.160
 And these various things in different ways, vitamin A opposes the structural changes on epithelial cells as an anti-estrogen differentiating effect.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:38.160
 Progesterone knocks out the estrogen and its product. All of the metabolic changes shift the cell away from estrogen and inflammation towards the oxidative energy producing condition.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:59.160
 The mainstream medicine would hold the view that colposcopy, which is a term they've given to this procedure where they take basically a cone, they bore a cone of tissue out of the cervix in the area where they identify this dysplasia, this disorganized cell.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:28.160
 And that goes against all the tenets of anything that you've ever held true that cancers, you just don't start cutting into tissue around a cancer because not just from a potential of not getting it all but having any kind of spread but because the alarm signal that has been well documented or the bystander effect when cells are alarmed and in trouble as would happen during something like an excision.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:35.160
 That's a very trigger for something to become in a state of alarm.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:48.160
 If you're extremely healthy, you can heal, you can stand to have a bit of tissue cut away and heal it up with a healthy almost not visible scar.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:34:04.160
 But to the extent that you're not fully in the oxidative condition, any wound is going to leave its trace as a more or less defective healed area.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:19.160
 A bad scar tissue has lower oxygen tension, puts the cells under stress, tends to attract repair cells but to damage the repair cells because the tissue is defective.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:23.160
 So it becomes a center for cancer regrowth.

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:35.160
 Any destruction of the tissue if you're not fully healthy which you wouldn't be if you were having the cancer in the first place.

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:44.160
 But if you can recover your good oxidative health, then you can probably stand having a bit of tissue cut out.

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:52.160
 Okay, I just want to remind people, ask your Arab doctor, KMEDGarboville91.1FM from now until 8 o'clock.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:35:02.160
 The number to call is 707-923-3911 and we do have our first caller on air waiting and caller, you're on the air.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.160
 Where are you from and what's your question?

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.160
 Hi, I'm from Arizona.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.160
 Thanks for the show, Andrew and Dr. Peat.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:15.160
 Dr. Peat, your article on immunodeficiency mentions the autoantibodies several times.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:27.160
 Glutamate is an excitatory amino acid and glutamate decarboxylates the enzyme that turns glutamate into GABA which is associated with relaxation somehow.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:37.160
 My question is about how some people have autoantibodies to this enzyme and these are associated with type 1 diabetes and stiff man syndrome.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:49.160
 I was wondering if you had any comments on the system and how does gamma hydroxybutyrate and/or passion fruit juice influence the autoantibodies in GABA?

00:35:49.160 --> 00:36:05.160
 I think the energy system should be able to use the antibodies to clean out the defective enzymes and not continue to be produced.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:17.160
 I think supporting the GABA system with magnesium, glucose, carbon dioxide, anti-inflammatory things,

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:36.160
 the pro-GABA steroids derived from progesterone in particular, and the anti-immune steroid DHEA which helps to redirect the antibody production.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:47.160
 Estrogen tends to make us overproduce antibodies but not be able to guide the correction process.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:57.160
 So things that shift the whole physiology towards oxidation and the relaxed, highly energized state of the cell.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:03.160
 I think that's the route out of all of those autoimmune diseases.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:11.160
 Do you have any comments on people who have adverse childhood experiences and physical injuries?

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:19.160
 I had a head injury 20 years ago.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:39.160
 Those same things, the things that increase stability and energy production and carbon dioxide production, all of those are constantly causing cells to be born and differentiate in the right direction.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:49.160
 Last question, is there any use for GABA supplementation?

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:54.160
 Normally it doesn't get into the brain because of the so-called blood-brain barrier,

00:37:54.160 --> 00:38:02.160
 but when the brain is very injured it is taken up because basically the brain needs it.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:15.160
 But ordinarily I think it's enough just to eat a pro-oxidative diet, avoid the excess of phosphate, lactic acid, iron and so on.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.160
 Okay, well thank you and have a good day.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.160
 Thank you for your call. I think we have one or two other callers waiting here.

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:26.160
 So let's go to our next caller. Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.160
 I'm from New York and I... Hello?

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:35.160
 Yeah, hi. I got some kind of feedback. I'm not sure if the engineer can do anything or if it's anything of your end.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.160
 No, it has nothing to do with me, but I have two questions.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:44.160
 Dr. Peat, we've spoken before. First question relates to dry CO2.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:49.160
 The notion of doing that in a bath or doing it in a big bag may not be ideal.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.160
 So one other approach and one I've tried, just want to get your feedback on it,

00:38:53.160 --> 00:39:04.160
 is to get four different bags, put them like around your both legs up to the knee, on both arms sort of beyond the elbow,

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.160
 and you know, fill them up with the CO2.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:12.160
 And actually you could do it with a shower cap too on your head without, you know, impairing your breathing.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:20.160
 And if you go to sleep at night, I found that like four or five hours later I'll wake up and I'm over 50,

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.160
 so you know, the hormones are moving in the wrong direction.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:34.160
 I'll find that there's a lot of moisture, I mean literally in some cases a lot of wetness in those bags after four hours.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.160
 If you do it for like an hour, you don't get anywhere near that amount.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.160
 It can wake you up. So I'm just wondering, is that a good approach?

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.160
 What is going on there and does that make you dehydrated?

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.160
 Should you be drinking water? Because clearly you're getting rid of bad water and retaining good water.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:57.160
 But I just wanted to get a little more of a physiological explanation of what's going on and how it's good and how long it lasts.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:07.160
 The mechanism is that the carbon dioxide relaxes your skin blood vessels so your skin gets pink and warm.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:22.160
 And then the plastic bag prevents the water from leaving. So it's just natural sweat vaporization.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:27.160
 It's an inconvenience, but it doesn't hurt anything.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:35.160
 But is it a good thing? In other words, is it literally removing bad, you know, poorly structured water from the cell?

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:49.160
 Well, people who have had terrible edema, keeping their legs or lower body in a bag, very, very efficiently get rid of the edema.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:58.160
 So much of the water is going to leave through your kidneys and your lungs being breathed out.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.160
 But also some of it is leaving through your warm skin.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:08.160
 So do you think that's a good thing to do in place of the other? I mean, have you heard of that?

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.160
 Or what are the downsides of what I just described?

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:16.160
 No problem, except you might get mold.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.160
 Might get what?

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:26.160
 Skin fungus. If you stay too humid too long, it might favor the growth of microorganisms on your skin.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:32.160
 In a matter of hours? I would think days, yes, but in a matter of like two hours versus an hour?

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:46.160
 It probably isn't a problem, but like just wearing sweaty shoes for several hours can favor overgrowth of fungus.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:54.160
 Okay, second question relates to thyroid. You discussed the adrenal gland and how it can rejuvenate itself and other glands.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:02.160
 And so it seems to me that the adrenal gland provides a multitude of different hormones in production,

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:09.160
 whereas the thyroid only produces, you know, I guess T1 through T4, if I'm not mistaken, maybe a few others,

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.160
 but nowhere near the breadth of the adrenal gland.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:19.160
 And so I'm wondering if the adrenal gland does all the things that it does and it's able to regenerate itself,

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.160
 why wouldn't the same thing apply to the thyroid gland?

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:28.160
 In other words, it seems that in the past, perhaps it can be useful for older people,

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:34.160
 even if they haven't had deficient thyroids, to continue to take thyroid medicine forever.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:40.160
 And I guess I'm thinking, why is that? Because you certainly wouldn't apply that to adrenal glands.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:45.160
 Is it possible for the thyroid to rejuvenate itself and actually function normally,

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:51.160
 such that you could literally not have to take any thyroid medicine after some period of time,

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:56.160
 or you could take two or three other items that ultimately would provide an adequate proxy?

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:04.160
 The reason people benefit from taking a thyroid supplement isn't that their gland is weak.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:10.160
 It's that their whole body is working to interfere with the function.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:20.160
 There can be enough thyroxine circulating in the body of a hypothyroid person for a dozen people,

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:31.160
 but if your body is not activating it properly, not able to mobilize the mitochondrial respiration,

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.160
 then that thyroxine is counterproductive.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:43.160
 In some cases, it interferes with the formation and effect of T3.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:47.160
 If someone wasn't happy taking that for a long period of time,

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:52.160
 they had inadequately or maybe just a minor suboptimal functioning thyroid,

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:59.160
 are there two or three things that you would say that are really important

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:04.160
 if you're not going to take thyroid medicine to proxy for that?

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:11.160
 When you have eliminated most of the polyunsaturated fats in your tissues,

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:16.160
 then your tissues are extremely sensitive to thyroid hormone,

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:23.160
 and so your gland doesn't have to work very hard to keep you in a high metabolic condition.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.160
 That's the number one thing.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:30.160
 What you're saying is the thyroid will regenerate itself the same way an adrenal gland will,

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.160
 the same way any gland will, but that's actually not the point.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:39.160
 The point is the body and your consumption of PUFA, the transport, the absorption, the cell, etc.,

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:47.160
 it's the entire train ride to the cell that ultimately gets interfered with, not the gland production.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.160
 Is that what you're saying?

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:57.160
 Yes, and by the time a person is 45, the body is really soaked in polyunsaturated fats.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:07.160
 They talk about the N-3 fatty acids as being predominant in the brain,

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:10.160
 but that's only an old brain.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:18.160
 A healthy, young, 5-year-old brain is highly saturated in comparison to a middle-aged brain.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.160
 It's funny you mentioned just another point on the omega-3s,

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:26.160
 because Mary Enag wrote an article, and I can't remember whether you support her review or not,

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:33.160
 but she actually said that the problem is you need some, and you need them to be in equal proportion,

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:40.160
 one-to-one ratio between 3s and 6s, but she doesn't say that you don't need them.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:46.160
 It just seems to be, even from people that are alternative medicine people who are relatively credible

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:52.160
 and have no vested interest to deceive anybody,

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:58.160
 it seems there are a lot of sources that seem to believe that there's some benefit.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:05.160
 So I don't know whether the goal is to get to zero, because you've also mentioned that the ratio of saturated

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:14.160
 to unsaturated may actually be more important than whether or not you accumulate PUFA.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:19.160
 So I'm just trying to get a little bit of perspective on that, because context, I guess, is everything, right?

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:28.160
 Yes. If you look at a newborn brain, people are now saying that all newborns are deficient in PUFA,

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:37.160
 but when you look at the brain function, the reason little kids can learn so spectacularly quickly

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:42.160
 is that their brains aren't overloaded with PUFA.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:47.160
 The metabolic rate is extremely high in the absence of PUFA.

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:57.160
 That's one of the things that Burr, in 1932 or '33, discovered was his animals that were made deficient

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:04.160
 in the so-called essential fatty acids, he put them under a bell jar and found that they were consuming oxygen

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:09.160
 almost twice as fast as the normal rats.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:17.160
 So we have a terrifically high metabolic rate when we're two or three or four years old,

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:22.160
 and it's gradually suppressed as we accumulate fish oil and vegetable oil.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.160
 Thank you for that, Cora. I appreciate your call.

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.160
 We've got a caller waiting, so let's move on to the next caller.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.160
 Thank you.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.160
 You're welcome.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.160
 Cora, where are you from and what's your question?

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:36.160
 Hi, I'm calling from New York, and thank you for this great show.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.160
 Another New Yorker.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:47.160
 I had a question sort of similar to the previous caller about fully hydrogenated oils.

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:56.160
 I think, Dr. Peat, I think you've recommended fully hydrogenated oils to improve metabolic rate.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:04.160
 My question is, do you think that the catalyst that they use to hydrogenate the oils

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:12.160
 and the little maybe the particles that flake off of the screen that they use for hydrogenating them,

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:17.160
 do you think that's a serious problem?

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:29.160
 It's definitely worrisome, and I think we should look for a much better way to get saturated fats.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:37.160
 But the experiments like the Russians who used fully hydrogenated peanut oil

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:46.160
 and found that old mitochondria were restored to the youthful functions just with that highly saturated peanut oil,

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:59.160
 the results are so good that despite the possible danger of traces of the catalyst.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.160
 Okay.

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.160
 All right, thank you.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:10.160
 Do you think that the more saturated the fat is, maybe the more antiviral and antibacterial it could be?

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.160
 Because I know that coconut oil is, but --

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:19.160
 Yeah, I think it is the saturated fatty acids that are most antibacterial

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:24.160
 and probably help with the viral resistance.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.160
 Okay, well, thank you very much.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.160
 I appreciate it.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.160
 Thank you.

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.160
 Thank you for your call.

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:33.160
 Okay, in case there's anybody else out there wanting to get a question in before 8 o'clock,

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:38.160
 the number here is 707-923-3911.

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:42.160
 This is Ask Your Ab Doctor, KMED Galvapour 91.1 FM.

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:46.160
 And I just want to mention again that we are running our pledge drive here, folks.

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:51.160
 So for all of those people that are listening, whether they've called in or not,

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:56.160
 we'd really appreciate your financial support, however much you'd like to give.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:03.160
 And if you just call the same number, the 707-923-3911 number would work

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.160
 to get your pledge to the people waiting to receive them.

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:12.160
 And we do appreciate your support is what keeps the radio station alive.

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:16.160
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, a couple of interesting calls there.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:20.160
 I wanted to carry on the topic here with antivirals,

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:25.160
 looking at some specific components in plants,

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:32.160
 and namely some medicinal plants that have been pulled out and have been used as trials.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:39.160
 I know trials, but for trials' sake, are sometimes a little bit poorly designed

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:44.160
 or sometimes the results are skewed unfairly in one or the other direction.

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:50.160
 But obviously things like the flavonoids, and I want to mention my other question

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:56.160
 that I have for you if we get time for it, naringin and naringenin.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:01.160
 But let's start with the flavonoids as a chemical group,

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.160
 especially from green tea.

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.160
 Now we've all heard about the benefits of green tea,

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:10.160
 not just from the Chinese, but from many other people around the world

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:16.160
 who seem to believe and some research is showing that there's some definite

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:20.160
 clinical benefit from consuming green tea daily.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:25.160
 As I'm sure you will say that coffee's consumption is also very useful.

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:31.160
 But the antioxidants, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate,

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:36.160
 they're said to be reducing glutamate excitotoxicity.

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:43.160
 Now you've always talked about excitotoxicity in general as being a very negative energy reducing

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.160
 kind of state, a wasteful state of the cell.

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.160
 Yeah, it puts you in the reductive stress condition.

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:56.160
 So if both of these flavonoid compounds then reduce this excitotoxicity,

00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:00.160
 then that's got to be a good thing in terms of stabilizing things

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:04.160
 and calming the cell down and reducing inflammation, right?

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:12.160
 Yeah, although they're called antioxidants, like vitamin C is called an antioxidant,

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:17.160
 but when it's in the cell, when those flavonoids are in the cell,

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.160
 they function as pro-oxidants.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:24.160
 They shift the cell into the healthy oxidized condition.

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:27.160
 Right. Well, that's a good thing, obviously.

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:31.160
 So how about-- okay, so naringenin.

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:34.160
 Naringenin has received a reasonable amount of press attention here

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:41.160
 and also I've seen quite a bit of material on PubMed doing trials with naringenin.

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:46.160
 And this obviously is one of those things in grapefruit peel.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.160
 And orange juice.

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.160
 Orange juice, exactly. Orange juice for sure.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:53.160
 But they certainly mentioned that the content within the peel

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.160
 and the membranes of the citrus family, both oranges and lemons,

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:59.160
 but specifically here in grapefruit.

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:02.160
 Yep, marmalade is a great drug.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.160
 That's interesting. I don't know if my wife's listening,

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:08.160
 but I always, always started my day with--

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:11.160
 it was bad then, it was toast, but marmalade.

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.160
 And every morning I had marmalade for breakfast.

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:17.160
 Anyway, so the benefits of naringenin.

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:21.160
 Do you see any other benefits or the way that you would understand naringenin

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:27.160
 to have a kind of antioxidant, antiviral too?

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:33.160
 I mean, the research for naringenin was based on herpes virus.

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:37.160
 So they use both naringenin and hesperidin,

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.160
 which comes from orange and lemon peels,

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:43.160
 as well as the membranes that join the fruits within the orange or the lemon,

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:46.160
 acting as antiviral.

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:49.160
 Knowing what you know about those flavonoids,

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:52.160
 would you understand that mechanism in any other way?

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:57.160
 No, I think it's exactly the same mechanism that aspirin has

00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.160
 for its antiviral function,

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:04.160
 a pro-oxidative cell restorative function.

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.160
 Interesting. All right.

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:10.160
 So you're still very much on the side of cell energy

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:15.160
 and the organization that energy brings as being a route towards

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:19.160
 restoring the cell and restoring health.

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:21.160
 Okay. All right.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:24.160
 I don't know if we have enough time because it's four minutes to eight,

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:30.160
 but I wanted to break into pomegranate and the extract from the rind.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:34.160
 When they had done experiments and trials with this substance

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:42.160
 mixed with zinc against herpes 1 with acyclovir-resistant herpes virus,

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:47.160
 there was a marked increase in antiviral activity with this zinc

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:50.160
 and pomegranate rind extract.

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:53.160
 Do you know, would you have anything quickly to say about zinc?

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.160
 Because I know in the past you've mentioned it topically,

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.160
 perhaps as being effective.

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:04.160
 I suspect that it is sort of like a cofactor for vitamin A.

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:09.160
 Both of them are very important for healthy protein synthesis.

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:14.160
 I've experienced when I was about 50,

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:18.160
 I had aging eyebrows starting to get stiff,

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:24.160
 and I found with a zinc supplement or a vitamin A supplement,

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:30.160
 either one would reverse the age properties of those eyebrows.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:37.160
 And I think that's because they accelerate normal differentiated protein synthesis

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:45.160
 and oppose the degraded estrogen excitation reductive process.

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:48.160
 Interesting. Okay. Well, thanks so much for your time.

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:51.160
 Next month, I think we'll carry on where we left off

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:54.160
 with some of the other antiviral medicinal plants

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:58.160
 and how you'd see their effects physiologically

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.160
 and how you would describe those effects

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:04.160
 as well as further work on another subject

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:07.160
 that hopefully we'll get a chance to talk about next month.

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:09.160
 Thanks so much for your time. Okay.

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:12.160
 Okay. So for those people who have listened and haven't called in

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:15.160
 and for those people who've listened and called in,

00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:17.160
 thanks so much for joining.

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:25.160
 Dr. Peat's website can be found www.raypeat.com.

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:31.160
 He's got a fully referenced library, if you like, of different diseases

00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:35.160
 and how his research as well as bringing up research

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:40.160
 that was done 80 or 100 years ago, which was very valid scientific research,

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:46.160
 which unfortunately as time goes by, gets corrupted with the new paradigm,

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:50.160
 unfortunately, how that is explained scientifically,

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.160
 they're fully referenced.

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:57.160
 And we can always be reached, our business is Western Botanical Medicine.

00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:02.160
 On our website, www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com,

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.160
 I've archived all of our shows.

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:10.160
 And before long here, there will be a pretty comprehensive Instagram website also,

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.160
 which will have all of Dr. Peat's quotes

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:18.160
 and all of his radio show excerpts related to specific subjects.

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:25.160
 I think it will be a great free website, information place to actually go

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:29.160
 and get some current real words from Dr. Peat.

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.160
 There will be audio files as well as excerpts.

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.160
 So thanks so much for joining us.

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.160
 Until 3rd Friday of next month, good night.
