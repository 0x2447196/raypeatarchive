00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.280
 - Well, welcome to the Get Fit With Jodel podcast.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.520
 I am as usual Jodel and you know what?

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.560
 Dr. Raymond Pete is back on the podcast.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.080
 He's with me again and he needs no introduction

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.440
 for most of you that follow my podcast.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.560
 We are some repeat lovers here.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.040
 So, but if you do wanna learn about Dr. Pete

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.400
 and you're new to the podcast,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.180
 I invite you to check out his amazingly informational,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.440
 chock full of information website that raypeet.com

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.160
 that's R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.440
 And we're gonna dive right in

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.060
 because I wanna thank all of you

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.120
 who submitted questions for Dr. Pete.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.560
 I think both he and I really enjoy answering

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.920
 these questions and I love hearing his input on them.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.120
 So we are gonna jump right in.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.060
 Dr. Pete, welcome to the podcast.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.520
 - Thanks.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.680
 - Yeah, so I'm gonna start with my own question

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.080
 that I have for you that I've been really curious

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.920
 to know about.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.880
 I kind of put mine at the top of the list here.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.840
 But what are your thoughts on Chinese medicine

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.000
 and something that I'm learning about called liver heat?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.140
 Now I'm not trained in Chinese medicine,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.880
 but I love learning Ayurveda and Chinese medicine

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.400
 and applying it to my clientele and to myself.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.080
 And I was wondering your thoughts

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.880
 on how to achieve good liver balance.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.080
 And if you feel that liver heat or liver stagnation

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.000
 is actually an issue in a lot of people.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.920
 - Yeah, the Chinese over thousands of years

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.680
 accumulated lots of good knowledge.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.680
 But the idea of Chinese traditional medicine

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.200
 isn't a monolithic thing.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.640
 It varies by regions, for example.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.360
 So there are many traditional Chinese medicines.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.760
 And I think many of them are somewhat useless

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.320
 or maybe even harmful.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.320
 But they do have probably, in total,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.520
 there's probably more useful medication available

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.480
 in Chinese medicine than in American pharmaceutical

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.360
 or in medicine, just because it's such a vast field

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.300
 of knowledge.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.640
 But it's based on basically natural substances

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.840
 and a lot of the knowledge is metaphoric.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.680
 Like when I was in Mexico, I learned that the plans

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.080
 that were, for example, something that was prescribed

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.080
 for anemia in different areas.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.400
 It happened that when you cooked up the leaves

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.400
 or twigs or whatever, they were plants

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.720
 that produced a bright red solution,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.320
 even though they were hugely different chemicals.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.280
 It was the connection between the redness of the herb

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.480
 and the perceived lack of redness of the blood

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.520
 of an anemic person.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.520
 So it wasn't scientific at all.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.120
 And if it happened to work, it was really just accidental.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.040
 And so those things, if you have hundreds

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.640
 of people doing that, sometimes you'll hit on a drug

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.480
 that works and that'll be preserved.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.520
 So it'll be something that started as a metaphor,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.820
 but turned out to have an empirical value.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.920
 - And as far as like the liver heat,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.240
 when in Chinese medicine, they talk about liver heat

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.760
 is like liver inflammation or liver stagnation.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.160
 What say you about that?

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.080
 - The gut and the liver are really our basic

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:23.640
 deepest interaction with the world

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.700
 of chemistry and nutrition.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:36.640
 It happens that the liver is necessarily involved

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.520
 in all of our chemical reactions.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.520
 And you can say that fixing the liver

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.540
 is going to improve every condition.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.600
 But the way they go about fixing the liver

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.640
 is again, sometimes very metaphorical

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.920
 and sometimes unscientific.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.920
 But very often if you attend to the liver,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.680
 you're very often going to get things right.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.640
 - For sure.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.460
 What's one of your top tips for if somebody knows

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.160
 they have liver inflammation

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.960
 or some sort of liver issue going on,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.760
 what would you say would be the first line

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.980
 of defense for them?

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.440
 - Laxatives and anti-inflammatory substances

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.040
 because irritation of the bowel necessarily

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.600
 produces irritation of the liver.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.600
 The bowel is constantly either protecting the liver

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.720
 from toxins or letting them through into the liver.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.760
 So if your intestine is inflamed and not working very well,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.440
 it's going to hurt your liver.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.320
 So laxatives and anti-inflammatories

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.200
 are the first defense of the liver.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.800
 - Okay, good to know.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.840
 Now, one other question I had was there's a lot out there

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.640
 on mono diets where somebody's just going to use one food

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.920
 or substance to cleanse the body.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.560
 And I've recently come across one

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.240
 that I think you might approve of.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.240
 Since you are a big fan of milk,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.520
 there's something coming out in the biotoxic illness

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.960
 community called a milk cleanse,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.640
 where this is a mono diet

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.800
 where somebody would only drink milk for eight days.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.620
 What are your thoughts on that?

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.120
 What do you think about that?

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.800
 - Sometimes it's extended to a month.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.640
 - Okay.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.920
 - And it can be very powerful

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.920
 because the milk contains antibiotic ingredients

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.920
 and multiple anti-inflammatory sedative,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.760
 as well as nutritional substances.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.760
 And really the only thing it lacks to live on for a year

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:16.000
 is iron, you're an adult living on pure milk

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.600
 for more than a year.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.720
 So, it's just profoundly therapeutic

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.400
 to do it for a week or more, up to a month.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.240
 - Fantastic.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.400
 Yeah, it's really intriguing

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.400
 because when you think about it,

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.200
 milk has all the macronutrients.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.520
 It has fat, it has protein, it has carbohydrates.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.720
 So, you're not really fasting in any sense

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.080
 'cause you're getting a lot of food

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.520
 and you're getting a lot of protein and you're getting a lot

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.760
 of food and you're getting a lot of food and you're getting

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.640
 a lot of food.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.280
 So, it's not really fasting in any sense

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.280
 'cause you're getting all your macros

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.160
 and it's got tons of minerals in it.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.920
 So, yeah, when I was thinking about it,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.720
 I'm like, you know, that makes a really good sense

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.520
 as far as being a really good mono diet or a cleanse.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:09.160
 - And since stress generally increases inflammation

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.640
 and that turns on the angiotensin system

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.240
 that activates the adrenals and albasterone

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.240
 and that activates the parathyroid glands

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:29.640
 and the parathyroids turn off respiratory energy production

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.480
 as a way of hiding from stress.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:41.760
 The way serotonin is closely involved in albasterone

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.760
 and parathyroid hormone and serotonin is a way

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.400
 and it's an important factor on turning on hibernation,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.560
 turning off metabolic energy.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.880
 And since high calcium intake turns off

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.920
 the parathyroid gland, it restores energy production

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.120
 and most people are running around stress to the degree

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.760
 that their parathyroid and angiotensin

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.760
 and albasterone serotonin systems are unnecessarily active.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:28.800
 And so it is equivalent to being hypothyroid.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.200
 When the stress turns off your metabolism,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.640
 it does exactly what hypothyroidism does.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.680
 And calcium in sufficient amounts,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.520
 like on a pure milk diet,

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.520
 that's going to very strongly inhibit your parathyroid hormone

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.760
 meaning that it very strongly increases your metabolic rate,

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:01.320
 gets your liver active, providing stabilized glucose

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.880
 and detoxifying processes

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.880
 so that any accumulated toxins from your fat

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.960
 and other tissues will be very efficiently

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.080
 detoxified and excreted.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.880
 So a pure milk diet is very similar

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.560
 to giving adequate thyroid supplementation

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.240
 to get the whole energy system

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.760
 and detoxifying system going again.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.760
 - Oh, wow, I'm so glad I asked this question

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.800
 because like truth be told, lay everything on the table.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.480
 I actually did this cleanse, this eight day cleanse.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.200
 I've done it twice now with raw goat's milk.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.200
 And in eight days, I've had better results with my health

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.960
 than I've had trying to get past this toxic mold exposure

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.720
 for the last four years.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.920
 So I completely agree with you that this type of approach

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.200
 is healing on many levels, the liver, the thyroid,

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.040
 because I've seen it with my own two eyes

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.400
 and I'm gonna be podcasting about it soon too

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.760
 with the creator that put together this little milk cleanse

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.080
 that I specifically did.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.080
 So I just wanted your two cents and I'm so glad I asked.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.880
 - I have a friend who has a lot of big dogs

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.880
 and his grandkids have some goats

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.880
 that they milk and sell the goat milk.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.880
 So there's always a generous amount of goat milk

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.880
 and over the last several years when he discovered

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.680
 the good effects of milk on himself and friends,

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:52.720
 he had a dog that was injured almost fatally in the fight.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:59.560
 And he gave it sugar for immediate recovery,

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.960
 but then gave it a pure milk diet

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.480
 and recovered very fast.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.200
 So that started him being interested

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.160
 in the therapeutic properties.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.160
 And in one of the fights, a dog's eyeball

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.960
 was bitten and deflated and disappeared.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.560
 So there was just a red socket

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:30.120
 and he put that dog on a pure milk diet.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.200
 And I guess it was three or four weeks,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.200
 he noticed in this empty red socket,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:47.080
 he noticed what looked like a cornea or lens developing.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.480
 And over a period of six weeks or two months,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.040
 a new eyeball appeared.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.880
 - Oh, wow.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.000
 - And with a couple of old dogs

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.640
 who had gone blind from cataracts,

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.240
 he put them on milk diet

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.600
 and they recovered from their cataracts.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.600
 So the fresh goat milk was apparently responsible

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.080
 for regenerating, in one case, a whole eyeball

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.360
 and the other restoring clarity to the lenses.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.760
 - Okay, so then the cliche stands,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.680
 milk really does do a body good.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.240
 So yeah, I think we've heard it here, folks.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.040
 You can definitely try a mono diet of milk.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.280
 Well, I think we'll jump into the next question.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.520
 So this is from SM, it says,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.200
 "Could you please ask Dr. Pete how you would know

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.160
 if you are taking too much thyroid supplement?

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.080
 For example, I'm taking one whole tablet a day

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.000
 of Sinoples split into three doses

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 and half a tablet of Sinomel split into two doses.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.360
 My underarm temperature is around 98 degrees Fahrenheit

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.760
 and resting heart rate around 60 beats per minute.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.120
 I generally feel a bit fatigued

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.720
 wondering if I should up the dose

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.680
 and how would I know if I'm taking too much?

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.880
 So I guess the question is,

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.440
 how do you know if you're taking too much

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.840
 or too little, Dr. Pete?

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:22.880
 - A few times, for example,

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.440
 if I was taking a two-grain dose of armored thyroid

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.720
 during the winter, every spring I found

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.040
 that I started overheating and getting out of breath

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.800
 if I kept taking that amount.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.400
 So I learned that in the spring,

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:48.400
 I had to go from two grains down to a half a grain.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:54.880
 And what you are most likely to notice

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.480
 when you're taking more than enough

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.480
 is that you're just standing up

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.040
 and walking across the room, for example,

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:10.200
 you'll feel increased warmth and breathe.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.560
 You'll be breathing harder

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.320
 and temporarily get out of breath

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.360
 just for walking 30 feet or so.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:24.720
 So your heart beats very powerfully

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.720
 and quickly, usually going 95 or 100 beats per minute

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.400
 with a very hard, firm pulse,

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.440
 not a rapid, weak beat.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:44.400
 And you're very easily overheated

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.760
 and get out of breath,

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.360
 but you also recover your breath quickly.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.600
 - Okay.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.880
 Okay, some good symptoms to look for there

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.320
 than SM.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.920
 Okay, so UPCAR at BECOM asks

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.920
 whether a succinate source of vitamin E

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.480
 is acceptable to consume.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.720
 Now, when I looked into succinate a while back,

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.480
 that source seems to be really good for cancer prevention.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.400
 Yeah, I had just seen some studies on it relating to cancer,

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.400
 but as far as if it's safe or acceptable to consume,

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.520
 that's something that I guess

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.520
 I'll have to look into a bit further.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.080
 - The vitamin E should be described

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.080
 according to its actual composition

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.640
 as a tocopherol,

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:42.000
 which of the isomers of the tocopherol it is.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.240
 - Okay, good to know.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.040
 Okay, White Lotus asks,

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.640
 I found three masses in my breast

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.400
 along with a two centimeter mass in my lymph node

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.560
 via ultrasound.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.400
 And reading further down,

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.520
 she has a pretty low TSH and T4 within range,

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.080
 but it seems to be her numbers are getting worse now

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.040
 and ultrasound showed an enlarged thyroid,

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.400
 but otherwise normal.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.480
 Then she learned about you

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.880
 and she started taking her temperature

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.800
 and implementing kind of the way that you describe eating

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.400
 and her temperature is 97.4 in the morning

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.440
 and it can get to 98.4 midday.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.320
 Her adrenals seem to be involved

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.480
 'cause her pulse goes from 84 to 94 to 110, 135

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.080
 when she's stressed

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.480
 and will sometimes go up and down

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.840
 within the few seconds that she's taking the pulse.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.680
 And ever since COVID, it seems her heart rate is unstable.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.120
 She can feel a change when she takes progesterone

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.520
 and thyroid and she started aspirin,

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.360
 but it might irritate her stomach sometimes.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.800
 Would she still be considered hypothyroid

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.400
 even though her TSH is so low and T4 is high

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.400
 and should she continue on the protocol?

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.240
 Yeah, go ahead.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.880
 - What exactly was your TSH number?

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.720
 Do you have a-

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.960
 - Yeah, 0.35.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.240
 - 0.25?

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.080
 - 0.35.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.080
 - Oh, that's,

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:19.080
 it's not inconsistent with hypothyroidism.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:26.600
 So experimenting with the dose is important,

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.600
 but you don't respond properly to the thyroid supplement

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:38.480
 if your body is very saturated with polyunsaturated fats

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.440
 or if your diet contains polyunsaturated fats

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.320
 or if you're getting too much phosphate in the diet

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:53.320
 from meat or fish or nuts or legumes or grains

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:58.040
 will interfere with thyroid function.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.800
 Calcium promotes thyroid function.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.840
 Vitamin D promotes it by letting you use the calcium.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.480
 So you have to look at the whole picture

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.480
 and protein, sodium, calcium

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.080
 are all things that increase your metabolic rate

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:26.560
 and will help to, if it's just an inflammatory thing

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:33.120
 like a plugged milk duct, for example,

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:39.400
 the increased metabolic rate should clear it up quickly.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.920
 - I'm so glad you brought up the PUFAs

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.280
 because I think that so many people just think,

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.280
 okay, I'm going to take a thyroid supplement

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.360
 and I'm going to take an aspirin

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.920
 and take some progesterone and all my problems will go away,

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.640
 but you really do have to dial in the nutrition

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.200
 and you have to look at the sources

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.880
 of those polyunsaturated fatty acids that are coming in

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.480
 'cause they are anti-thyroid,

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.120
 so they're not going to help you in the end.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.840
 So yeah, I'm really glad that you brought that up as well.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.560
 She has another question.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.160
 What are Ray Pete's thoughts on alcohol, especially champagne?

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:18.240
 - In very small quantities,

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.560
 like a half a teaspoon per day,

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:29.000
 it has very powerful anti-inflammatory

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.880
 and potentially anti-aging effects.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.880
 There was a study of brain age pigment or lipophuscan

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:43.360
 and they found that vitamin E caused it to be removed

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.640
 from the living cells, but as a control,

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.360
 vitamin E had been dissolved in alcohol.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.000
 They found that just an alcohol supplement

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 was enough to remove the age pigment from the brain cells.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.680
 And that is probably because of its very powerful

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.680
 anti-inflammatory effect or antioxidant effect,

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:16.280
 but to achieve that, it's just almost microscopic

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:21.280
 amount of ethyl alcohol that will serve as an antioxidant.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:27.160
 - I'm just laughing because I'm thinking

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.520
 of all the people listening to this,

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.360
 but now their wine glass is gonna have half a teaspoon

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.120
 of champagne. (laughs)

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:39.120
 - Well, champagne is what, maybe 10% alcohol,

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:46.720
 very small, somewhere between eight and 10%, I think.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:52.040
 So to have a gram of alcohol,

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:57.000
 you could have almost an ounce of champagne.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.360
 (laughs)

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.880
 Well, thankfully I'm not a drinker,

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.840
 so it doesn't apply to me, but everybody out there,

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.440
 go get your little teaspoon

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.440
 and measure out your champagne next time, so yeah.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.600
 Okay, gcristy626 asks,

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.440
 is the vitamin K2 in MCT oil safe?

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.200
 Some sources list MCT that can be derived from soy.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.920
 What's the best way to get K2,

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.120
 particularly if supplementing with aspirin

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.600
 to prevent bleeding?

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:36.880
 - Many of the products are in MCT oil,

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:42.160
 and it depends on the person and the quantity,

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:47.160
 but orally ingesting MCT has the possibility

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.560
 of increasing sensitivity to allergens.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:00.880
 For example, they found that you could create a peanut allergy

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.840
 by combining a little bit of MCT

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.560
 with a little bit of a peanut substance.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:14.560
 So it can have a very dangerous effect on the intestine.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.840
 So I think it's good to avoid all of the oral supplements

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.280
 containing MCT on the skin

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.800
 as far as I know they're safe.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.800
 And so when I think I've been,

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.040
 for example, taking antibiotics

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:40.040
 that would reduce the K-producing bacteria in my intestine

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.880
 and using aspirin,

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:48.880
 which will inactivate the substances

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.160
 that are anti-inflammatory,

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.080
 to counteract that,

00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:00.080
 I will either eat an extra amount of liver

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:06.560
 or I will open some of the vitamin K capsules

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:12.560
 and spread three or four capsules on areas within skin.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.960
 - Good idea.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.440
 As far as like when you say not taking MCT oils though,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.360
 so people really just need to get it

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.360
 from when they're using coconut oil,

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.480
 like you recommend,

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.480
 just getting the natural medium-chain triglycerides

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.440
 from that, yeah?

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:37.000
 - Yeah, many places call MCT a type of coconut oil,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.480
 but it's really a totally unnatural thing

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.320
 that never occurs in nature,

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.480
 even though the components do,

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.480
 but they are arranged in a unique, manufactured way

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:59.600
 that the arrangement has very powerful biological effects.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.640
 - Okay, very good.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.080
 Ellie Z asks,

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.520
 is supplemental calcium carbonate

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.200
 from undisclosed sources dangerous

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.640
 due to potential heavy metals

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.880
 or do benefits outweigh the risk?

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.200
 - Yeah, it can come from a mine

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:25.880
 that contains very harmful amounts of heavy metals.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.880
 So eggshells and coral are relatively clean.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:36.360
 Eggshells were the cleanest by analysis,

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.240
 slightly better than coral calcium carbonate.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.920
 - Okay, good to know.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.200
 Dave Fit asks,

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.320
 would like to know about calcium to phosphorus ratio

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.200
 and maybe magnesium too?

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.600
 Dr. Pete talks a lot about getting lots of calcium upwards

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.680
 of 2000 plus milligrams a day

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.360
 and talks about reducing phosphorus,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.760
 but I've never heard where he'd like to see phosphorus intake.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.640
 Is there, or there is a decent amount of phosphorus in milk,

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.240
 so I'm curious what he recommends.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.640
 New big fan of Ray Pete, he says.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.440
 - Milk has, if you're drinking two or three quarts of milk

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.360
 a day, you're getting enough calcium.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.720
 If your thyroid is functioning,

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.720
 a low thyroid person loses magnesium.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:32.520
 The cells simply can't retain it very long.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:37.200
 You might eat a huge batch of cooked spinach

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.840
 and have the symptoms subside for several hours

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:47.080
 or a day, but if your thyroid is low,

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:51.600
 your cells will lose it and the symptoms will recur.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:56.600
 So you can get along on a surprisingly low level

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:02.440
 of magnesium if your thyroid is staying good.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.280
 - Okay.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:08.280
 - And milk is a very good source of magnesium

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.920
 if your thyroid is in good condition.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.720
 - Okay, cool.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.520
 All right, Dil R.R., D-Y-L-R-R asks,

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.720
 can Ray please talk about how an adult can grow taller

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.120
 after growth was stunted due to malnutrition?

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.560
 Is it possible, Dr. Pete?

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:32.400
 - Low thyroid people often don't finish growth

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.880
 until they're in their 40s, and malnutrition can be

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.340
 a major cause of a low thyroid function.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:49.200
 I didn't start taking a thyroid supplement,

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.640
 even though I suspected it for many years,

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.640
 but I had a high metabolic rate and so I was close to,

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:02.160
 I think it was 40 when I started supplementing it.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.240
 And when I had moved into that house,

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.240
 there were kids sharing the house

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:15.120
 and everyone marked their height on the door frame.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:20.120
 And after about three or four years

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.920
 after I had started taking the thyroid supplement,

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.200
 I was moving out and I checked my height

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.540
 against the mark made 10 years earlier.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:36.580
 And found that I had grown an inch after the age of 40

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:41.740
 because of the thyroid supplement.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.580
 - That's so great.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:47.580
 - And I mentioned that to a tall woman

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:52.180
 just around the time I, and myself,

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.020
 and she said exactly the same thing happened to her.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.580
 She grew an inch when she was 45.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.440
 All things are possible.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.500
 Okay, so Laura Dana Nuculi asks,

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.180
 thank you for these shows, I love them.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.880
 And you and Dr. Pete question,

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.620
 I cannot tolerate progesterone and most things

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.840
 that are recommended like aspirin makes me really cold.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.340
 And progesterone, even a small amount,

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:21.700
 even progesty gives me a strong estrogenic reaction,

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.000
 lack of sleep, sore breasts, long menses, et cetera.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.260
 Same with pregnant alone,

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:27.940
 that gives me an allergic reaction.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.100
 I'm following Ray Pete's work for quite a few years now

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.340
 and most of the nutritional advice.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.120
 I'm on thyroid support and my temps and pulse are okay-ish

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.120
 and getting better.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.420
 Is there anything I can do to tolerate progesterone better?

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:44.460
 Main thing I want to do is improve working memory,

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.820
 especially with the capacity to focus in processing speed.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:51.760
 I'm 43 year old woman with long-term iron deficiency.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.720
 Thank you so much.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:59.500
 The iron deficiency diagnosis is usually mistaken

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:07.660
 because the iron stores tend to be hidden inside cells.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:13.480
 And the closest you can get with a blood test

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.980
 is the transfer and saturation percent.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:24.860
 And it should be something like maybe 25 to 30%

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:29.260
 is an okay saturation.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:34.260
 But a low red blood cell count can be caused by many things,

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:40.420
 a copper deficiency, for example, or too much estrogen.

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:48.460
 If you look at female animals versus males,

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:52.100
 they always have a lower red cell count.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:57.100
 And that's because estrogen inhibits bone marrow activity.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:06.620
 So often people poison themselves

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:12.420
 trying to cure iron deficiency anemia

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.420
 when it's really a thyroid supplement or trace minerals.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:23.380
 Such as selenium and copper or the B vitamins

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:28.880
 to get the red blood cell production up.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:37.300
 The progesterone by opposing that anemia

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:42.020
 of producing effective estrogen

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.540
 and by activating the thyroid gland

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:50.540
 will itself improve the anemia

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:53.840
 increasing red cell production in women.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:32:00.020
 And the amount and way that you use progesterone

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:06.020
 is very important.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:16.460
 In the oil form, it can be absorbed through the skin,

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:20.260
 but it's about 10 times more efficient

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.340
 if you take it orally.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.580
 But since vitamin E is a very viscous oil,

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:32.620
 it tends to be at least a disgusting thing

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:36.840
 to swallow very much of.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.340
 And it's better if you mix it with butter

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:44.140
 or other food so that you don't notice

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.540
 the consistency of it.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:53.500
 Then it will express its progesterone like activity.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.940
 And progesterone at every level,

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:02.940
 its basic activity is to antagonize estrogen.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:10.620
 So as soon as you feel a progesterone effect,

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:16.580
 it is activating your thyroid gland and the large thyroid.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:21.900
 That means that it's accumulating the material

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.500
 with which to make thyroid hormone,

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.540
 but it's unable to excrete it

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.420
 because your body is dominated by estrogen,

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:35.420
 which locks the enzymes that break down the thyroglobulin

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.620
 forming the hormone for secretion.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:45.620
 And so if a person has noticeably enlarged thyroid,

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.940
 it's better to shrink the thyroid gland

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.980
 back to the normal size

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:55.340
 because occasionally if a person takes enough thyroid,

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:59.260
 enough progesterone to block

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.960
 that anti thyroid effect of estrogen,

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:09.300
 the sudden release of the inhibition

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.440
 and the activating effect of the progesterone

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:17.340
 on those enzymes that release hormone

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.200
 from the thyroid globulin,

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:24.320
 that can put you into a hyper thyroid state,

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:30.500
 raising your pulse rate to 110 to 120 at rest.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:35.500
 220 at rest until the gland normalizes itself.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:41.180
 I experienced that myself

00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.320
 and I've seen it in two or three other people.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.700
 And generally they say that

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.620
 they never felt better in their life,

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:54.020
 but if they happen to go to a doctor,

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.820
 the doctor would want to destroy their thyroid gland

00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:02.700
 to cure them, but if they just wait it out

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.480
 for a couple of months, that corrects itself.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.260
 - Okay, another question from White Lotus is,

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:13.420
 are there any breads that are okay, like sourdough or rye?

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.700
 - If it's real sourdough.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.540
 - Right.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:22.900
 - A lot of places just add acid to bread,

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:30.260
 the actual way to make a nutritious and healthful sourdough

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:37.280
 is to soak the flour for 10 or 12 hours.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:42.620
 With or without the yeast, you could add the yeast later.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:45.740
 It doesn't matter because it's the soaking

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:50.740
 that turns the starch and protein, the gluten of the flour,

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:58.280
 and it has to be living flour, it can't be sterile flour.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:03.280
 So it has to be vital with enzymes that can convert

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:09.140
 the gluten and starch into the amino acids

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:14.460
 and sugar that allows the yeast to leaven the bread.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:22.540
 And so the bread loses its rubbery, fluffy texture

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:28.420
 and tends to be denser and weak, but very good tasting

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:33.740
 and very, very non-toxic.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:40.620
 50 years ago when I was interested in making bread,

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:44.940
 I had noticed that a single slice of bread

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.460
 from the grocery store would give me insomnia.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:54.340
 But when I baked my own well-soaked sourdough bread

00:36:54.340 --> 00:37:03.420
 almost completely free of gluten, it tasted so good.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:09.300
 A couple of times ate a whole loaf of it at bedtime

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.220
 and slept perfectly.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.180
 - I'm sure.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.180
 - Very, very digestible stuff.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.420
 - Yeah, yeah, but I'm so glad to you.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.900
 I agree completely if you can make it yourself

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.740
 or buy the highest quality fermented loaf of sourdough,

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.700
 then yeah, I think it's good.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.740
 Okay, Julian says, raise thoughts on consistent

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.060
 nightly Benadryl usage for lowering serotonin

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.540
 and helping sleep and allergies, thanks.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:44.140
 - As far as I know, there's no specific harm done by it.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:49.860
 It's something that you should consider a temporary crutch

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:55.180
 because you can fix the problem of excess histamine

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.740
 and serotonin.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:00.180
 For example, lowering your estrogen.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:06.660
 Estrogen is the motor behind excess safe histamine

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.480
 and serotonin activity.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:13.620
 So getting the estrogen under control with thyroid,

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:17.340
 progesterone, vitamin D and calcium for example,

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:20.380
 will bring on sleep.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:27.140
 - Sometimes I wish I had canned audience applause for you

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.860
 because some of your answers are just so like,

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:32.140
 yay, we need like canned audience applause.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:37.140
 Okay, Joseph asks options for people working through

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.780
 depersonalization panic disorder.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:44.780
 - The panic part of it is from the falling blood sugar

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:58.140
 and excitatory effects of lactic acid.

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:04.420
 And the lactic acid is overproduced

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:08.020
 because you aren't making enough carbon dioxide

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:11.660
 to suppress the lactic acid production.

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:16.660
 And so making lactic acid blocks your ability

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:21.300
 to produce the sedative carbon dioxide

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.620
 and to keep your blood sugar up

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.380
 by the efficient oxidative metabolism.

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:30.980
 And so correcting your thyroid.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:38.100
 A first aid can be inhaling carbon dioxide

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:43.100
 by re-breathing in the paper bag for a couple of minutes.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:48.580
 - Okay, and NCgirl9FI asks looking forward

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.620
 to the answer to my question.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.940
 I've been following a repeat diet for a year now.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.420
 Raw carrot salad, milk, progesterone

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.340
 and taking a little bit of thyroid.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.220
 I'm still getting tension headaches,

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.220
 especially around menstruation.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.860
 My doctor wants to put me on estrogen.

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:05.860
 Oh no.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.900
 Is there anything else I should try first?

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.740
 Could this be high serotonin?

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.860
 Thanks Dr. Pete.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:18.060
 - Yeah, the important thing with progesterone use

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:23.060
 when you have a symptom like a menstrual headache or PMS

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:29.220
 or essentially any estrogen poisoning effect

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:35.860
 is to use the progesterone cyclic plate.

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:40.380
 The body produces it for two weeks every month

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.060
 and then lets up on the production.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.620
 If your liver experiences a high level

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.260
 for more than two weeks,

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:56.260
 its enzymes are disposing of the estrogen

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.980
 as fast as you make it.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:04.780
 And so you're losing the potency of the progesterone

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:09.780
 if you don't take a break of at least a week every month.

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:13.980
 And you get the most potent effect

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:18.780
 if you start it part way through the luteal phase

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:25.060
 and use it with the intent of activating your thyroid

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:29.460
 and interfering with the estrogen effect.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:34.380
 And you can use thyroid the same way,

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:39.380
 especially if you have the active T3 form of thyroid,

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:44.420
 such as Cytomel or Sinomel.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:49.420
 And you can use that during the luteal phase

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:54.500
 when you have the symptoms to lower the estrogen.

00:41:55.700 --> 00:42:00.380
 If you use too much of it,

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.420
 you'll lower the estrogen to the point

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.260
 where you stop menstruating.

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:09.460
 But for example, someone who has been hemorrhaging constantly

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.980
 couldn't turn off their menstruation.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.300
 In just two or three days,

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:21.300
 they were able to absolutely turn off the menstruation

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:26.740
 by supplementing T3 and that's menorrhagia

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:33.540
 or excessive menstruation is a common sign

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:35.420
 of hypothyroidism.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:41.660
 And to get your thyroid activity up,

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.580
 it requires good nutrition,

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:50.020
 high ratio of calcium to phosphate,

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:54.660
 if possible, a one-to-one ratio is very good,

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:57.300
 but many people on a standard diet

00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:02.300
 are getting five times as much phosphate as calcium.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.780
 And that dissipates your energy,

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:09.020
 blocks the thyroid function and so on.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.380
 - For sure.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:16.020
 Okay, so next one is from Vain R. Prestus.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:20.940
 Ray has previously mentioned that being slightly hyperthyroid

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.100
 is preferable to being slightly hypo.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.260
 What are the physical markers

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:29.140
 for a properly adjusted thyroid dosage

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.540
 for getting that for that slightly hyperthyroid?

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:39.580
 - It's really hyper according to the standards

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.100
 of medical thinking.

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:47.100
 It's actually a used thyroid condition

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:55.140
 except good thyroid function is almost always considered

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:59.580
 as hyperthyroid by the medical and the doctrines

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:02.460
 that have developed over the last several years.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:10.100
 And good thyroid function should include a resting pulse

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:16.060
 of somewhere in the 85 beats per minute at rest,

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:23.780
 just to maintain all of your detoxifying functions,

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.500
 for example, at a high level.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:31.500
 And your skin should be generally on the moist side.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:37.900
 Your hair should accumulate an oiliness

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:42.460
 if you don't wash it for several days.

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:48.660
 The softness of the skin depends on adequate oil production

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:53.860
 and moisture from the sweat plans.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:58.460
 High estrogen and low thyroid, for example,

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:03.100
 knock out the function of most of your sweat plans

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:07.060
 leading to dry skin, thin skin,

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:10.180
 as well as internal problems

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:15.140
 of stress related degenerative symptoms.

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:20.140
 And alertness as well as alertness during the daytime

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:24.380
 and quick onset of sleep at night.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:30.940
 Many people find that when they're under stress

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.540
 or traveling or something and can't get to sleep,

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:39.460
 five to 10 micrograms of T3

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.780
 by restoring the brain energy

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:47.020
 is creating the relaxed condition

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:50.540
 that will allow deep sleep to come on.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.660
 It's partly a matter of the temperature,

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:57.660
 but partly simply activating energy production.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:03.220
 And the brain is very similar to the muscles

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:09.180
 which can't relax fully if you're hypothyroid.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:15.220
 The secretory organs which might either under function

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:21.300
 or over function, for example,

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:26.300
 excess salivation can happen from hypothyroidism.

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:33.540
 So having everything functioning optimally,

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.700
 having fairly quick transit time

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:41.060
 between eating food and excreting it,

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:45.620
 it should be on the order of one day

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:49.500
 that the average American is three days transit time

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:50.340
 on average.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.180
 - So glad you mentioned all those.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.260
 That'll give people a good symptom picture

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.540
 to think about as far as like if you wanna make sure

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.220
 you're where you need to be, so.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.780
 XR, oh, go ahead, yeah.

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:09.260
 - The intestine should be sterile

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:14.260
 and the people in a person with good thyroid activity.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:19.980
 All of the secretions and peristalsis should be so active

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:25.700
 that no germ can live between your esophagus

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:32.300
 and your end of the small intestine where the colon begins.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.340
 All of that should be free of bacteria.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:40.340
 But the average American has a bacterial living

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:44.020
 partly up at least in the small intestine.

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:46.300
 The lower your thyroid is,

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:51.300
 the more infested with bacteria your small intestine becomes.

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:54.980
 - Okay, very good.

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:58.980
 Okay, XR asks, what are Ray's predictions in the future

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.260
 regarding COVID and the vaccines?

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:04.500
 What will the vaccines cause in his opinion?

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:12.700
 - Oh, they cause exactly the same kind of symptom

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:17.740
 that the infection does, often worse.

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:22.460
 And it's been known for decades

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:27.460
 that a viral infection, influenza, for example,

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:32.460
 or the other things that cause cold-like symptoms,

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:38.060
 that isn't just a respiratory condition,

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:42.060
 but it affects your digestive system.

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:47.060
 Often the first symptom is in your digestive system.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:52.820
 And that's because of the interference

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:55.860
 with your anti-inflammatory processes

00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:01.460
 of the viral infection, such as influenza or COVID.

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:07.980
 And the vaccine, so-called vaccine is,

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:14.780
 it's a method of producing the toxic part of the virus,

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:22.700
 a spike protein, which knocks out our anti-inflammatory

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:28.540
 ACE2 enzyme, which destroys angiotensin

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:32.100
 and knocks out inflammation of all sorts.

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:37.100
 And in the process, restores metabolic activity

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:41.180
 because it has been suppressed by the inflammation.

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:46.540
 And so the lingering effects

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:51.540
 of the vaccine are going to be just about the same

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:56.860
 as the lingering effects of a viral infection

00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:02.940
 have been a certain percent, maybe only 1%,

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:07.200
 maybe several percent, will have lifelong,

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:13.380
 recognizable problems resulting from an intense case

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:18.260
 of influenza, for example,

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:22.220
 or from a bad reaction to the vaccine.

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:27.220
 - Okay, last two questions here.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:30.200
 We might kind of tag, we might kind of tag them together

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.980
 because FAB asks, is sugar as carcinogenic

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:36.540
 as we have been told, carcinogenic as we've been told,

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:40.040
 leading to cavities and tooth decay?

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:44.300
 And then Brandon also wants to know surrounding strategies

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.540
 to maintain oral health.

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.580
 It seems some people who transition from a low carb diet

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:51.160
 to a higher carb run into cavities.

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.740
 So having said that, does the pH of the mouth

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:56.780
 matter more than we think?

00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:01.280
 So what about oral health, cavities and such and sugar?

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:06.740
 - Yeah, your saliva should be antiseptic

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:11.740
 and a very neutral pH, very close to a 7 pH.

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:16.740
 And it has antibodies and probably other factors

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:25.380
 that help to keep the mouth sterile

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:30.380
 and prevent the acid-forming, tooth-destroying bacteria.

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:36.860
 But in the absence of that healthy saliva,

00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:43.260
 which depends on the high energy metabolism and good thyroid,

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:47.340
 you can protect your teeth to a great extent

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:52.340
 by having some water dissolved baking soda at hand.

00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:57.500
 And every time you eat something,

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.580
 swish a little bit of the baking soda solution

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:05.580
 in your mouth and swallow it to leave an alkalizing residue

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:08.620
 in the mouth.

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:16.480
 The story about cancer and sugar

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:24.420
 is a horrible misinterpretation of Otto Warburg's work

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:32.460
 in the 1920s in which he showed that cancer

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:38.080
 can't turn off glycolysis by oxidizing glucose

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:46.460
 or other things to carbon dioxide.

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:49.460
 Even in the presence of oxygen

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:57.380
 and the production of adequate energy,

00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:02.380
 the cancer keeps turning glucose into lactic acid.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:08.380
 Cancer has a metabolic effect of wasting glucose.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:15.680
 And so the typical cancer is so metabolically inefficient

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:23.560
 that inside the tumor, there is extreme lack of oxygen

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:30.060
 and glucose both and in order to reduce the oxygen

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:35.280
 in orders of an isolated cancer

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:40.560
 in a person's leg, for example, and in animal experiments.

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:46.400
 They found that if you put an extremely high concentration

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:53.800
 of glucose solution into the artery of feeding the tumor,

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.420
 getting up for the glucose sufficiency created

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:07.240
 by the cancer's metabolic inefficiency,

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:10.840
 getting enough glucose to the tumor,

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.000
 the tumor dissolves, kills itself.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:21.680
 So if you think of it in the actual detailed way

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:32.760
 that the metabolism is being operated,

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:38.480
 you see that glucose is one of the most protective oxygen

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:41.320
 along with glucose.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:46.320
 If you can provide it to the tumor in sufficient amounts,

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:50.820
 the tumor is going to gain the energy it needs

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.600
 to heal the wound.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:57.480
 The cancer is an attempt to heal a tissue

00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:02.480
 without the materials it needs to achieve the healing.

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:05.880
 And glucose is one of those materials.

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:08.320
 If you don't get enough glucose,

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:13.320
 the cancer sends out signals to provide more glucose.

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:18.680
 And to do that, if you aren't eating sugar,

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:23.440
 the only source of glucose in your body

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:28.440
 is to break down protein to turn to glucose.

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:34.080
 And so that's why having a tumor tends to produce

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:38.520
 wasting away of the muscles and the skin

00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:40.280
 and the immune system and so on.

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:46.200
 And so having enough carbohydrate in your diet

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:50.160
 helps to prevent that wasting caused by cancer.

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:54.920
 And ideally it can, along with other things

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:59.920
 can provide the materials the tumor needs to heal itself.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:04.240
 - That's another reason that we don't need to focus

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.680
 on low carb diets.

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:10.480
 So, well, we made it through all the questions, Dr. Pete,

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.400
 you were awesome.

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.240
 And this has been fun as usual.

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.560
 I love learning from you.

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.640
 So keep up what you're doing.

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:20.640
 And if you guys don't have Dr. Pete's newsletter yet,

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.120

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:27.280
 So you can order that mailed order

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.960

 I love every time I get it in my inbox.

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:44.040
 So Dr. Pete, thank you for your time today.

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:46.700
