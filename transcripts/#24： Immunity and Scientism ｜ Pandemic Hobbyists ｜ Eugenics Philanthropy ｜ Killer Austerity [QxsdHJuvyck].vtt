00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Okay, we are live on YouTube. Ray Peat, Georgi Dinkov. Ray, I interrupted you. You were saying some really important, critical things and so I just want to get those on record.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 I was asking you initially about China, Brzezinski, the Rockefeller Technocratic Society, you were mentioning Event 201, Fort Detrick, and kind of the culmination of a bunch of, I don't know, larger global plans and pushing society in a specific direction that has been talked about for a long time.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Yeah, and there was a commission on defense preparations using artificial intelligence that came out about two years ago that said that at the rate Chinese economy has been growing,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 the world will be centered on Chinese production, development of artificial automation, automatic factories, and the U.S. for various reasons would not be able to keep up with that extrapolated progress.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 And that the only way this commission could see to prevent China from taking over the world in 10 years would be to stop the world economy as a whole, turn off, ruin the whole world economy.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 And then these other things, claiming that there was a virus released last November, doing the news releases of a leaky lab and Fort Detrick preparing pathogens,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 all of that reinforced by China's cooperation in creating that huge quarantine that was acting out the plan to ruin the world economy as a way to save the ruling system,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 to keep the U.S. empire intact by ruining everything, meaning ruining small business primarily so that there can be an immediate takeover by monopoly corporations and finance,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 simplify the whole economy with basically everyone being a low wage employee but working to overtake China on the matter of artificial intelligence production.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 I have a question here. So let's say China becomes the leader in artificial intelligence, what are those 1.4 billion people there going to do? What do you think China's idea of its own population would be? How would they participate if eventually everything becomes automated?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 I'm not sure they've thought about that but they have basically a humane concept of how capitalism is working. They have actually almost succeeded in eliminating poverty.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 China was one of the poorest countries when they started and they have actually seriously brought up the lowest economic category.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Okay. So basically this event is similar to that quote you gave once about the Vietnamese and the Americans saying we have to destroy this village to save it from the Vietnamese. So they're doing the same thing now with the world economy to save it from the Chinese, they have to destroy it?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Exactly.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Okay.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 So I was a little bit wrong. They're not in solidarity with China. They're doing all these things to protect what they've built. Is that right?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Yeah. They were taking profits from the industry in China but reached a point where they saw that China as an economy was becoming the center of the world, making the world dependent on their production and that was structurally interfering with the US idea of empires.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 In which military bases were the essence of organization and the Chinese were making the flow of goods the means of organization.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 What does quarantine and lockdown, presuming that's towards a depopulation type of effort, what does that have to do with maintaining the empire? Are the citizenry getting out of control and that's why they have to put these ridiculous measures in place to clamp down on the people?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 That's part of it to justify taking over the internet requiring vaccination and subordination of all sorts. But I think mostly it's part of destroying all of the middle class competition for the giant monopolies.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Do you think technocracy is a worthwhile concept? Is that useful for explaining what's going on? Was it coined by Brzezinski in Between Two Ages?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 Oh no. Veblen was the first person who started talking about how you could eliminate labor and create abundance.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 Then the people who called themselves the technocrats incorporated started, the founder of technocracy knew Veblen and adopted his view of the economy.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 Did you know any of the old technocrats used to drive grey cars with the yellow and red yin yang symbol on the side?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 I didn't know that.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 People thought they were maybe fascist sympathizers or something but they were actually just very naive about how the world works.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 They took these calculations from Veblen and subsequent economists like John Maynard Keynes in 1930.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 He wrote an article saying that by 2030, 100 years from when he wrote it, he said that by discounting plagues and world wars, people won't be working any more than 15 hours a week.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 When I was a kid, that was part of the environment. The work week was getting shorter and that was the predicted future.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 It wasn't just the technocracy people by name but they were outstanding in how optimistic they were that the people who owned things were going to let the engineers run them intelligently and efficiently.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 That constantly was running into interference with concentration of wealth and control.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 The progress towards the 15-hour week was more or less continuous despite those interferences with the engineer category.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 In 1980, it was the turning point. Reagan and the progress of the middle and working class took a sharp turn.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 The GDP kept increasing. Productivity kept increasing but wages started decreasing. The upper 1% and 1/10 of 1% started getting all of the rewards of increasing production.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 The economy started declining. The economy started declining. The economy started declining. The economy started declining and the economy started declining.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 I was listening to a conversation between Patrick Wood and James Corbett. Patrick Wood has written a few books on technocracy. He was important to point out that originally it was more like a Bucky Fuller type of future.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 I think what you said, you're only working a few hours in the future. Rockefeller and Brzezinski and that et al. co-opted the term for their dystopian, brave new world type of future.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Yes, definitely. It started with the CIA and Eisenhower and the Green Revolution.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 It was being applied in agriculture, turning farming into agribusiness and agri-industry rather than producing mixed foods for consumption.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 It was producing soybeans for profit. That started with Rockefeller and Eisenhower in 1952.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 I have a question. If agriculture has been so industrialized to mostly focus on profit and not necessarily produce the foods that people need, then how come it needs such massive subsidies from the government?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 I live in DC and I know some people that are involved in lobbying on behalf of agricultural organizations.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 They're saying that if these farmers, no matter how massive they are in the Midwest, don't get their government subsidies even one season, they're going under.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 The government has been financing the upward distribution of ownership in all sorts of ways.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 The funds going to people owning only 10,000 acres and such was slowing the progress of the great technocrats.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 They're going to let those so-called relatively small farms of 10,000 or 15,000 acres go under to be consumed by the ones controlling a million acres.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 We can step back a little bit. Ray, in one of your newsletters, you quoted Gore Vidal and you said, "The people have no voice because they have no information."

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 That reminded me of – at first, I wasn't sure if it was accurate or not, but William Casey, the CIA director in 1981, he said, "Well, no, our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false."

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Then there's some dispute on whether that quote is real or not. Then Barbara Honegger said she was the one that quoted him.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 She, on Quora, a website of questioning and answers, basically says, "Seriously, this quote is real, and I was the one who said it."

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 I just say that because this is not something that's really – I mean, the concept of fake news is more prevalent than it ever has been, but what is your take having a wide perspective on how the news has changed over time?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 William Casey, the CEO of Google, said, "The public news is getting more controlling, more false, and dumbed down so that they're just giving instructions every day on what you should believe today."

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 It's horrifyingly effective with this plague thing, how people fell for it. Without any data at all, the decisions were made that a new kind of coronavirus was very infectious and very deadly.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 No data in support. My first thought was, "Do they have guilty insider information that it was designed in the lab and they know that to be the case?"

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 If they weren't the designers of it, otherwise, there's no sane reason for saying those things that it's very infectious or very dangerous, because they just weren't doing the tests to see what was making people sick

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 or measuring the changes of sickness in relation to previous years.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 I was looking at the CDC's report, and all of their actual cases and infections and deaths were right on the typical flu season mortality, sickness, and hospitalization.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 As the tests became available by the millions around the first of April, suddenly, flu mortality dropped as fast as the stock market had fallen earlier.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 It was like a cliff falling off as the millions of tests became available, and the steep rise of the news talked about, a sudden gigantic speed of communication caused this vertical rise in the incidents and deaths from the coronavirus.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 But the bigger curve of general respiratory mortality was right on previous year patterns.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 It was just coronavirus replacing influenza and syncytial and other respiratory viruses.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 When it became available, the official definition of polio was changed, and other conditions that had been causing paralysis suddenly disappeared.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 As polio was epidemic, things like aseptic meningitis were either rising to replace the disappearing polio, in other words, the definition was the only thing that changed.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 Paralysis stayed the same, and so if you eliminated polio by saying that it didn't fit the definition of what was causing paralysis, then the vaccine could get the credit for it.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 The same thing was done in the opposite direction with cancer from the 1940s through the 1950s. They increased the definition of cancer of the breast and uterus, for example.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 Things that had been non-cancer became cancer, and so if you cure all of these cases of non-cancer, it shows that your treatment is effective.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 But if you look at the actual death from cancer, the deaths from cancer increased exactly at the speed that the treatment for cancer increased.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 By definition, they were having a tremendous success in curing cancer by creating a strawman of disease and curing it, but meanwhile, the bystander patient was dying at a higher rate.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 I think that accounts for why the coronavirus deaths are tending to displace flu virus deaths.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 I have a question in regards to the coronavirus. If the Chinese are aware that this has been dropped at their doorstep as a warning, they must have done some testing internally and probably confirmed that this is not nearly as dangerous as what we hear on TV.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Do you think they took the bait, so to speak, and quarantined the entire country? Was it sort of an exercise in their own police state for future purposes, or were they really concerned that maybe this could have unforeseen lethality later down the road?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 As far as I can tell, it could be either of those equally.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Okay. All right.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 What do you make of the flip-flopping of the WHO saying, or another organization saying, "Oh, masks don't help. You don't need to wear them. Oh, you must wear a mask," and now it's basically illegal to not wear a mask?

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 How could that happen? Were they just not coordinated to the story, the narrative on the public?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 Yeah. They didn't plan it all out with that meeting that came up with Event 201. They left some details that were sloppy.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 Can you talk a little bit more about Event 201 and then also this lockstep scenario narratives from the Rockefeller Foundation? And then also, sorry to throw so much at you, but Harry Vox really predicting – once you know the plan, it's kind of easy to predict, but Harry Vox's scarily accurate prediction where he just – he kind of calls all of this in 2014.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 But Event 201, lockstep, and these kind of "scenarios" that they run, what are they for? Why are they doing these things?

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 Why are they doing which things? I mean, why are they doing it right now?

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Well, so the lockstep document I think came out in 2010, but I would imagine most of the public is not familiar with this Rockefeller Foundation document and things like 201.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 But they seem to see these things out in the public, and then when you bring them up, that they're identical to what we're experiencing now, you're called a conspiracy theorist.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 So I mean when you read something like this, what is your take on it?

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Oh, that they really were planning this. I think Harry Vox is right. You can't imagine them as being more evil than they really are.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 We're always short in our estimation of how bad they are.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 I have a more sinister explanation why they're doing this, why they're seeding the public with these things.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 I mean, now that everything is being monitored online, it's sort of – they probably have a list, and I'm sure they have a list of people who are kind of reading between the lines and realizing what's really going on.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 It's very similar to the leaders of the Occupy Wall Street movement. If you remember, they had snipers that were ready to take them out.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 I'm not saying there are snipers for all of us waiting on the roof, but I think I would guarantee you that we are all on some kind of a list if we fit the profile of people who are essentially reading these documents and realizing what's going on.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 Because the vast majority of people that are around me that I've mentioned these things to, they're so out of it that basically you can't even talk about these topics without being considered a nut.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 At the same time, I'm pretty sure that there's probably an agency somewhere keeping track of who is saying what online and who can become a potential leader of a resistance movement.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Yeah, I think doing everything possible on the internet and telephones and so on is important, but besides that, people have to start actually getting in touch personally and passing messages personally,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 organizing on the ground level, literally, and establishing networks within the system and hoping to find contacts within the surveillance structure.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 Like my experience in the past, just with trying to go abroad to teach, that involves surveillance to the extent that one of my old friends who turned out to be sort of my overseer for some government agency,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 he said he would tell me when we retired, but he died before retiring.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 But his wife confirmed that he was in surveillance.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 But every time I would have an idea, like to go to teach in Nicaragua or Salvador or something, he would somehow locate my location, even though I hadn't kept in touch with him and didn't have a telephone.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 But he would somehow find my address and get in touch and ask what I was doing and then say, "Don't do it."

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 You have direct experience with this?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 Yeah. I was never aware of it happening, except when someone like that would intervene.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 He was one of the other union people from the Northwest. We knew him as a fanatical anti-marijuana person because he knew that that would be used to damage the union workers if he was tainted by marijuana.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 But the night before he was to fly to San Salvador with the other union guys, his apartment was arrested, marijuana was planted, and he was put in jail to miss his flight.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 As far as I knew, he didn't know why it happened. He wasn't prosecuted. Charges were dropped.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 But the guys that went there were sitting in a restaurant starting to get organized, and the army murdered them all.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 So my view was that he had his friend somewhere in the government that protected him by having him framed.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 Are you familiar with the writings and the interviews of this lady called Kay Griggs?

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 I didn't hear exactly what you said.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 There is this lady, her name is Kay Griggs, and she has been posting interviews about the power structure within the government and all the conspiracies.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 And she verbatim said pretty much what you just did was done to her.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 She was married to a very high-level former NATO official. He was in charge of, I forgot what it was, some kind of a policy for NATO.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 So he was the second or third in command at the NATO headquarters in Europe, and she was married to him for about 20 to 30 years.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 And he was basically, his job, he was basically an assassin, and he was either killing people or helping kill people who were subverting the empire.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 And apparently after she started speaking about these things, he promptly divorced her. He disappeared.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 If you try to look for his name, he cannot be found online.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 But more importantly, she said that people would randomly break into apartments or hotels where she would go out and stay there.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 And basically this would be a message of saying, be mindful of what you're saying because we can frame you in any way we want.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 And if we don't like what you're saying, maybe something much worse would happen.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 Yeah, I'm being nearsighted and generally tending to be absent-minded and such.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 I never would notice things, but whenever this guy who was my surveillance person was with me,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 like I would come back to the school, put my key in the lock, and pull it out and find shreds of paraffin on it.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 I said, "What was that?" And he said, "Oh, sometimes they do that to make a copy of your key so they can break in."

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 By the way, it was me. Don't worry about it.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 Other times I wasn't noticing someone being like a clown surveillance person who was doing a show of being sneaky but looking ridiculous,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 hiding behind a skinny light post, for example.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 I wouldn't have noticed it except my friend pointed it out.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 And then the guy wrote a number in the dust of my windshield and then it disappeared.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 I said, "I wonder why he wrote that number."

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 And my friend said, "That looks like an immigration tourist card number."

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 So I pulled out my tourist card and it was my immigration number that this guy had written.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 But I wouldn't have noticed it if the surveillance guy hadn't pointed it out to me.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 So maybe that's what protected you. You were so absent-minded. Their signs weren't working.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 I think part of his instruction at that point was to try to get me to leave the country.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Okay. So that was Nicaragua, you said? Or El Salvador?

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 What was that?

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 Was that in Nicaragua or El Salvador?

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 No, that was Mexico.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 Mexico. Okay.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 Can we talk a little bit about Bill Gates' role in this?

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 And this Politico article says, "Meet the world's most powerful doctor, Bill Gates."

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 And so I also – somebody called him a pandemic hobbyist, which I thought was funny.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 But what is your take?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 I don't imagine that very, very, very powerful people give as many interviews as Bill Gates.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 So what do you think he's an extension of, Ray?

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Oh, he likes to hobnob with the very top bankers, the Rockefellers and Rothschild type.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 And I think he's in the network, CIA, IBM, creating his business and his billions.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 And he's right from the start knowing somewhat what the scheme is.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 But he's sort of a microcephalic type who follows orders but doesn't do much else.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 It's funny because my dad worked for IBM, and he worked in for computers my entire life.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 And all I heard when I was growing up was, "What a son of a bitch Bill Gates was."

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 And so it's kind of funny to me that he's reformed his image so much as being this Christ-like savior with the vaccines.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 And it reminded me of John D. Rockefeller because apparently he was hated by everybody.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 And then he had like a campaign to reform his image, I think.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 Yeah, and public health. He got poor people to wear shoes in the South and did lots of good things.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 I always thought that a powerful doctor is a contradiction of terms, but apparently I'm the only one who thinks that way.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 I tried to bring it up to a few doctor friends of mine, and they said, "No, it's perfectly fine."

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 I said, "Well, a powerful doctor to me would mean somebody who cured cancer."

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 And they said, "No, no, no. You're living in a fantasy world.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 A powerful doctor means who has the potential of one day being either the president or running global health."

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 Which seems exactly what Bill Gates seems to be aiming towards.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 Yeah. And the world economy is part of world health.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 You want to keep people just sick enough that they have to consume the drugs and be under the control of the doctors and the drug companies.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 Do you think they've gotten the science down, you know, improved enough to the point where they can say,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 "On average, we can control how long a person lives and exactly when they die, when their worth to the system essentially is exhausted."

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 Basically, they reach either a level of age or a level of sickness where they're no longer worth to the system to continue maintaining them.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 So more or less on an average level, they can engineer the death of the average citizen.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 Yeah. And when someone is in the hands of a healthcare system where the military or the insurance company or the healthcare corporation,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 where they're responsible for their final sickness, it's well established that the final sickness is the most economical disposition.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 Morphine is the standard treatment for cancer even though it's recognized for at least 100 years that it makes cancer grow faster.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 But it's a very cheap way to finish them off and save money.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 Going back to what you talked about Bill Gates kind of being born into this hobnobbing with the elites and in an old interview with Bill Moyers,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 Bill Gates says his dad was head of Planned Parenthood.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 And so I know people have a knee-jerk reaction to that, but I feel like it's fairly well talked about,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 like Margaret Sanger and that being kind of a racist depopulation strategy.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 And then Bill Gates' dad is head of that Planned Parenthood and Bill Gates' dad being associated with Rockefeller.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 Oh yeah, they talk about that, the efficient population and the things that will not prolong poverty,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 get rid of the people who are occupying the land that needs to be made efficient.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 And then a picture surfaced with Anthony Fauci with William H. Gates, David Rockefeller, Soros and just the elite of the elite.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 And so again I'm not sure how many people have seen these types of pictures, but they're just interesting, the connections between these people.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 Yeah, Fauci is another person that follows orders and administers punishment and knows how to very efficiently, bluntly and crudely make things look right on the surface.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 While stealing people's ideas and blocking their research.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 And do you have any idea why, again, just the relationship of Trump and this clique of people, like why, like Trump seems semi-skeptical of what was happening.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 Why do you think he was letting Fauci kind of run the show?

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 I think it was actual indecision, not being a complete insider.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 I have a question about the general economy. Let's say things now reopen, because that's, Trump wants this to happen in order to get re-elected for lack of a better reason.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 How do you foresee things continuing? I mean, do you think that, because it seems to me that the industry, the massive industry that generates profits for all the bankers and the elite, has gotten to the point where it cannot really produce profit on its own.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 It needs government money. That's really where most of the profit comes from. They're literally being handed money out.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 This cannot really be sustainable. I mean, at some point, even the dumbest member of the public will say, well, hold on a second.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 We've already experienced two once in a generation recessions/depressions.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 We have an entire generation calling them the millennials who have no concept of ever owning a house or retiring or having a vacation longer than a week.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 Even the regular people in the street are probably going to start to question this mode of operating where a crisis is manufactured now every, less than every 10 years.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 Do you think this will be like the last such event before it collapses?

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 If they can keep their attention on curing a mythical virus, I think they're keeping people under control.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 But they have their different layers of control ready.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 If one doesn't work, they have the other. The money went right into the big corporations that failed to put it to use employing people.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 It created some temporary jobs, but most of the money didn't really get to the people.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 As they realize that, maybe they'll send out another wave of money if it's needed. But if people start going into the streets demanding change, then they have their other levels of responding.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 If we hit unemployment levels of 50 million people, you can't bail all of these people out.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 They're not willing. They're sending $1,200 checks as a one-time thing.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 At some point, these people will need to eat.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 If you're not willing to create a system of universal basic income, which it seems they're not willing currently, these people have to do something.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 If the economy is destroyed and all of these large corporations need money but not really employees, you have to do something with those 50 million people.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 I think this epidemic has given them an acceleration of what they were planning.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 They'll let up on it to relieve revolutionary pressure if needed, but will be ready with something else, terrorism or something different to get people's attention.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 Right.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 That process started in 1980 with the working and middle class failing to share in the increased productivity.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 But in these 40 years, how many people have caught on to the fact that everything is getting worse steadily for a whole generation?

00:46:51.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 It's very slow to – the implications are being deflected by the daily news.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 Public schools, colleges and the mass media are constantly telling people that they're still in the middle class.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:22.340
 Ray, have you been privy to any of the ProDoctor propaganda? Like, if I scroll through that

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:30.340
 application Instagram, which is very popular, it's many different videos of doctors dancing

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:35.920
 and status having signs put together saying stay home. And there seems to be a concentrated

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:44.600
 effort to promote doctors. And then James Corbett put together that he said similar to the veterans

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:50.840
 of 9/11, the new heroes doctors will be to push an agenda, presumably so you don't fight

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:54.680
 back when you're given your many, many vaccines.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:48:09.720
 Yeah, it's all part of total subservience. 50 years ago, I was saying that it won't be

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:19.160
 long until they keep people on the assembly line by installing a screw in their skull

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:25.560
 and attaching it to a trolley. So they can only go from the bathroom to the lunchroom

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:33.880
 to the assembly line and then home. But with the telephones, they don't need the trolley

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.480
 wire.

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:40.080
 I think the social distancing right now has a I mean, I suspect it has a more more sinister

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:45.520
 role as well. They're preventing the you know, people from organizing right? If there's a

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:49.840
 sufficient number of people who are willing to not take up in arms, but at least start

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:55.960
 an organization like Occupy Wall Street, by telling them stay home and by mandating it

00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:00.920
 for them to stay home. It's an effective means of control because you can only achieve so

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.920
 much over a phone or computer.

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:07.800
 Yeah, and that way they don't waste their pepper spray.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:16.640
 Ray, did you anticipate this being the kind of I don't know what the right word is the

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:25.760
 the like a medical problem or a pandemic health problem being the I mean, I can't think of

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:32.600
 the word the initiation for the catalyst for the change like into the type of new world

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:38.560
 or a new world order situation is this kind of part of why you do what you do, because

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.160
 it all kind of makes sense now, given how this thing is playing out.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:53.360
 Yeah, the health thing has always been my sense of a point of reality, where you might

00:49:53.360 --> 00:50:03.280
 be able to if you can't show anyone what's happening politically, militarily, in the

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:13.880
 outside world, you maybe can get their attention on the fact that it's affecting their health,

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:23.000
 and you can get them to contact whatever reality they have the potential for and maybe work

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:34.640
 from there. And I found that the progressive people were totally out of contact with that

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:43.640
 sort of reality. But the far right, I found people coming to my lectures, it was only

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:54.720
 the extreme right that was interested in health and survival. And the same people who were

00:50:54.720 --> 00:51:03.600
 saying that, that the communists were putting fluoride in the water. You can open that up

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:12.840
 and get them to realize that the corporations and the doctors are doing the equivalent of

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:18.920
 putting fluoride, polluting their vital bodily fluids.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:28.920
 Well, speaking of that, an article in 2014 said, "The WHO campaign is not about a mass

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:36.880
 sterilization exercise. Kenyan doctors find anti-fertility agent in UN tetanus vaccine."

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:42.800
 And I guess this vaccine was laced with HCG. So, you, given your understanding of endocrinology

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:47.800
 is that the type of thing that's... I know there's aluminum and mercury and the adjuvants

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:54.760
 are really harmful, but do you think the underlining idea behind vaccination is sterilization?

00:51:54.760 --> 00:52:07.800
 Well, they found HCG in some of the African vaccines. And it's known that that will sterilize

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:21.200
 you at least for a few years. And that was designed, you know, the CIA doesn't announce

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:30.680
 that they're doing it or going to do it, but they plan for its possibility. And then someone

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:37.360
 always figures out how to sneak it out into the world.

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:43.880
 But you might've answered it, but like, I guess, do you think the, like why Gates et

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:50.680
 al is so kind of determined to give people vaccines, is that just to make them sicker?

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:56.480
 Or do you think there's a specific like kind of nefarious purpose? Like they will add something

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.280
 that will be anti-fertility?

00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:09.640
 Oh yeah. I think his background in population control is right there on the surface.

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:16.640
 Well, it's hilarious that like the elite have several things in common, but one is we must

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:22.920
 depopulate. And then at the same time, Bill Gates and others are saying to take this vaccine

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:37.160
 so we can save your lives. It doesn't even register in just a basic way. It's very odd.

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:47.680
 The idea of preventing epidemics by like the old 120 year ago Rockefeller idea of giving

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:59.760
 people shoes and food and curing endemic disease that way, that's now too expensive. Vaccines

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:15.920
 are a matter of economy. The known effects of vitamin A and vitamin D just making massive

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:22.560
 improvements in disease resistance of all sorts. That's more expensive, as cheap as

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:35.440
 those are, it's more expensive than a vaccine, not even counting the depopulation effects.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.960
 I don't know if you see that, that sort of article. I mean, I'm sure that's the one you're

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:44.120
 referring to, the Kenyan one. It only talks about vaccinating the girls and HCG has a

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:50.600
 known anti-fertility effect in girls, but apparently it works also in boys. And I found

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:57.000
 about this in a little bit of a roundabout way. Apparently if a male buys a pregnancy

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:02.660
 test in the pharmacy and pees on it and it comes back positive, that is a biomarker for

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:08.520
 testicular cancer. Apparently the levels of HCG are elevated in males with testicular

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:15.760
 cancer. Conversely, there's some serious research suggesting that if a male chronically uses

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:21.680
 a specific amount of HCG, they may give themselves testicular cancer, sort of like a permanent

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:27.800
 infertility agent, which goes way beyond what it can do in girls.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:38.840
 Yeah, it's dangerous stuff. I've been warning people not to use it as a diet weight loss

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:45.960
 method because of that effect on estrogen and cancer.

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:51.880
 Are its effects similar to the human growth hormone, the one that people also inject with?

00:55:51.880 --> 00:56:02.680
 No, not exactly, but yeah, that one has its age-promoting effect, thickening the basement

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:14.200
 membranes and so imitating age changes. But the chorionic gonadotropin increases estrogen

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:23.720
 production and estrogen is produced by any type of cell in the body. So you don't want

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:31.240
 to have untimely stimulation of estrogen.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:35.940
 It's so ironic that most of the Hollywood elite are injecting with HGH specifically

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:40.880
 for anti-aging purposes. I guess that's why they look so horrible when you see them on

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.880
 TV.

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:48.440
 Well, Ray, Georgi and I were talking yesterday about, I'm looking at a picture of John D.

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:56.640
 Rockefeller and this Zbigniew Brzezinski, Soros. Why do you think these people personify or

00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:03.200
 they aesthetically look evil? Have you ever thought about that? John D. Rockefeller is

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:08.720
 one of, I'm not saying this to be mean, but he's objectively really disturbing looking.

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.720
 Why do you think that is?

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:23.480
 Yeah, the old women in that picture with the Rockefellers and other giants of civilization,

00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:33.240
 they all look like, Hollywood couldn't design evil characters as well as that.

00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:41.680
 Well, I was looking up some of these people and who was it? Maybe it was Irene Diamond.

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:47.620
 I think she might have been involved in AIDS research and things. Then somebody mentioned

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:53.200
 on Twitter somewhere that this whole thing is really similar to AIDS. I was too young

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:57.960
 to have gone through that, but do you recall similarities? I'm looking at a magazine cover

00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:04.920
 right now from life in July 1985 when I was born and it says, "Now no one is safe from

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:12.200
 AIDS." It has a picture of a young boy, a family, and some evil military person.

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:22.680
 No, I don't think there's much similarity except that they both damage your immunity

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:31.200
 and make you sick. Did I ever tell you the story of the guy from Fort Detrick that told

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:45.480
 me about the AIDS research 11, 12 years before AIDS broke out? In 1969, this guy came to

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:53.760
 one of my free university classes and hung around afterwards and wanted to talk to me

00:58:53.760 --> 00:59:02.040
 as a biology graduate student, someone that might take him seriously. I didn't even take

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:08.680
 him seriously enough to get his name and contact information, but he said he had quit his job

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:19.080
 at Fort Detrick because the people were seriously designing a virus that would be racially selective

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:30.600
 to kill black people specifically. At that time, nothing had been published on ethnic

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:40.040
 magnetic tags that a virus could attach to, but two or three years later, the first papers

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:46.040
 were published coming out of Fort Detrick, exactly what he had said but without the purpose

00:59:46.040 --> 01:00:02.200
 defined. My molecular biology professors honored those as great progress in science.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.660
 Do you think the plan changed at some point from creating a virus to kill black and gay

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:12.840
 people to doing something different, like the dysgenics kind of thing of poisoning everybody

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:16.520
 and just making everybody basically have brain damage?

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:31.520
 Yeah, the plan is constantly developing. It wasn't perfected at an early date. It develops.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:37.480
 And you think like the Rand Corporation and Tavistock and all these think tanks, they

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:45.560
 are making the plans for the elites and then they're being kind of put into place and

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.400
 we're the recipients.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:58.360
 Yeah, the universities are working out the details often without knowing it. I think

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:06.880
 my molecular biology professors were just jerks, but they were playing right into the

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.880
 whole scheme.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:14.720
 Well, they depend on government money like almost every other academic these days, right?

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.400
 Yeah.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:21.800
 So I have a question about these viruses that are being engineered to harm the world. You

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.040
 will think that the people who create the poison would want to have the antidote for

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:32.640
 themselves. Do you think there is something behind the scenes that the elite possesses

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.840
 to protect itself? Or do you think the science is simply so pathological that they can create

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.760
 the poison but they can't create the remedy?

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.480
 They probably know about vitamin D.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:51.720
 Oh, GcMAF, right? That's what came up a few times in terms of treatment.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.920
 Which was that?

01:01:53.920 --> 01:02:01.040
 GCMAF. Apparently it's like a receptor that's activated by vitamin D.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.840
 GcMAF?

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:17.360
 The idea of damaging the brain, the mass vaccination I think is objectively having that effect.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:26.720
 I looked at brain size in relation to body size trends over the decades. And right when

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:38.880
 massive child vaccination expanded in the U.S., that was the first decade that the brain

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:48.120
 didn't keep pace with the body growth. In several countries around the world, the brains

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:55.720
 got either got smaller or didn't enlarge while the body did enlarge. So the brain-body

01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:03.680
 ratio has shrunk, but starting with the decade of the '80s.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:08.720
 And I'm sure you've seen the studies showing that the IQ, the average worldwide IQ, after

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:14.600
 enjoying a century of rising, suddenly started dropping around the late '60s and at this

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:19.760
 point is 30% lower than what it was in the '70s.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:26.200
 Yeah. But even the mass of the brain is now shrinking.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.080
 Wow.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:35.200
 I was perusing a PDF called like philanthropic influence and the global health agenda. And

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:40.400
 it was like, who sets the agenda talking about the Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:47.080
 And they said, "The Gates Foundation prioritization of the vaccine solution for multiple health

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:51.160
 problems reflects the foundation's preference for interventions with quick, measurable,

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:56.400
 and visible solutions. One of GAVI's," and that's an acronym for something, "Senior

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.800
 Representatives reported that Bill Gates often told him in private conversations that he

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.480
 is vehemently against health systems. He basically said it was a complete waste of money and

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:11.200
 that there was no evidence that it works. So I will not see a dollar or cent of my money

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:17.880
 to go to strengthening of health systems." And so I'm not pro health, I mean, doctors

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:25.680
 or anything, but doesn't that just speak volumes that they think vaccines and not cleaning

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:31.520
 up, like not cleaning up poverty or like you said, giving supplements of basic things like

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:37.680
 vitamin D and A, and they have to go with these experimental vaccines with massive conflicts

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.480
 of interest. It just seems totally insane.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:59.600
 Yeah. I'm against medicine in general. So Medicare for everyone would be a sort of an

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:05.800
 ideological thing, but it would make many things worse.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:10.960
 Well, Ivan Illich, "Preservation of the sick life of medically dependent people in an unhealthy

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:17.440
 environment is the principal business of the medical profession." Pretty much nails it.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.880
 Yeah.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:25.120
 So indirectly and probably without knowing the far right are actually protecting the

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:31.200
 population by being so heavily against any kind of a universal healthcare system.

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:42.920
 Yeah. My experience, the people who attend my lectures over the last 50 years, the people

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:53.720
 with the superficial ideology that's called far right, they very often have contact with

01:05:53.720 --> 01:06:07.200
 reality and life. They're actually more pro-life than the so-called left who say they are pro-life.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:20.000
 I think it might be a fairly easy thing to overcome that verbal identification of ideology

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:30.600
 right and left and get people to pay attention to what it is to be an organism. Organisms

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:42.200
 are naturally tending towards altruism and empathy. That's a biological thing that so-called

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:55.880
 right-wingers are not impaired at as people, only as ideologues. So if there's a way that

01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:05.280
 they can reattach themselves to the world, they've already got sort of a body commitment

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.880
 to not being fascist.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:15.160
 Wow. That's amazing. So how do you reconcile that with their idea? Because most far right

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:21.360
 people are very heavily pro-death penalty, pro-gun rights, pro-somebody walks on you

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:27.160
 alone, you're allowed to shoot them kind of thing. Or are you saying that the people that

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:31.840
 you think are more in contact with reality are even further right towards the libertarian/anarchist

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:36.120
 side, that they don't even believe in government and terror and whatnot. They just want to

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.120
 be left alone.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:52.040
 Yeah, the people that identify as libertarian are among the most gullible. I've known lots

01:07:52.040 --> 01:08:02.920
 of them and the ones that have studied it and make an ideology of it, things like death

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:28.040
 penalty combined with libertarianism. I think there's an old-fashioned kind of conservative.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:33.560
 You know who Ron Unz is? Or Unz, U-N-Z?

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:38.160
 Is that the unz.com? Yeah, unz reports or something?

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:49.080
 Yeah. He has identified himself, he was a publisher of American Conservative and has

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:56.280
 been identified as a right-wing extremist. But some of his publications are much more

01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:04.040
 progressive than things you see in Counterpunch, for example.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:09.200
 I think Whitney Webb started writing for the Unz Review not long ago, and she's somebody

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:17.800
 that went deep on Epstein and all his connections. Speaking of Epstein, Bill Gates is, according

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:23.280
 to the New York Times, Bill Gates met with Jeffrey Epstein many times despite his past.

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:30.640
 So Jeffrey Epstein is this convicted pedophile, child trafficker, and then Bill Gates continues

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:37.080
 to meet with him. What do you make of that, Ray?

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:52.080
 The worship of power. Epstein flaunted his connections with power. He knew everyone powerful,

01:09:52.080 --> 01:10:07.080
 and that attracted Bill Gates, wanting to associate himself with power wherever it was.

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:27.880
 I think the CIA has tried to infiltrate itself into every conceivable cultish movement. Probably

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:40.920
 the pedophiles are being manipulated by the CIA as much as the religious groups and political

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:44.240
 groups.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:52.000
 I was listening to Whitney Webb calling Maria Farmer, who had worked for Epstein on his

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.520
 island and she wasn't allowed to leave. She said some ridiculous stuff, like she would

01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:05.760
 see five young girls per day visiting Epstein. But if you try to find out what Epstein actually

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:14.080
 did, it's actually difficult. I don't know what he was charged with, but it's not even

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:20.640
 close in the realm of what Maria Farmer is talking about. She knew Ghislaine Maxwell

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:27.640
 and Epstein pretty well. Then she was talking about what happened to all these people, and

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.600
 it just getting very dark pretty quickly.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:38.320
 But anyways, Whitney Webb said that Epstein was into eugenics too. So again, just another

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:46.920
 point for all these eugenics crazy elite people.

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:53.320
 I think Ghislaine Maxwell is pretty obviously an Israeli intelligence asset. She's either

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:58.280
 like her father, like father, like daughter, I guess. I mean, I think it's pretty obvious

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:03.440
 her job was probably to collect compromising information on all of the pedophiles that

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:08.840
 were visiting the ranch. I wouldn't be surprised if they have a video on most of the powerful

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:13.080
 people in the world right now doing something nefarious, and that's how they get what they

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.800
 want from them.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:23.640
 But after Epstein was arrested, there was a little bit of news about the nature of the

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:31.720
 photographs they found in his house and safe. But after he was killed, nothing more has

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.720
 come out.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:38.560
 Do you think they'll ever reopen the investigation? Do you think people have forgotten the social

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:43.760
 memories is way too short? And now everybody's attention is now on to the virus and nobody

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.520
 cares about Epstein anymore.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:59.400
 Yeah, yeah. Events like that erase the immediate past and let us move on.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:07.800
 What do you make of Trump's connections with Epstein?

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:24.840
 He didn't seem to be as close as Bill Gates or Bill Clinton. Clinton and the lawyer, Harvard

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.840
 lawyer professor.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:26.840
 Dershowitz?

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:35.520
 Dershowitz, yeah. They had many more contacts than Trump.

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:40.440
 Dershowitz, isn't this the Harvard lawyer who wrote a couple of op-eds saying that torture

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:45.280
 should be legal? Or am I thinking of somebody else?

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.000
 What should be legal?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.040
 There was a famous Harvard lawyer who wrote a couple of op-eds.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:57.320
 Yeah, he did.

01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:02.640
 Stepping back a bit, just because I like to talk about it, but the Trilateral Commission

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:11.000
 and this being, I think the thing is that Brzezinski wrote Between Two Ages and then

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.320
 Rockefeller saw that book and then he created the Trilateral Commission. Do you see that

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:20.600
 as, if people are trying to trace back where we're at today, do you see the Trilateral

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:26.200
 Commission as something important to investigate?

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:39.840
 Not especially. I think the Birch Society was pretty well investigating it. The people

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:54.520
 on the far right of press were giving a good picture of what his plans were.

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:59.560
 I think the only thing I'd like to pose this question to you, Ray, which is worse, the

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:03.840
 possibility of getting a virus that could kill you, especially if you have comorbidities,

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.480
 or have your life savings wiped out, your home foreclosed, your car repossessed, your

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:13.160
 kid's college dreams being crushed, maybe that's okay, and living on welfare? What do

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:19.720
 you think is worse to you?

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:26.240
 I always would prefer the disease.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.080
 Because it's usually less severe, especially if you're not visiting a doctor, right?

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:43.400
 Yeah, I don't believe the disease is especially harmful, so not much conflict between.

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.800
 I know you've talked about it in multiple interviews, but can we talk about transmission

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:54.920
 of disease? Is the transmission of viruses between people just kind of an inherent property

01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:02.640
 of human communication? What do you make of that? The idea of social distancing in general,

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.920
 like if I go outside and I have coronavirus, I'm going to kill grandma. What do you make

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:10.320
 of that?

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:20.720
 The mechanism by which it reproduces itself, it goes in and activates the enzymes that

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:31.480
 copy the RNA and make the proteins that form the capsule, and then fast numbers pour out

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:41.560
 through the endoplasmic reticulum and are secreted. That mechanism is already making

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:52.240
 retrovirus particles that, under a microscope and by chemical analysis, are structural,

01:16:52.240 --> 01:17:03.360
 close analogs of the various virus particles. They only began to be really studied at the

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:13.880
 beginning of this century, the exosomes, microvesicles, and various names for them. But the serum

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:25.920
 and the lymph are really full. Under an ordinary microscope, they're basically invisible dust

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:33.160
 in the background, but when you look at that dust under a microscope, they are these highly

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:45.600
 organized vesicles with a structured cytoplasm-like cover and RNA, DNA, enzymes, lipids, and so

01:17:45.600 --> 01:18:00.400
 on. The fact that maybe half of our DNA collection consists of things that structurally look

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:11.640
 like retroviral copied DNA and that when we're under stress, we pour out large quantities

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:19.600
 of these exosomes that are thought to be a communication between different tissues, like

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:27.480
 an injured lung will send exosomes that are absorbed by bone marrow cells, which then

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:37.320
 make particular kind of white blood cells that have the capacity to repair the lung.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:48.320
 So they're known to have communication property in the organism. They are abundantly present

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:56.600
 in maternal milk and are taken up through the intestine wall as immune support for the

01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:07.040
 baby and they are known to be able to enter the gonads in a way that would make them candidates

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:15.800
 for what Darwin called gemmules. He thought they accounted for the inheritance of acquired

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:27.240
 properties. The developing organ influenced by the environment would accumulate its properties

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:36.280
 and send them to the gonads for reproductive copying.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:46.640
 In bacteria, starting with the simplest organism, bacteria can make particles like this, which

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:59.720
 they transmit through a tube to other bacteria that lack the resistance factor, for example,

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:10.760
 for antibiotics. But bacteria have been using this before antibiotics were thought of. It's

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:18.760
 a communication, a genetic interchange between species and individuals of the same species

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:31.120
 or across very different bacterial types to share acquired information. Since we can use

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:42.520
 it within the organism, I think individuals probably habitually share stuff like this.

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:55.840
 For example, you can find the DNA from a woman's previous partners in her tissues. All of her

01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:10.120
 tissues can be penetrated by the DNA she has been exposed to through semen. I think that

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:17.640
 since the gonads are known to be able to take up these exosomes, the semen will probably

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:29.440
 be found to contain lots of these exosomes, which look like and are structured like viruses.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:37.280
 If bacteria can do it, I think it's probably a routine thing for other organisms. Their

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:44.240
 existence hadn't been suspected by Western science until just about the beginning of

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:54.760
 this century. Even though people were writing about the apparent cross-phylum transmission

01:21:54.760 --> 01:22:07.880
 of genes 50 or 60 years ago, it wasn't acceptable to talk about it. But now I think the way

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:14.520
 viruses came into being, when I talked to my professors about it, they just didn't want

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:22.840
 to talk about it because they have to evolve in organisms and what that means they didn't

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:34.040
 want to consider. But since we now know that exosomes are repair material and cross individual

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:44.880
 communication, at least in bacteria, probably it's involved in that adoption of DNA from

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:57.760
 semen. It's probably something happening all the time that we take up exosomes. I think

01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:09.400
 when an animal is very sick, it's known that the exosomes participate in amplifying the

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:18.240
 sickness instead of correcting the sickness. The serum from an old animal accelerates aging

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:28.360
 of a young animal and young serum retards aging of an old animal. It's probably the

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:37.640
 presence or absence of harmful exosomes that accounts for that property of serum. I think

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:48.000
 it's reasonable that sometimes these exosomes of stressed individuals become toxic enough

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.080
 that that would account for where viruses came from.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:58.520
 I have a question and actually just a restatement and a question. Do you think it's fair to

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:03.320
 say that viruses are basically a very efficient way of horizontal gene transfer that will

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:04.920
 be one of their primary purposes?

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:07.640
 Of doing what?

01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:13.640
 Of viruses being one of their primary purposes in nature would be to enable horizontal gene

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:15.800
 transfer across organisms.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:27.240
 Right. Within organisms that's established, but I think organisms other than bacteria

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.760
 are doing it.

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:37.080
 Then I guess my question which is related to the first one is, if their purpose is also

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:42.960
 as a communication mechanism across organisms, would it make sense to say that let's say

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.640
 if an organism is very stressed and producing a lot of these viruses, that would be a signal

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:53.680
 to the organisms surrounding it that the environment is suboptimal so that those organisms can

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:56.760
 mount a defensive response, so to speak?

01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:06.600
 Right, just like bacteria. When you're healthy, like 80% of the people who contract coronavirus

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:16.120
 don't even notice it. I think they're potentially constructive assistance improving our immune

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.120
 system.

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:25.000
 Okay. I've seen a few fascinating articles. Many of them are from the '60s and '70s before

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.200
 really the medical authorities clamped down and controlled the information fully. There

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:35.040
 are some older studies showing that nurses working in specific wards at the hospital

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:40.320
 tend to come down and sometimes even die with the exact same diseases of the people that

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:47.320
 they're taking care of. Do you think that may be explainable by this communication mechanism?

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:52.920
 If a nurse is taking care of only cancer patients, they emit something, whether it's a virus

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:58.560
 or some other chemical messenger, that eventually makes the organism of that healthy person

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:04.480
 also succumb. It's known that being around sick people is not a good thing, and conversely,

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.240
 being around healthy young people is beneficial for health.

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:14.080
 Yeah, that's been known since ancient China times.

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.600
 So do you think viruses could be one of those mechanisms? Like a very sick person would

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:23.040
 emit these viruses, and initially the nurse taking care of the person, her organism or

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:28.120
 his organism would be sort of warned, but if the environment is suboptimal, eventually

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:34.480
 that becomes pathological, being around these people who emit warning signals all the time.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:43.760
 Yeah, that's basically my interpretation and why I don't worry about this particular type

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:46.240
 of respiratory infection.

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.880
 Do you surround yourselves with healthy young people, Ray?

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:56.320
 I don't know. I would if I did.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.600
 Do you still teach at the University of Oregon?

01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:03.120
 Oh no, not for many, many years.

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.960
 Because you mentioned you were giving some free courses, and I was wondering, how did

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:11.520
 the university allow you to provide a free course? That's socialism.

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:24.160
 In that 1968 revolution of the students, they temporarily got student-initiated courses.

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:31.960
 If you could get a professor in the department to authorize it, you could find your own teacher

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:47.000
 to teach the course, and students that I knew invited me to teach courses in biology, psychology,

01:27:47.000 --> 01:28:01.920
 anthropology, nutrition, and even one in philosophy. That was permitted for about 15 years, I think.

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.640
 And then they shut it down.

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:10.560
 Any particular reason why you don't teach anymore?

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:19.960
 Well, I used to regularly lecture in places like health food stores, would sponsor my

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:35.560
 lectures, and I would line up a row down the coast so I could drive between sites. On one

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:46.440
 trip, I had contacted someone about publishing my books, who was a distributor to the health

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:56.360
 food industry, and they saw what I was saying about unsaturated fats. And on that trip,

01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:05.360
 all of my scheduled lectures were canceled without explanation. At the health food store

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:17.440
 in San Diego, which had a regular deal with a church auditorium for their weekly lectures,

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:23.960
 the guy who was in charge of the lectures was fired and unavailable when I got there,

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:31.360
 and the people in charge didn't know that I had been scheduled. But all along the way,

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:40.160
 there were these mysterious cancellations. So that was the last time I went on my lecture

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:41.160
 trips.

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:47.840
 Do you think at this point, academia has become so authoritarian, there's basically no point

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:52.360
 bothering trying to do anything with them?

01:29:52.360 --> 01:30:01.560
 When someone went to the dean of the graduate school and wanted me to teach a course on

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:08.920
 cell water, the dean said, "But there's no literature on it. You would just be making

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:12.600
 it up."

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:18.120
 One of my old professors recently got fired for trying to invite Duesberg for speaking

01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:23.280
 at Georgetown University here in DC. As soon as the dean found out, basically, that person,

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:28.120
 even though he was a tenured professor, got kicked out because it was considered that

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:35.360
 Duesberg is a quack and no respectable university would want to associate themselves with inviting

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:40.120
 that person to even speak.

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:45.960
 Not so much related to academia, but Ray, one of my favorite things reading from you

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:52.520
 was when you were having the back and forth with Mary Enig, but it might have been somebody

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:58.120
 she was working with. They were like, "The only PhD Ray has is in disinformation."

01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:05.200
 You replied something like, "Where did she learn about my PhD in misinformation? I never

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.200
 tell anyone."

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:13.360
 It cracks me up every time.

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:19.920
 I have some questions about the microbiome, if you want to switch more on a health-related

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:20.920
 topic.

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:27.080
 Remind me, 5G is something I do want to touch on, but go ahead.

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:31.960
 I was recently reading an article. It was in a popular press magazine, but basically,

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:36.600
 it looks like the story with the microbiome is very similar to the story with the essential

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:43.960
 quote-unquote fatty acids. Now, this article came out, which said that whoever told people

01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:49.800
 that the microbiome in people is obligate, that we really need it, as it turns out, there

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.320
 is no evidence for that.

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:57.200
 When the journalists started digging and interviewing other scientists, the people who were really

01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:03.360
 studying the issue said, "I don't know why medicine claims that having bacteria in your

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:09.720
 colon is a good thing. Having a microbiome in nature is by far the exception rather than

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:10.720
 the rule."

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:22.760
 Back when many people were healthy, the small intestine was known to be sterile all the

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:36.440
 way from the mouth to the cecum, was germ-free. Now, something like 80% or 90% have bacterial

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:42.520
 living way up to the duodenum.

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:48.640
 You agree with the fact that there's basically no evidence right now showing that even the

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:54.720
 colon really needs bacteria. Yes, it will probably get colonized, but in terms of its

01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:59.440
 effects on health, we're being fear-mongered here that you have to have this bacteria,

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:05.200
 otherwise we'll die, our immune system will collapse, etc. There is no evidence for that.

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:07.360
 If you look at the literature, nothing exists.

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:14.080
 Yeah, did you read Bogomolets? I don't know how you pronounce his name, but he was a follower

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:24.320
 of Metchnikoff, and he said that aging is caused by these bacteria, that the shorter

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:31.880
 the colon and the quicker the food goes through, so fewer bacteria grow the longer you live.

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:40.760
 He gave examples of parrots. Food goes in and comes right out quickly.

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:46.160
 So that may be behind the reason why some of the Hollywood elite are experimenting with

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:51.880
 total intravenous nutrition as a way of retarding aging. I don't know if you've seen the

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:56.360
 articles on that, too. They're starting to transfuse blood from young people, too, which

01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:01.040
 is probably the more sinister version of it, but they're apparently also looking at not

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:07.200
 eating but just injecting themselves with this complete diet that's supposed to be healthy

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.200
 for them.

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:17.400
 Yeah, there's a lot of information on germ-free animals, and they are very healthy for a much

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:24.160
 longer time than germ-ridden animals.

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:29.400
 Do you think this theory that we need our microbiome and we have to feed it with all

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:35.040
 of these pro- and prebiotics, do you think that's more of an example of institutional

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:40.880
 stupidity or do you think there's something more sinister here at play that's trying to

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:41.880
 keep us sick?

01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:50.560
 No, I think that's a good case for stupidity. For years, I followed the work of several

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:56.880
 well-known biologists, and for decades, I couldn't decide whether they were evil or

01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:03.840
 just stupid. But then when they died following their own advice, I decided that they were

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:07.320
 just stupid.

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:11.840
 What is that expression, "Don't attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity"?

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.840
 Right, right.

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.280
 You want to talk about 5G?

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:21.960
 What is your take on the... I mean, I don't know this for sure, but it seems like 5G towers

01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:31.080
 are going up during this time. So is 5G something needed for the technocratic slave grid, or

01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:33.080
 what is your take on it?

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:43.800
 Yeah, I think it makes the control messages faster and more powerful and unavoidable,

01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:52.520
 but at least with that stuff, we can put a screen on the wall between us and the tower

01:35:52.520 --> 01:36:00.800
 or on the roof and attach it to ground so that we have sort of a Faraday cage around

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:08.800
 us and defend ourselves if we stay indoors. Otherwise, we'll have to get tinfoil hats

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:12.920
 with a dragging wire.

01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:17.800
 You told me this a long time ago, but chicken wire can defend against the cell phone towers,

01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:24.280
 but then you have to get a finer mesh for something like 5G. Is that right?

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.720
 Right.

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:30.160
 Just because I'm sure we'll be asked, what do you think of the idea that 5G is causing

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:35.680
 the symptoms of coronavirus?

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:46.440
 Every little thing hurts. Everything that is stressing you, using up vitamin A and tending

01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:53.360
 to lower your blood sugar is making you more susceptible and tending towards an inflammatory

01:36:53.360 --> 01:37:01.760
 state and it's just that the virus adds to all of the other things you've been exposed

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:14.080
 to stressing you. The virus is one more trigger for the shift to inflammation, but endotoxin

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:22.720
 from intestinal bacteria is producing exactly the symptoms the virus does and similar to

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:34.400
 high altitude brain and lung edema, all of those stressors when you aren't adapting properly.

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:43.800
 High altitude, people who are hyperventilating at sea level, hyperventilation becomes more

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:54.120
 dangerous at high altitude and the symptoms of hypothyroid hyperventilation overlap with

01:37:54.120 --> 01:38:03.440
 endotoxin and that overlaps with coronavirus symptoms and so on. All of the diseases end

01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:16.000
 up with the same cascade of inflammatory reactions and all of the defensive pro-energy anti-inflammatory

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:29.840
 things, thyroid, vitamin D, progesterone, calcium, aspirin and losartan for example,

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:42.560
 all of these are beneficial against aging, all of the infections, cancer, heart disease,

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:50.840
 they're all working to support the system, all of the bad things are working to inflame

01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:53.000
 and deflate the system.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.880
 One thing I think we've kind of covered it, but I just want to beat the point into the

01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:05.000
 ground, but I think I have trouble and I know other people have trouble understanding the

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:10.200
 power elite or whatever you want to call them, how they think about things and something

01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:16.640
 I did pick up from Jay Dyer who's been going through each of the globalist books. They

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:20.040
 write books and they tell you what they want to do and he's just going through them and

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:25.960
 reading them and something he said that stood out to me is the scientific priest class,

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:31.620
 they think of themselves as like engineers of evolution and they think that because they

01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:35.360
 have this privileged place and these privileged bloodlines and things that they think they

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:42.240
 should steer evolution in a certain direction and so their kind of dysgenic plan to basically

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:48.080
 kill everybody or to make everybody really stupid, they see it as a good thing because

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:57.240
 they have the ability to do that so they should do that.

01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:08.320
 Yeah their image of the elite happens to overlap with stupidity. If you look at the most influential

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:18.920
 people in our culture, the meritocracy is somewhat of an idiot, idiot-cracy.

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:27.840
 Well I have some quotes from John D. Rockefeller from, Ray have you ever heard of the book

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:33.080
 Rockefeller Medicine Men by E. Richard Brown?

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:34.920
 I don't think so.

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:41.200
 It talks about how the AMA and the whole modern medical system was established by the Rockefellers,

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:46.960
 like their specialization and things like that. But it has some choice quotes by John

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:53.680
 D. and like God gave me money and he thus felt called upon to explain I believe the

01:40:53.680 --> 01:41:03.440
 power to make money is a gift from God and to be developed and to the best of our ability

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:08.440
 for good of mankind I believe it is my duty to make money and still more money and to

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:14.880
 use the money I make for the good of my fellow man according to the dictates of my conscience.

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:20.880
 And of course we know that to him I guess that meant eugenics and the science of his

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:23.760
 day to make the world a better place.

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:24.760
 Yeah.

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:29.000
 I have a question, do you think Ray, do you think most of these people, the evil ones

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:38.440
 that are driven to harm the world, do you think they're driven by sort of like an internal

01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:42.560
 disturbed psyche because of serotonin, estrogen, etc. Or do you think there's some religious

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:43.600
 reason behind it?

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:53.280
 A lot of them seem to espouse or worship or practice these weird religious cults, even

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:58.640
 though some of them are atheists, but many of them seem to be really religious and dedicated

01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.640
 to their cult.

01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:05.240
 Do you think there's a religion that specifically enables that or like an offshoot, like a perversion

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:09.200
 of a specific religion that does that or do you think it's mostly some people got in a

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:14.520
 position of power and decided that they should do it because they can do it?

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:27.520
 I think a lot of it is what Wilhelm Reich explained as the effects of childhood harm

01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:38.320
 coming into the culture and being educated by parents, like Hitler's father was a sadistic

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:41.320
 authoritarian.

01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:54.120
 The mothers and fathers both instill a kind of authoritarian stupidity, elitism, especially

01:42:54.120 --> 01:43:03.200
 in the elite, the children of the elite get a horrible dose of that kind of destructive

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:06.480
 authoritarian upbringing.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:12.400
 So maybe they got damaged in childhood and then they grew up and found a religion that

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.640
 justifies their behavior.

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:28.160
 Right, right, whether it's Satanism or child abuse, it fits a distorted personality.

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:29.160
 I've always wondered that.

01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:35.360
 Do you think these really sick people are shown something that they cannot give up or

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:41.200
 is it just like basic primal things like sex slaves and other things and power and they

01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:47.800
 don't want to give that up because it just seems so – again their psyche is so hard

01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:52.920
 to grapple with of how insane they are.

01:43:52.920 --> 01:44:05.600
 Yeah, I think if you think of the organism as having only a certain range of behaviors,

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:18.960
 the authoritarian system has its preferred ways of being stupid, violent and cruel and

01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:22.280
 self-centered.

01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:31.600
 It goes with a patterning of the endocrine system that makes the brain tend towards verbalism,

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:42.560
 rationalism, mechanistic thinking rather than an open, empirical, exploratory attitude towards

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:43.560
 everything.

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:46.880
 I have a question in regards to that.

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:51.080
 In one of your interviews you said that we have to begin and end with being an animal

01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:52.080
 into this world, right?

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:57.560
 I don't know of any animal that behaves in this twisted and capable and is behaving

01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:00.280
 in this twisted and perverted way as a human.

01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:05.060
 Do you think that's coming from the fact that humans have a wider range of possible

01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:07.320
 behaviors compared to animals?

01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:15.920
 No, I think it's the exploitive culture taking form through language, how language

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:21.920
 shapes the way you look at the world and yourself.

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:30.200
 It closes off things right from when people start thinking, they start losing their animal

01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:39.920
 intelligence to the extent that they identify with those authoritarian elements of how the

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:42.320
 cultures are set up.

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:46.760
 Do you think animals are capable of similar behaviors like humans, sort of like being

01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:50.920
 atrocious to others?

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:54.920
 Not to that extent.

01:45:54.920 --> 01:46:11.640
 They show damage by being fearful or aggressive, but nothing very close to human authoritarianism.

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:22.040
 Like a vicious dog or a fearful dog, their brain can be restored to a great extent along

01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:24.400
 with their hormones.

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:31.120
 So what is the human capacity or human faculty that allows humans to behave in an intentionally

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:35.960
 evil way and often even planning these evil things decades ahead?

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:38.480
 Is it our higher intelligence?

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:47.920
 Yeah, the big cortex that can be so taken over by language and culture.

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:53.120
 So basically with capacity for good, there is also capacity for evil.

01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:59.240
 So it's just the capacity and how you use it depends on your upbringing and the environment.

01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:08.000
 Yeah, the choice between culture and life.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:19.200
 Culture can be an extension of life and a tool for improving life, but so far cultures

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:28.920
 have been heavy in the direction of control and reduction rather than expansion.

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:35.000
 Ray, in six months when you're forced to buy the new iPhone and show the grocery person

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.360
 a QR code that you don't have coronavirus so you can buy milk, what are you going to

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.360
 do?

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:41.360
 Leave, I think.

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.360
 Do you think?

01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:43.360
 Where would you go?

01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:58.680
 Yeah, that won't catch on for a long time in small towns in Latin America.

01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:08.560
 In one of the articles you said that civilization's best chance of escaping the fascism is somewhere

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:10.400
 in Western Latin America.

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:17.320
 You didn't specify a country, but do you have one in mind?

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:27.960
 It varies with the type of indigenous people that have influenced that region.

01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:39.480
 There are areas in Mexico where people are just extremely open and humanistic because

01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:43.480
 of the nature of the original culture.

01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:53.560
 They're completely overwhelming the sadistic Spanish-imposed culture.

01:48:53.560 --> 01:49:01.600
 I think there are probably many areas through Latin America where the indigenous population

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:07.520
 has won the mind effectively.

01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:12.240
 In Mexico, it's just a cultural thing that the government and police are totally corrupt.

01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:15.960
 I didn't meet anybody that didn't know that.

01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:22.600
 In America, you have to convince somebody that that is the case.

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:33.000
 The realism is everywhere in Mexico that no matter where you are, you know that people

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.080
 have some basic sanity.

01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:41.920
 You have to be careful in the United States who you're talking to.

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:47.640
 You see that, given how quickly things have changed, you don't see ... Do you think you

01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:50.880
 could even leave in maybe a year or two?

01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:56.440
 Do you think it will get that draconian, or how do you see it playing out?

01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:02.080
 You have to know the back roads.

01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:03.080
 That's good to know.

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:05.640
 I have a question about 5G.

01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:10.280
 I'm sure I already know about Einstein's photoelectric effect.

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:15.360
 That's actually what's used to justify the "safety" of most of these technologies.

01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:18.840
 They're saying, "Well, look, this is non-ionizing radiation."

01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:22.880
 At this point, even the National Institute of Health has come out with papers of its

01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:28.560
 own studies saying non-ionizing radiation is clearly carcinogenic.

01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:33.540
 There's also an effect correlation with the higher frequency.

01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:38.720
 Even though higher frequency penetrates less deeply into the body, it discharges more of

01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:43.560
 its energy, similar to the way the cosmic rays affect you differently, depending on

01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:44.960
 what altitude you're at.

01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:49.200
 Do you think the higher frequency is worse?

01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:59.560
 A lot of it functions as an antenna, like vitamin A and carotene function as an antenna

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:02.200
 for blue light.

01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:10.720
 Riboflavin reacts with blue light, so that's toxic and very harmful to the extent that

01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:14.080
 it gets in your tissue.

01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:25.320
 The whole idea that only ionization is damaging, that's part of why the membrane theory and

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:36.320
 random activity of enzymes, communication, and the cytoplasm as being in ordinary water

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:39.160
 dissolved molecules.

01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:47.120
 If the water is organized and an organizing principle for coherence throughout the cell

01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:58.000
 and tissue, then that becomes an antenna for sound frequencies, all of the various frequencies

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.800
 of electromagnetic oscillations.

01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:15.160
 That's part of the power behind the furious denial of structured water in cells.

01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:23.520
 It opens up this whole range of interaction with the environment that industry furiously

01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:24.520
 refuses.

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:30.160
 So, the higher the frequency, I'm guessing because it's the shorter the wavelength,

01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:36.200
 the more opportunity for molecules in the body to act as an antenna to those frequencies?

01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:37.200
 Yes.

01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:48.960
 The radio waves are the least likely to interact, but when they get down to the wavelength of

01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:58.160
 your brain or your gonad, for example, those wavelengths are especially toxic to those

01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:06.640
 encapsulated organs because the capsule itself captures like an antenna.

01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:10.880
 That's very interesting and it's actually sort of confirmed by the studies that NIH

01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:15.960
 published because they saw different cancers in different organs depending on the frequency.

01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:20.680
 It wasn't a universal cancer effect, it was organ specific.

01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:30.440
 There's a lot of information on that, but it goes against the dogma that says it's

01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:35.360
 all random stuff inside the cell.

01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:38.640
 I was surprised to actually see that study being published by NIH.

01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:41.720
 I thought that these scientists would probably get fired.

01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:43.160
 I haven't checked up on them.

01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:46.960
 They came out last year, but they seem to still be employed.

01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:49.760
 I don't know why they published it.

01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:57.080
 I don't know what the meaning is of what they observe until it gets published.

01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:58.080
 Too late.

01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:00.600
 It's already on the street.

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:06.160
 Something you said in another interview was about how when this all started, who was it?

01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:12.760
 The Iran people that were running Iran were the first people to get the virus.

01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:13.760
 I thought that was interesting.

01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:18.120
 I've only heard one or two other people even talk about that.

01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:20.120
 Can you repeat it?

01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:21.720
 Oh, yeah.

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:28.080
 The parliament in Iran, several of them died very quickly.

01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:39.520
 It was centered on the political people in power exactly as germ warfare ideally works.

01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:45.840
 Do you think a more virulent strain or something like that was released to them or is just

01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:50.440
 the ACE inhibiting properties enough to kill an unhealthy person?

01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:59.080
 No, I think they probably had a more effective strain for the Iran elite.

01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:03.960
 Is there anything to the idea that there isn't a central bank in Iran?

01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:07.020
 I think North Korea is the other place.

01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:12.880
 There has been a concentrated effort to invade these places to set up banks.

01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:24.480
 Yeah, the whole idea of an autonomous government just isn't acceptable.

01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:27.720
 It's a way out like college.

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:34.760
 It was a way out for students to find a place where they could honestly talk to people and

01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:35.760
 learn.

01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:47.240
 If you have an autonomous country, they can do things and come up with new ways of living.

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:53.480
 Just because I'm an economic idiot, but when a bank is in, they establish a central bank

01:55:53.480 --> 01:56:00.120
 somewhere and what are they, loaning money to the country and then they're in debt?

01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:03.520
 Is that how it works?

01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:04.520
 Yeah.

01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:12.880
 Everyone has to be in debt to be controllable and it has to be in dollars.

01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:23.200
 The countries that want to use gold or their own currency, like Libya, was getting away

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:29.960
 from the dollar and creating their own currency and gold for exchange.

01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:33.160
 So they had to be murdered.

01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:39.280
 Speaking of currencies, not many people know, but even though this is already officially

01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:44.440
 admitted by the US government, but the reason Iraq was invaded, aside from the fact that

01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:49.280
 this whole thing with the weapon of mass destruction was a lie, is that Iraq was trying to set

01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:54.520
 up a separate oil exchange that would trade the oil, not in dollars, but in something

01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:55.520
 else.

01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:58.960
 The moment they announced that, within a week, they were invaded.

01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:07.040
 Similar to how MLK was killed the moment he made poverty the issue and not the race.

01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:17.440
 The empire is hoping that shaking down the world economy will delay the evasion of the

01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:24.920
 dollar by the China, Russia, Iran interactions.

01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:32.520
 That's the big threat to the dollar currently and it's the hope that that will be slowed

01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:37.480
 down enough that the empire can survive.

01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:38.920
 Okay.

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:40.240
 Okay.

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:43.280
 Thank you so much for everybody in the chat.

01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:44.280
 Thank you, Georgi.

01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:45.280
 Thank you, Ray.

01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:46.680
 How are we doing on time, Ray?

01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:47.680
 Are you good?

01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:50.200
 I'm just about ready to...

01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:51.200
 Okay.

01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:52.360
 I'm going to let you go.

01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:54.460
 Let me read the super chats real quickly.

01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:55.460
 These are not questions.

01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:57.440
 They're just people that are grateful.

01:57:57.440 --> 01:57:59.280
 John Knight for $10, showing support.

01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:00.280
 Thanks, Danny.

01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:06.800
 Jean-Philippe Groulx-Kinzine for $20.99, Canadian, I think.

01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:09.680
 Helena, $20 Australian, thank you so much.

01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:11.320
 Primitive Initiative, $4.99.

01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:13.240
 I'm not reading these messages.

01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:16.160
 Jean says, "Thank you, Ray, for all of your knowledge."

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:20.740
 Helena says, "I am internally grateful to Dr. Peat, Danny, and Georgi for the wealth

01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:25.880
 of information you share to keep us informed with what is really going on in the health

01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:26.880
 system.

01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:27.880
 Thank you."

01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:31.280
 Primitive Initiative for $4.99 says, "Thank you, Ray, Danny, and Georgi for putting all

01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:33.160
 of this crucial information out there.

01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:36.800
 Let's hope the corrupt fall by their own hands.

01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:37.800
 Amen."

01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:40.920
 Primitive Initiative for another $9.99, just because.

01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:42.520
 Thank you, Primitive Initiative.

01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:44.280
 Pure Therapy for $19.99.

01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:48.040
 I would love to meet you guys and shake your hands personally and express my gratitude.

01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:49.740
 You changed my life.

01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:51.160
 Thank you, Pure Therapy.

01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:52.160
 Kate Dearing for $50.

01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:53.160
 Thank you so much, Kate.

01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:55.880
 She says, "I am super excited to finally listen live.

01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:58.120
 Thank you, Ray, Georgi, and Danny for your time and efforts."

01:58:58.120 --> 01:58:59.240
 Thank you, Kate.

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:01.960
 Matthew Riley for $10 says, "Thank you for everything.

01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:03.920
 It's been truly life-changing."

01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:08.000
 Marshall, I'm going to butcher your last name, Gukina, for $50.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.000
 Wow.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.640
 "I raise my bowl of ice cream to your health, guys."

01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:13.920
 Thank you so much, Marshall.

01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:16.040
 Jacob P. for $10.

01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:18.560
 Thank you, Ray, Georgi, and Roddy.

01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:20.020
 Been here since 2015.

01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:23.740
 Glad to find people who are inspired to share their findings.

01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:24.740
 Thank you, Jacob.

01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:26.540
 Lisa Biskup for $19.99.

01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:29.300
 Thank you all for your valuable discussion and continued efforts.

01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:32.060
 I am always happy to listen to what you three come up with.

01:59:32.060 --> 01:59:33.060
 Thank you, Lisa.

01:59:33.060 --> 01:59:34.420
 Janet Pack for $50.

01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:35.420
 Wow.

01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:37.660
 Thank you for making the time to host this chat.

01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:41.500
 Much gratitude and appreciation for sharing so much knowledge and helping us learn what

01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:42.740
 we can do in times like these.

01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:44.900
 My sister and I send huge amounts of thanks.

01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:45.900
 Thank you, Janet.

01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:48.100
 Harry Burgos for $25.

01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:50.580
 Very informative and enlightening discussion per usual.

01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:51.920
 Thank you for your contributions.

01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:52.920
 Thank you, Harry.

01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:57.700
 Maria Isabel for $9.99 says, "Thank you for having Dr. Peat on."

01:59:57.700 --> 01:59:59.660
 Thank you, Dr. Peat, for being on the show.

01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:00.660
 Thank you, Maria.

02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:04.180
 Belove for $15 says, "What an honor to learn from you.

02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:07.760
 Witnessing truly creative, anti-authoritarian, rational, and complex thinking has brought

02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:09.380
 freedom and healing to my life.

02:00:09.380 --> 02:00:10.380
 God bless."

02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:11.380
 Thank you, Belove, for that.

02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:12.380
 Okay.

02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:18.020
 So, in click, we have 176 people listening at the moment, and I'm sure a lot more later.

02:00:18.020 --> 02:00:21.060
 Kind of in closing, Ray, I mean, what are your thoughts on the future?

02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:29.020
 Like, I know this whole chat has been kind of how grim things are, but what are your

02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:33.060
 thoughts going forward?

02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:40.380
 I think people are reaching a point where they're going to decide they have to choose

02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:46.420
 life and changing the system.

02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:50.540
 What do you see that looking like?

02:00:50.540 --> 02:01:04.540
 Oh, basically, you can't tell, but if people start interacting and actually realizing that

02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:14.460
 it's a desperate choice that has to be made, intelligence is the nature of life, and I

02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:24.700
 think intelligence will come to the surface in the process, and everyone who has knowledge

02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:34.780
 of possibilities is just there to support the process of making decisions, but without

02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:37.420
 knowing what it's going to look like.

02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:44.420
 I'm optimistic without having any idea of what's to come.

02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:47.380
 And Georgi, closing words?

02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:52.060
 In one of his interviews, Dr. Peat said that he would like to see nutrition raised to the

02:01:52.060 --> 02:01:55.100
 respect level of astrophysics.

02:01:55.100 --> 02:02:00.340
 I think that's actually starting to happen right now, mostly by coercion, simply because

02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:04.740
 people will be forced to start taking matters nutritionally into their own hands, simply

02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:10.340
 because the food chain will collapse, if you can even call it providing food or whatnot,

02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:14.040
 but that's the positive side that I'm seeing.

02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:19.660
 People start worrying more about nutrition and its quality and less about exactly what

02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:23.500
 kind of car they drive and what company they work for, if that company even exists in the

02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:24.500
 next few months.

02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:25.500
 I'll call it there, guys.

02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:26.500
 Thank you so much.

02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:27.500
 Ray, stay on the line.

02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:31.060
 We'll just keep you for a minute or two.

02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:32.460
 Georgi, thank you so much.

02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:34.980
 Ray, again, thank you, thank you, thank you.

02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:36.260
 Sincerely appreciate it.

02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:39.860
 Being flexible with the timing and things, it was a true pleasure to have you on again.

02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:40.860
 Thank you so much.

02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:42.140
 Thank you, everybody in the chat.

02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:44.000
 Thank you, everybody who donated.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
 I will forward those to Ray.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000
 Ray, you got the donation last time, correct?

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:50.000
 Right.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.000
 Thank you.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.280
 I just want to confirm.

02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:55.120
 Thank you, guys, everybody.

02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:56.120
 Sincerely appreciate it.

02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:57.120
 I have an amazing audience.

02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:01.040
 Please like this episode because YouTube will do absolutely nothing to promote it and it

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:02.840
 will probably actively hide it.

02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:05.040
 Guys, thank you so much.

02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:07.080
 Again, amazing.

02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:08.080
 Very happy.

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:08.720
 Take care, everyone.
