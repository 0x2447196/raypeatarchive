00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows which run every third Friday of the month from 9,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 oh sorry, from 7 till 8pm, we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 And we manufacture all our own certified organic herb extracts which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 or which are sourced from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000

 Well once again we have our very popular ever present scientist to share his views and opinions with us on this show.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 And that's Dr. Raymond Peat. Dr. Peat thank you for joining us again.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Yeah hi.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Again as always for those people who perhaps have never listened to the show,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 if you would just give people a resume of your background that would be much appreciated.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 1968 to 72 I studied mostly physiology and biochemistry at the University of Oregon.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 And did my dissertation on age related changes in the uterus, oxidative changes.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 And I found that estrogen and polyunsaturated fat tend to accumulate or increase in the tissues with aging and interfere with the use of oxygen.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 And since then I've been working out the implications of that.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 And the topic you mentioned derives from that subject.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Yeah good. Okay so you did say that oxidative changes in utero.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 And I think that's one of the first things I think I'd like you to open up with.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 The parallels between the development that you've mentioned that happens in utero which is very interesting which happens without a scar.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 So whenever a tissue is damaged in utero the scar actually doesn't happen whereas in regular life once we're exposed to the things that you'll bring out scarring is pretty common.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 But there is definitely a way to do something about it isn't there?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 In the uterus early in the development of the embryo there's no blood supply and so the cells are just absorbing oxygen and sugar and amino acids and vitamins and such from their environment.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 And as the cells change every time they divide the environment for each new cell is different.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 The more cells there are the more complex the environment is.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 And if you happen to be next to a hungry cell you won't get the same supply of oxygen and sugar.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 And so the changing shape as the embryo grows interacts with and modifies the supply of nutrients.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 And so the very shape that the embryo develops into is governed partly by the supplies that the mother can deliver to it.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Now this relates to things like brain size or skull size?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Everything.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 For example they knew in the 50s already that if you lowered the blood sugar of a well-developed fetus using either estrogen or insulin which would lower the blood sugar the brain cells would simply stop multiplying as long as the blood sugar was inadequate.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 And if you take a chicken embryo in an egg for example its brain stops growing exactly when the hens provided glucose supply is used up.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 But if you open the egg and inject a little bit of glucose the brain will start growing again and the chicken will develop with a bigger brain than normal chickens ever had.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 So this is why it's so important for pregnant mothers to have optimal nutrition because it's supporting the growth, the brain development and the growth of their baby to an optimal level.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 From the month six to delivery most of the brain cells develop.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 In fact about half of the brain cells that are present at month six die off.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 And that's how you can influence the size of the brain by providing sugar.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 You've mentioned in the past that fructose crosses the placenta like glucose but it doesn't come back to the mother so it's a good sugar to provide.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Yeah it's what the baby wants apparently because it doesn't give any back.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Supposedly it's very traditional in the Steiner philosophy that mothers should eat a lot of honey and honey is very very high in fructose like sugar is as well.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 They're both similar aren't they Dr. Peat?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Yeah.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 Okay so let's open up a little bit more.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 The differences between scarring in adults when they are compromised by what it is they eat and what they don't do and how in utero with the high levels of progesterone and the absence of the polyunsaturated fats scarring is virtually absent.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Yeah there's no inflammation involved in repair.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 If you remove some tissue in the fetus or embryo the adrenine cells simply multiply and fill in with more cells.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Similarly you've left the available nutrient supply increased relatively by taking out some cells and so the neighboring cells have more and can simply grow faster and fill in the space.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 But in a mature animal there are many things that interfere with that.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 There are many mechanisms to make up for that to try to increase the delivery of sugar and oxygen.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 Yeah glucose is largely provided during stress from breaking down proteins.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 First you use up what's stored as glycogen but when that runs out then you have to break down protein.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 That's why it's important to not go longer than eight hours because you use up all of your glycogen in your liver right?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Yeah.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Sorry not to go more than eight hours without eating.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Yeah and the lack of oxygen or the presence of lactic acid which is produced by a lack of oxygen,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 either of those turns on the production of a very simple protein that serves as a supporting material but also as a barrier substance so that cells that are injured put out the framework collagen material.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 But too much of that will increase the distance that oxygen and sugar has to travel to reach the cell so it can make the problem progressively worse.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 The more a cell embeds itself in collagen as a result of the stress so you get more framework material but less functioning cellular material and that's a scar.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 But if you look at the whole life development of the organism, every tissue has to renew itself constantly like your skin and your intestine.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 Everyone knows that those are streaming from the stem cells at the bottom of the layer as the cells multiply and mature they reach the surface where they fall off.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 But every tissue and organ in the body is undergoing the same sort of movement from stem cells to mature functioning cells and that is ideally that's just a continuation of the development of cells in the embryo and fetus.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 They're fed, they multiply, expand and complexify.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 But as things interfere with the ability to use energy or oxygen, the mature animal progressively moves into a generalized inflammatory state.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 It doesn't take a specific wound to turn on these cytokines and hormones and such, histamine and serotonin and so on.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Which are all the backup stress.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Stress itself, a generalized systemic stress starts turning these on in your fat cells, your liver, every organ can produce these and that starts basically to shift the whole body in the same direction that scar formation goes.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Your whole body loses vital functioning cells and replaces them with collagen, inert connective tissue.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 So that old meat for example is tough because it's full of collagen. An old animal hide is thicker and tougher because there's more collagen in it. Kid gloves are delicate.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 But mature goat skin is a thicker kind of leather and that happens in all of the tissues, progressive basically turning towards scar tissue type of function.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 So I just wanted to ask what types of processes inhibit the ideal use of oxygen and sugar in our bodies?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 Well, the thyroid is the basic thing.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Thyroid activates the respiratory enzyme for which copper is the crucial cofactor.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 And so if you load up on iron, an excess of iron is one of the things that tends to displace this crucial copper.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 Anything that interferes with your thyroid function will also interfere with the functioning of this copper containing enzyme. Too much darkness, not enough good light reduces the activity of this enzyme.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 So people need to get lots of sunshine this summer and it doesn't have to be during the hottest time of the day.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Actually it's more ideal if it's not during the burning hours. So it's in the morning or in the later afternoon evening.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 It's the red light that's so regenerative and healing and helps your body use oxygen and sugar more efficiently.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 Yeah, and in the absence of sunlight, if you just shine a very bright incandescent light on your tissues, within a few minutes the oxidative enzymes are activated and reduce stress.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 And of course, the more of your body that's exposed to the red light from the sun is good or from the light bulbs, normal incandescent bulbs.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 But even if you just walk around with short-sleeved shirts and shorts on in the summertime, you'll be getting, it doesn't matter which part of the tissue it touches, any part will help all of the tissues throughout the body.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 Okay, so you're listening to Ask Your Ab Doctor, KMU DeGalbaville, 91.1 FM, from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 You're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated even to this month's subject of cell repair and how to avoid scarring amongst other things.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 Our guest speaker is Dr. Raymond Peat. Thank you again for joining us, Dr. Peat.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 I just wanted to carry on the kind of concept of not scarring. Healing without scarring is pretty new to me in terms of the way I think most people understand the way their bodies work when they get injured, they get cut, generally you form a scar.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 So what you're saying is really, especially in the absence of PUFA, now the polyunsaturates that people consume in their diet from the liquid vegetable oils and the other sources of polyunsaturated oils have a very negative and inflammatory effect in the cascade that would otherwise produce active cell repair without scarring as well as other products would have to be necessary.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 And some of the worst inflammatory agents are produced directly from the vegetable oil polyunsaturated fats, omega minus 6 class form the prostaglandins.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Right. And these are very pro-inflammatory.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 And the fetus is highly protected against those so that people talking about the essential fatty acids have noticed that human babies and calves are born in an extremely deficient state and that's been used to sell the addition of fish oil to baby formula.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 Oh goodness, oh goodness, when actually it's completely the opposite, that they don't need it and don't want it.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 The placenta protects the baby against those fats.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 They don't cross the placenta then?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 No, the sugar that the baby does absorb makes the omega 9 series which are anti-inflammatory.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 So humans haven't eaten these oils in such large quantities ever before until the 1920s and that's part of the reason why there's so many degenerative diseases and we're going to talk about a few more like the pancreatic damage that happens to the beta cells from excess omega 6.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 If you would Dr. Peat, I know in the past you've mentioned this as well but I think to people that are listening would certainly love to hear it again.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 Diabetes, I know you've mentioned that as a typical illustration of that vicious cycle that builds up when polyunsaturates intensify the stress reaction and stress can be just everyday stress, that's true isn't it, just normal stress, it doesn't have to be physical trauma.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Yeah, anytime your blood sugar falls, that's a stress reaction.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 It first calls up adrenaline to move glycogen into the bloodstream largely out of your liver but your muscles have quite a bit of stored glycogen too that they can use and adrenaline first activates that.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 But when you run out of stored glycogen and your blood sugar falls more.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 How long does that take?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Some people do it in two or three minutes but with a good flavor you should be able to go eight hours without any stress.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 That's why as soon as you wake up in the morning you should have a glass of orange juice or something sweet to get your blood sugar back up from the long night of fasting, that's why it's called break fast.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 I didn't mean to interrupt you there Dr. Peat.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 When the blood sugar falls or when you have any stress, the adrenaline after the glycogen is depleted, the adrenaline starts mobilizing free fatty acids out of your fat cells but also out of your other tissue cells where phospholipids are turning down very fast and the phospholipids will come into the blood releasing free fatty acids.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 If you've incorporated a lot of polyunsaturated fats into your tissues, these free polyunsaturated fats happen to not only interfere with sugar metabolism but they also signal more stress hormone production.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 So they will tell your brain that the stress is worse than it was.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 Right, they have an intensifying effect then.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 Yeah, as opposed to the saturated fats which tend to inhibit the stress reaction so it's a self-limiting thing. If you've been a sugar or saturated fat eater and have a stress, you release the saturated fats which are anti-inflammatory and turn off the stress hormones.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 Okay, so that's why if you don't eat then you'll eat yourself. If you don't feed your body then your body will eat itself.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Just a detail for our listeners, Dr. Peat, can you please explain which oils are included in these polyunsaturated fatty acids that we're talking about tonight or otherwise known as PUFA?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 Yeah, all of the things you see widely advertised, corn oil, canola, soybean oil, sunflower oil, sunflower oil, walnut oil, sesame oil, cotton seed oil.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Okay, so to look at, I think again to refresh people perhaps listening, I know that the epidemic of diabetes is certainly taking the quality of life away from a lot of people.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 So perhaps if you illustrate the role of the cause of, well maybe not the cause, but the sequelae of diabetes as a kind of illustration of this stress reaction and the vicious cycle of inflammation.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 Yeah, the American diet in the last 30 or 35 years when the diabetes and obesity have been increasing so much, the polyunsaturated fats are the biggest increase in our diet, not sugar.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 And if you look at the nature of the pancreas, there's a constant renewal of the beta cells that produce insulin in the pancreas.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 So the idea that once you're diabetic, you're doomed to always be diabetic because you don't have the cells in the pancreas, that went out when people discovered the idea of stem cells.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 In one of my newsletters on sugar and diabetes, I mentioned the studies that showed that glucose stimulates renewal of the beta cells in the pancreas.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 So that's sugar for helping a diabetic's pancreas regenerate.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 To renew itself, but since the polyunsaturated fats and the prostaglandins that they form are toxic to the beta cells, if you don't have enough glucose, you'll just keep killing any beta cell that appears.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Even though you do have the stem cells, they'll be converted to beta cells just to get killed by the PUFA.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 And it happens that the stem cell, the flow from the new cell to the mature insulin cell,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 it happens that one of the early stages in this streaming is from the glucagon producing alpha cells in the pancreas.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 The alpha cells turn into beta cells as they mature, and the glucagon producing alpha cell raises the blood sugar.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 And so if you have a lot of the alpha cells in proportion to the beta cells, that will create apparent diabetes because the glucagon causes the breakdown of protein tissue and increases the glucose, which is helpful potentially if it's only a temporary measure.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 So it's like a stress reaction. The body's trying to emergency save the lack of sugar in a diabetic's pancreas by increasing the amount of glucagon to raise the blood sugar.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Yeah, and then if you have a lot of sugar supplied, you don't need the glucagon producing cells, so they move on under the influence of sugar.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 The flow is increased, and you produce the beta cells, and the sugar should be holding down the stress and preventing the free fatty acids, which would form the prostaglandins that would kill the beta cells.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 So this is why you mentioned that study done in England that showed in the early treatment of diabetes, they actually gave the diabetics sugar because they noticed they were losing so much sugar in their urine, and they actually improved.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Something like 12 ounces a day, they said, of the highest quality white sugar.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 Yeah, and they started picking out white sugar.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Because it lowered the stress and allowed their beta cells to fully develop.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 Within just a few days, they stopped producing so much sugar in their urine as they were eating these huge amounts of sugar.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 As they stopped destroying their own tissues, they began gaining weight instead of losing weight.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 Okay, so again, I think this moves on to our next topic, the concept of cell streaming and stem cells.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 Stem cells are a pretty hot topic in the last, certainly the last decade, and I wanted to just make people aware of a couple of different doctrines, and you're in one of them.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 The Hayflick doctrine that I know you've mentioned before in the 60s, basically the one extreme was to say there were no stem cells.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 And then an article that you pointed out that I read earlier from a, well I don't think he's actually Israeli, but he's a Jew, and his name is Gershom Zayachek.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 He's a very famous scholar on the internet about the streaming organism and amongst other things, the Kabbalistic meditative methods of overcoming cancer amongst other things.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 But not to diverge from that, and your opinion about the streaming of cells from one cell type to another is that there really is no point at which cells do not turn into different cells.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 And that ultimately any cell can become a progenitor or a stem cell.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Yeah, that's easiest to see probably in the liver.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 Zayachek has demonstrated that there is a flowing from the portal vein side of the lobule in the liver, moving the cells towards the vein in the center of the lobule.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 But about 50, more than 50 years ago, L.P. Polyzhaev was demonstrating that kind of renewal in muscle cells and even brain cells,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 showing that even mature neurons, given the right kind of stimulation, can undergo mitosis and become new cells.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 One of the current places where this is important is the idea of adrenal fatigue that a lot of people are talking about.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 It ultimately derives from the idea of Addison's disease and a misinterpretation of Hans Zellye's stress research,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 in which he showed that very intense stress would cause the adrenal glands to enlarge and even bleed and then die, and then the animal would die.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 But if the stress is moderate, the adrenal is very good at renewing itself. You can demonstrate the total renewal of the adrenal cortex by scooping out the contents.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 Everything that's inside the capsule of the adrenal gland can be scooped out, and the cells of the inside of the capsule, the fibrous capsule,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 there's a layer of cells that will multiply, and they will, within about three months, produce a fully structured and new adrenal gland.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 So it's the same idea as the pancreas renewing itself, if you give it a chance.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 The same logic that you can see in the feedback systems of sugar and glucagon and the shift to insulin in proportion to the available sugar,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 in the adrenal gland, the cells that are near the capsule are the cells that produce aldosterone or the other class of mineral-regulating steroids.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 As they mature and stream towards the center, they turn into another layer that produces cortisol and the glucocorticoids.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Then at the last stage, they produce the androgens and sex steroids.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 It's amazing how one cell knows how to differentiate into all those different types of cells to produce different hormones.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 It happens that the things that are most stress-producing, like serotonin, for example, or shock,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 will turn on the activity of the glomerulosa layer that produces the aldosterone.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Aldosterone intensifies some of these defensive stress reactions, and people are now starting to speak of it as an endogenous toxin that activates so many of these stress reactions.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 Serotonin is a major factor in turning it on, but it's the first thing produced.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 As the organism starts surviving, if it can get past that shock stage with adequate sugar,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 then the glucocorticoids are produced and finally the sex steroids, which aren't needed if you're going to be in shock and starving to death and so on.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 They're the least important in the emergency mode, but the most important in a healthy mode.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 So this is why it's so important to eat optimal nutrition so that all of your cells can function normally and healthily and regenerate.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 When you are in this healthy state, producing an abundance of progesterone and testosterone, for example, these turn off the aldosterone production.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 So once you achieve the mature, happy state, even though your cells are still there and they're still streaming,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 their function is inhibited the same way that sugar inhibits the function of the glucagon-producing cells.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMU Decalbofil 91.1 FM.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 And from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions here that are related or unrelated to this month's subject of cell repair and how to avoid scarring, amongst other things.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 The guest speaker is Dr. Raymond Peat and the number here if you live in the area is 923 3911.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 Or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-568-3723.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 I just wanted to bring out the point that you'd mentioned that in Africa, and I think the same parallel is something that we heard about or were taught,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 that honey has been traditionally used to heal wounds and is actually very effective at doing that in the absence of antibiotics or other anti-infective measures.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 You also mentioned that sugar can be packed into a wound.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 If you don't have antibiotics even, if you have a fairly large wound and you can pack sugar into it, you have a very good chance of healing it properly.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 Yeah, in Africa when there was no antibiotic available and they had to do chest surgery,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 they simply filled up the chest hole with massive amounts of sugar and they discovered that it not only didn't get infected, but it healed basically without scarring.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 In the newsletter on diabetes, I mentioned some of the references where they find that packing a wound with sugar inhibits the formation of excess collagen and causes almost scarless healing.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 Well, honey never goes bad, right?

00:36:44.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 Yeah, partly it's the osmolarity. It dehydrates things, but it also has the antiseptic ingredients that white sugar doesn't have,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 and it has the fructose, which promotes actual healing instead of scar formation.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 Okay, and some of that also is linked to the fact that the energy supply is present to drive the cellular repair locally.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 Yeah, keeping the energy supply equal to the demand is what short-circuits the inflammation system.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 It goes right to repair like the fetus.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 Okay, well let's move on to another subject. I know that you've talked about a little bit in the past, but we've never really done a show based around it.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 And that was the similarities of toxemia.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 Now this will be a subject that will be of interest and importance to pregnant ladies who perhaps are halfway through their pregnancy or not even.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 But toxemia and preeclampsia have similar effects to what you would expect to see in aging and fibrotic inflammatory conditions as well as atrophy in general.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Yeah, just about everything that happens to a woman in preeclampsia and to the fetus is similar to what is happening to advanced aging symptoms,

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 loss of functional tissue, all kinds of circulatory problems, hypertension, nerve problems, liver malfunction, inflammatory processes everywhere.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 And in the 1950s, Dr. Tom Brewer was shocked when he saw the drug companies promoting the sale of diuretics to pregnant women to prevent edema.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 And at the same time, doctors began advocating salt restriction besides use of diuretics and diet restriction to prevent, supposedly to prevent toxemia because toxemia involves swelling and edema.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 And so the drug companies said, "Here's a diuretic to get water out of the body."

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 But the mechanisms by which it gets water out reduces the blood volume and that tells the kidneys that you need more circulation, more blood,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 and the kidneys signal with renin to activate the adrenals, for example, to produce more aldosterone and to try to increase the blood volume to save sodium.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 Right.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 And so when you cut down sodium, you make the adrenals produce more aldosterone to retain it.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 Right, self-defeating.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 And so Tom Brewer reviewed the evidence already in the 1950s.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 He had a good collection of scientific studies showing that more salt was the cure to toxemia.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 Protein was the thing he mostly emphasized, but protein and plenty of salt and calcium.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 And so milk was the ideal protein because drinking two quarts of milk, you'd get more than 2,000 milligrams of calcium.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 And the calcium is one of the things that helps to turn off aldosterone.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 And the sodium is very powerful at turning off the aldosterone.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 And the aldosterone is one of the immediate villains in producing many of the symptoms, such as leakiness of blood vessels,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 lets the water fall out of your blood, cause your feet and face and such to swell up.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 So just drinking more water just causes more edemas.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 And that's still a common recommendation that doctors give to pregnant mothers.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 I'm not just talking about in general, but actually to pregnant mothers.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 They say, "You need to increase your fluid intake."

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 And they don't mean orange juice or milk or other nutritious liquids.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 They mean water.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 Yeah, the medical profession has pretty much quietly forgotten about the salt restriction and diuretic episode

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 because it probably would be considered a crime against humanity that would lead to replacing medicine with chiropractic or something.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 But now they're still doing silly things like advocating drinking more water.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 Okay, so to get on to calcium and initial, I think a lot of people don't understand this.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 And again, I don't know how it happens.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 I don't know how the whole thing happens with salt restriction being a medical piece of advice and actually causing edema.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 I don't understand how people take it on board that the diuretics they're given are really doing the opposite of what they should be.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 Not what they should be doing, because they shouldn't be used, but that diuretics are actually self-defeating in terms of how they work physiologically

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 and how sugar has been so maligned and how it's so important.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 Calcium, again, is another one.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 So the concept of when you have a low calcium diet, i.e. you're not drinking a lot of milk, you're not eating cheese and the other sources,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 maybe greens and other sources of calcium, that when you have a low calcium in your diet, your blood calcium actually gets bigger.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 The concentration of calcium in your blood increases and that calcium is very damaging to soft tissues.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 Just say a little bit about that, because I think that's another common misconception.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 Yeah, David McCarran, about 30-something years ago, worked at a California university

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 and he noticed that, according to the government's own figures, the people who had the highest blood pressure ate the least salt

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 and the people who ate the most salt had the lowest blood pressure.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 He said there's something wrong with this idea of restricting salt.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 So he looked at the figures and saw that calcium was really the main thing affecting blood pressure.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 He got fired from that university and moved to Portland and had, I guess, about 30 years working at a university in Portland,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 continuing to do research.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 So there are many papers by McCarran showing that it's really a calcium deficiency rather than the sodium excess that causes high blood pressure.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 Because calcium is another thing that will lower the stress hormones and that helps lower blood pressure.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 Parathyroid hormone is what you can see most easily coming down when you eat more calcium and have adequate vitamin D.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 Parathyroid hormone increases aldosterone and so you restrict calcium, your parathyroid hormone goes up,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 that makes your aldosterone stress hormone go up, that makes you increase your blood pressure and retain sodium.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 Okay, I think the last time, this is Ask Your Ob Doctor, it's a quarter to eight.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 So from now until the end of the show at eight o'clock, you're invited to call in.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923-3911 or the 800 number is 568-3723.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 It would be a first for the show if no one called in and I'll take that as a very excited state of listening listeners.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 People are just so plugged into listening here.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 I know sometimes we get lots of calls and at this point in time it doesn't really matter.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 But if you'd like to call, that would be just fine.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 Okay, so the whole calcium thing is another misnomer then.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 That calcium, when you don't take adequate calcium, your blood calcium goes up and calcium gets deposited in the soft tissues.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 And this is also part of the reason why the cardiovascular disease happens in the first place because of the insult we've taken.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 Calcium being taken up into the arterioles and then becoming less flexible.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 Yeah, the parathyroid hormone takes calcium out of your bones and moves it into all the soft tissues,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 the kidneys and arteries where it causes the blood pressure to rise and the arteries to become stiff.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 So a calcium deficient diet leads to hardened arteries and high blood pressure.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 Yeah.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 Okay, we've actually got three callers now.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 So we better start taking some callers.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 Hello?

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 Yes, I know you were just explaining the salt connection, but I want to get a little more clear on that

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 because so many doctors seem to think that salt is just the worst thing in the world,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 especially if you have high blood pressure.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 And recently I had a situation, well, I'm a bit overweight and my blood pressure was high.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 Now I'm on medication that takes care of that.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 It's pretty mild.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 It doesn't have side effects, but I've always liked salt, kind of had a craving for it.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 And I had atrial fibrillation recently, which it turned out was related to suddenly I'd had an overactive thyroid,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 and I'm taking treatments for that to try to balance everything out.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 But the cardiologist thought that I should eat practically cut out salt because she thought that that would help me lose weight

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 and bring my blood pressure down and that the blood pressure could aggravate the atrial fibrillation.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 Although it's interesting that weight doesn't seem to have anything to do with atrial fibrillation like it does other kinds of heart disease.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 So I haven't had an atrial fibrillation attack since I've been dealing with the thyroid balancing it out.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 But in the meantime, I'm wondering about the salt thing.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 I mean, my blood pressure seems to be controlled with the medication.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 Is there any advantage to cutting back on salt for me?

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 Dr. Peat.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 The hypothyroidism causes you to lose sodium, and it's probably the main cause of people having high aldosterone.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.000
 And once you have high aldosterone because of low thyroid or low calcium...

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 Well, I had hyperthyroid. I had an overactive thyroid, and now I'm getting it under control.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 That's often a diagnosis, but it's often doubtful how factual the diagnosis is

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 because stress will cause your TSH to give an indication of hyperthyroidism,

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 and the high stress hormones can give you many of the symptoms of hypothyroidism,

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 but those can very often be cured by a supplement of thyroid.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 I'm actually taking thyroid now to balance me out.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 Did you have a treatment?

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 Yes, I had the radiolidin treatment to shrink my thyroid, so now it's down.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 It's producing less than it should be, and I'm just about at the end of the shrinkage,

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 and so now they've got me on 88 micrograms of thyroid to balance it out so I don't produce less

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 because producing more can be really dangerous, too.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:58.000
 Increased blood viscosity is a major thing causing the rhythm problems, atrial fibrillation.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 Well, they've got me on a blood thinner and a heart regulator.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 Thyroid, by making you able to regulate your minerals, thins the blood,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 and it makes it easier for your heart to pump the blood by lowering the viscosity

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 and regulating the minerals to maintain the right volume of blood at the right viscosity.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 So investigating your thyroid function in more detail,

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 you might not need the blood thinner because thyroid is probably the basic thing

00:50:50.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 that keeps the blood viscosity low, and hypothyroidism is extremely common as a cause of hypertension,

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 and that involves increased albosterone, and that will create the appearance of so-called salt sensitivity,

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:16.000
 a calcium deficiency and low thyroid function make you actually sensitive to salt

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 so that you can raise your blood pressure by taking salt.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 Well, now I'm getting my thyroid balanced to where it's supposed to be,

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 so you're saying that's in my blood naturally.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 They're hoping that that will occur, but where does the salt fit in?

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 Can I have a normal amount of salt without worrying about it?

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 If your calcium intake is well over 1,000 milligrams per day and your vitamin D is good,

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 then there's very little likelihood that you will be one of those salt-sensitive people.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000
 Okay, because I am taking a good amount of vitamin D.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 I've been tested, and I don't have a shortage of vitamin D, which most people apparently do.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 How much calcium do I need again?

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 1,000 or 2,000 milligrams.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 Okay. All right, well, thank you. I'll let somebody else have a turn. Thank you very much.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000
 Thank you. Very cool.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
 Okay, we've got two more callers, so let's see if we can give them both equal opportunity.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 You're on the air.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 Hello?

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:29.000
 Hi. My question is about one of Dr. Peat's newsletters on tissue-bound estrogen and aging,

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 and I was just wondering, he mentioned that for menopausal women,

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 they often get a lot of the estrogen concentration in their tissues as opposed to their blood,

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000
 but progesterone can knock it out of their tissues and into their blood.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 I was just wondering if it would be advantageous if they could take a dose of progesterone

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 and then get a phlebotomy.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 Would that help to decrease the systemic estrogen?

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:03.000
 No. If the liver is working, if you're eating enough protein, and if your thyroid is okay,

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 your liver will send the estrogen straight to your kidneys to be excreted

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 as soon as the progesterone gets it out of your cells into the bloodstream.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 And there are several enzyme systems involved in this.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 The progesterone basically destroys the estrogen receptor that binds estrogen.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 It destroys the enzyme that releases estrogen from the glucuronic form to deposit it in cells.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 It activates the enzymes that add the glucuronic acid to remove it from cells,

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 and it shifts the oxidative enzymes so that they destroy the active form of estrogen.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 So everything progesterone does to estrogen system gets it out of the cells,

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000
 and then your liver will send it to your kidneys to excrete.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 And progesterone helps the liver get rid of the excess estrogen as well.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000
 Yes, progesterone activates the thyroid to do that.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 Okay, so their body would take care of it naturally without having to take the blood out.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 Yes, basically thyroid and protein nutrition are the things that shift the balance.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000
 Okay, excellent. Thanks a lot.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 One more caller. You're on the air.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 Hi, I'm going to talk quick and get to the point because I know you've got a little time.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 I was told that in this culture, because people's diets are so acidic,

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 that there's like a lot of cultures that don't eat any dairy whatsoever,

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 and the white race, but they eat like a lot of fish,

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 and not a lot of fish, like small amounts of fish, but a lot of vegetables,

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 and they get all their calcium just straight from that,

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 and they never take supplements, and they don't have a few process.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 It was told to me that because of the acidic diets that we have,

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 that the body will actually release calcium out of the bones and teeth

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:26.000
 in order to save the arterial walls from being destroyed ultimately from all the acidity,

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 and to try and attempt to alkalize it, and that's why we have so much osteoporosis,

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 and I was just wondering what your thoughts were on that.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 Basically, I was told that it wasn't necessary to take calcium supplements

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 if you were eating a balanced alkaline diet.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 Well, one of the problems with calcium supplements is that some of the co-factors are very bad,

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 like calcium phosphate.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.000
 Some of the supplements have so much phosphate that it's the phosphate that increases

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 the stress hormones and activates the breakdown of the bones.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 But the main things that take calcium out of the bones, besides an excess of phosphate,

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:26.000
 are cortisol, prolactin, and serotonin.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 And those all trigger parathyroid hormone.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 Yeah.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
 And other stress hormones.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 So in terms of the caller's question about the acidic diet,

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 do you think that has a direct effect on calcium mobilization from the bones into the blood?

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 Well, phosphate is the main acidifying thing in the diet,

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 and it mostly comes from beans, whole grains, and seeds and nuts, and meat.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
 Oh, and meat, yeah, of course.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:05.000
 So that's why I think the generalization is that American diet is very acidic,

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 because meat is very acidic, whereas dairy products are actually -- milk is almost --

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
 I mean, it's very neutral.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000
 If anything, it's a little bit alkaline because of the high calcium,

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 and it's actually a calcium deficiency that will cause so much calcium to leach out of the bones

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 and get deposited in the places you don't want it, like your kidneys and your arteries.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.000
 Okay.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 I don't know if that answers the question, but we do only have three minutes left,

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 so we need to give credit to Dr. Peat and let listeners know how they can find out more information for themselves.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000
 Thank you so much.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 Yeah, you're very welcome.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 Thank you for calling, and for those people that called in this evening, thanks for calling.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000
 Okay, Dr. Peat, thanks so much for your time again.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 So Dr. Raymond Peat's website is www.rayPeat.com,

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 and there's lots of scholarly articles there for you to read.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 There's probably something in the region of about 50, and they're all fully referenced,

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:17.000
 and many different topics of contention being exposed for what they are, incredible lies, I think, in short.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 Like I said, a lie travels around the world faster than truth can get her boots on.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
 Yeah, there you go.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 Okay, so we can also be reached, as I said at the beginning of the show, toll-free,

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:35.000
 during Monday through Friday, 1-888-WBM-ERB, and in a few days here, it'll be the solstice,

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 the middle of the year, and the days will start to get slowly shorter,

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000
 but at this point in time, the sun's right in the middle of the sky,

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000
 and people's thyroid should be doing good from all the sunlight.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.000
 So vitamin D is going good, and people keep this polyunsaturated fats out of your diet,

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 and you'll be going a long way to improving your health.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 Anyway, more next month, the third Friday of next month, so thanks for listening.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
 Thank you for listening.
