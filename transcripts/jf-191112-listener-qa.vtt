WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.720
 Well, welcome to the Get Fit with Jodell show. I am super stoked because it's time for another

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.440
 mind-blowing episode with Dr. Ray Peat. Dr. Peat and I decided to do listener questions

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.840
 today so I can hardly wait to hear his responses to some really great questions that people

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.400
 put up on the posts and on my Facebook and things like that. So I appreciate you guys

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.480
 asking questions and Dr. Peat, I appreciate you because once again I'm so honored beyond

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.120
 words to have you with me. Thank you so much. So are you ready for this slew of questions?

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.520
 Yep, go ahead. Okay, great. Well, we'll start with this person wanted to remain anonymous

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.040
 but they said and it was kind of an interesting question. They said, can you give us your

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.040
 opinion on the current fitness trends and also what your daily exercise looks like?

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:07.320
 So this one's a little personal to you, Dr. Peat. Oh, I never exercise. Well, once about

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:17.240
 every 10 years I do some exercises just to see how things are working. But the idea of

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:29.960
 exercise I think is not biologically sound. I think all of your activities should be intentional

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:39.800
 in some way constructive or at least play forgiving. And the idea of exercise seems

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:49.640
 to be more fulfilling a duty or obligation rather than doing something just because it's

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.520
 fun or productive. Yeah, so that kind of takes me down. I'm going to go a little further

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.400
 down on my list because there was another person that asked a similar question about

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.600
 exercise and this was an individual who likes to run. And this woman said, if a woman would

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.280
 like to run on a regular basis for enjoyment, is that something that's beneficial and does

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:22.440
 she need to be more vigilant as far as PUFA intake and environmental estrogens? If you

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:38.440
 have a very pretty place to run in, like the natives of northern Mexico have canyons and

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.680
 interesting sceneries to run through just to do their social visits and tend to their

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:56.840
 chores and such. So running is part of their lives. But it's also meaningful in many ways.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:06.440
 It isn't just running down the street to a certain point and coming back. The rote-ness

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:15.160
 of it, the predictability and the sameness of it I think is actually somewhat harmful

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.960
 to your nervous system. Yeah, so what you're saying is more you're thinking in terms of

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.360
 movement. Like people need to move their bodies but not necessarily getting on a treadmill

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:35.960
 or an elliptical machine to hash out 45 minutes just because they feel like they should. Yeah,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:44.280
 the brain, the mind has to move at least as much as the body. And when you're on a treadmill

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:53.320
 or running down a certain track, your mind is not moving. Your body is moving but your

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:05.240
 mind is in a rut. And being in a rut is biologically harmful. From a stress standpoint, right?

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.120
 So sometimes these exercises that we're trying to do to get our bodies in shape, if we don't

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:19.640
 enjoy them, they can actually be stress-inducing, yes? Yep. And deepening the rut, a habit of

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:29.960
 doing something that isn't pleasurable or meaningful deepens your tolerance for meaninglessness

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:41.080
 and you're at risk of sinking into routine behavior and routine life. Yeah, I like that.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.040
 I like not living a life, like you said, not a meaningless existence or having meaningless

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.800
 in your life. We need to have meaning in everything we do. So I like that approach. The next question

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:59.000
 is, "Dr. Peat, could you please tell us the difference between a dairy allergy and lactose

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.560
 intolerance? Like what different symptoms would we expect between the two and what can

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.560
 we also do in case it's actually a dairy allergy?" So I guess in terms of them saying, "If it

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.160
 is a dairy allergy versus the intolerance, what can we do?" And I'm sure you have some

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.080
 insight on this as to what they can do to kind of make the intolerance go away because

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:34.440
 I've heard you talk about that. Yeah, an allergy can be deadly. A mild allergy is just annoying.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:45.480
 It makes, if it's on your tongue or mouth, it makes it burn and maybe swell up a little.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:55.000
 If it's serious, it will make your membranes swell up just to a hideous extent so that

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:04.600
 you can't move your tongue, can't swallow. And any of the surfaces that it reaches, if

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:12.280
 it's a real allergy, it can stop the function and make it impossible to breathe, for example,

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:25.240
 which is fatal. But a lactose intolerance is simply the inability to absorb and digest

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:34.680
 milk sugar. And if you have a sugar in your intestine that can't be absorbed, it has a

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:43.960
 laxative effect and it tends to run through you. Or if you have the wrong kind of bacteria,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:52.840
 the bacteria can convert it to gas. And so gas is the most common symptom for lactose

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:59.480
 intolerance. And so like I've heard you mention before, if somebody does have an intolerance,

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.600
 I've heard you talk about how different approaches towards nutrition can actually help that

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.720
 individual develop a tolerance and be able to eat dairy, yes?

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:22.440
 Yeah. Deficiency of thyroid hormone creates various inefficiencies metabolically. Low

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:32.520
 production of digestive enzymes is typical. Low stomach acid sometimes. And the enzymes

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:39.800
 to digest lactose, among other things, will be low when your thyroid hormone activity

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:50.360
 is low. And so most thyroid people, as a rule, to some extent have a lactose intolerance.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:58.200
 And just fixing the thyroid function will improve their digestion of milk. There were

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:11.000
 studies of people who were theoretically genetically unable to digest lactose because of their

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.680
 race. And the tests done in those people, starting with half a glass of milk or a quarter

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:27.000
 of a glass of milk every day, doing that for a few weeks, they found that these genetically

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.680
 intolerant people were able to induce the enzyme. The enzyme is there in infancy and

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:45.720
 it's just a matter of keeping it active or reinducing it as an adult by giving your intestine

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:51.960
 the exposure to a daily amount of lactose.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:57.000
 Okay, that's interesting. So I'm going to throw in my own question here. So let's say

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.240
 somebody, like you said, we have that since infancy has the ability to digest dairy, but

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.200
 like all of a sudden in their older years, they can't digest it anymore. Like what would

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.360
 be the cause of that? Would that have to do with the low thyroid and like you were mentioning

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.360
 the low stomach acid?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:23.640
 Or a vitamin deficiency. And vitamin deficiencies and thyroid deficiencies often go together.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:34.320
 As your digestive system slows down from low thyroid, you will absorb poorly and be more

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.360
 likely to get a vitamin deficiency.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:43.880
 Okay, well then hopefully that's helpful to that listener that they can start to maybe

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.400
 take some thyroid and be able to replenish their ability to take in dairy. Because that

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.080
 actually happened to me. Once I got my thyroid working after that toxic mold exposure, I

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.360
 was able to do dairy again, which before I'd been having problems with it. So yeah, I think

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.480
 you're obviously spot on.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:11.960
 I've known people who recovered from a variety of very different kinds of allergies or sensitivities.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:17.880
 Aspirin sensitivity is another thing that is supposed to be genetic. But I have a friend

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:26.440
 who was, for 55 years of his life, he was thought to be aspirin intolerant. And now

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.440
 he takes aspirin every day.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.160
 Wow, that's fantastic. Okay, so there is hope for those people that have intolerances

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.520
 to certain things. The next question we got was, what is the root cause of grinding of

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.880
 the teeth? Or I guess it's called bruxism, is that right?

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:55.320
 Yeah, and serotonin excess is one of the things that happens during the night. And usually

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:05.280
 an irritation in the intestine during the night. As your blood sugar goes down, your

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:14.520
 nerves and immune system become more irritable because of the falling energy supply. And

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:20.360
 that irritability during the night, even though the food wasn't causing an allergic reaction

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:29.320
 during the daytime, during the night, the falling blood sugar makes you start sensing

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:35.160
 relatively toxic things in your intestine or irritating things. And that causes the

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:49.840
 intestine to increase its production of serotonin. And serotonin is closely connected with bruxism.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.560
 That's really interesting. So someone would want to get their serotonin levels down in

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.600
 order to prevent that from happening.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:07.200
 Yeah, usually just looking at your diet and finding things that are not well digested.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:16.160
 Green salads are the worst offenders. They never can be digested by a human being. And

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:25.280
 so they feed whatever bacteria or fungus happens to be in your system. And then the fungus

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:33.840
 or bacteria will make toxins that irritate the intestine so that it overproduces things

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.240
 such as histamine, serotonin, and nitric oxide.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:44.000
 Yeah, I can't tell you how many people will, well, women especially will say, "Well, I

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.360
 have a green salad every day and yet I have a lot of digestive issues." You know, we want

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.200
 to tell them, "Well, here's your sign. That's why it's happening." Like you said, we can't

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.680
 digest all of those greens.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:04.640
 Yeah, we simply don't have enzymes to digest them. There were experiments with rats feeding

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:13.520
 them fresh, raw vegetables or the same vegetables that had been canned at very high temperature

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:22.480
 and pressure. And supposedly the nutrients are lost by high temperature cooking, but

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:29.720
 actually because it breaks down the cellulose, it actually makes more nutrients available

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:38.320
 so that the rats wasted away when they were fed fresh vegetables but thrived on the canned

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:48.400
 vegetables of exactly the same sort. And you can do an experiment if you put a bit of green

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:56.080
 salad into a plastic bag and then keep it at body temperature for two or three days,

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:04.240
 which would happen after you ate it. See what happens to the fresh green salad after two

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:13.360
 or three days of body temperature. Usually a foul mess.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.520
 I can imagine that would be a fun party trick to show your friends. Like, "Look what's happening

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:24.480
 to salads when we eat them." Okay, so Rachel asks the next question. She says, "What does

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.560
 Dr. Peat feel are the better exercises," of course we touched on that, "foods, supplements

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.920
 for middle-aged women in regards to lowering chronic stress or cortisol? I know getting

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.280
 outdoors in nature and plenty of sunshine are huge lifestyle factors in helping this,

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:51.440
 but what else? And as always, thank you." If you live in a woodsy, cold climate, cutting

00:14:51.440 --> 00:15:01.000
 wood and stacking it in the summer months is a good, useful exercise that uses your

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:11.600
 muscles. And in the winter, or if you don't have wood to cut, dumbbells are the closest

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:19.960
 thing to getting muscle use. I love that you just said that because I went

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:27.200
 camping recently and my husband and my brother were showing me how to chop wood for the fire

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.640
 and I fell in love with it. I told them, "I want to learn how to be a really great wood

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.720
 chopper." And it was such a great workout and yet it was fun too and it was almost like

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:45.400
 a stress reliever too. Yeah, and with a good Crescet saw, you can

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:54.840
 saw logs for the fireplace and get push and pull exercise on your arm muscles using alternate

00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:02.280
 arms on a Crescet saw. It's like a very expensive exercise machine.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.040
 I love that. I'm going to give that a try too because I was just using an ax and chopping,

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.320
 so I got the chopping mechanism, but I didn't do the push-pull. Now, she also asked what

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:19.320
 supplements or nutrition do you recommend as far as lowering chronic stress and cortisol?

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:30.280
 Things that are easy to digest and that don't lower your blood sugar are the most powerful

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:38.200
 anti-stressors. Calcium, keeping the ratio of calcium to phosphate very high in your

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:51.680
 diet has a relaxing anti-stress effect. When your muscles are active and growing, they

00:16:51.680 --> 00:17:01.120
 actually produce some testosterone. When they're under stress and not being used properly,

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:11.240
 they tend to convert cholesterol into cortisol and actually create the stress syndrome. The

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:20.720
 unused muscle is slightly toxic under some conditions where the used muscle is adding

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:27.800
 to your steroid protective hormones. Wow, okay. I'm going to throw in a question

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:35.000
 here too. Since you have a lot of history in Mexico, living down there and such, I have

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.680
 kind of a favorite starchy vegetable that's jicama. I was wondering your thoughts on jicama

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:47.560
 as far as a food that might be good for digestion or not, or what do you think about jicama

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:54.120
 in general? I've eaten a lot of it, and I don't generally

00:17:54.120 --> 00:18:04.000
 tolerate starch as well. For example, cucumbers give me terrible gas, and even cantaloupes

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:12.320
 are too gas-forming for me. But I never had trouble with jicama. I don't know what it

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:24.040
 is, but it is a starch, but it isn't famously gas-producing. Yeah, I noticed that for myself

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.120
 that I found it easy to digest, but there are so many other raw vegetables that if I

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.760
 would try to eat them in the raw state, then I would have problems, but not that one. So

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:37.080
 I wonder if it's because it may be part of the tuber family, like a potato.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:46.920
 It's in a very different family, but it's probably a different set of allergens and

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.160
 antigens. Okay, well good to know. I've been wanting

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:55.800
 to ask you that for a while, so that's good. Okay, and then Tina asks, "Does Dr. Peat advise

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:02.080
 those coming from calorie-restricted eating and intermittent fasting protocols to slowly

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:07.320
 increase food intake and possibly count calories?" So that's her first question. So what do you

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:12.400
 think about somebody coming from calorie-restricted and intermittent fasting, and how would they

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.280
 slowly increase their food intake and count calories, or should they?

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:28.000
 The important thing is to watch your temperature and pulse rate as indicators of how energetic

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:35.360
 your metabolism is. It's normal for your metabolic rate to go down during the night, but after

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:45.120
 breakfast you should pop right up to a working temperature of 37 degrees Celsius or 98.6

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:55.040
 Fahrenheit, and a pulse rate of more or less 80 or 85 beats per minute, I think, is good

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:01.080
 during the day. Great, and also her second part of her question

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:07.920
 was, "Should we take T4 with T3, or does Dr. Peat advise just taking T3?"

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:25.920
 The value of T3 in a free form is that if you're in a hurry to correct a problem, you

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:34.000
 can use a physiological replacement amount of T3, such as between one and four micrograms

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.920
 per hour. And like with a meal, where you're going to be absorbing food for two or three

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:52.480
 hours, 10 micrograms with a meal is a pretty physiological amount. And you can see if that

00:20:52.480 --> 00:21:03.760
 relieves your symptoms. I've seen very serious symptoms disappear in as little as a minute

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:15.840
 after taking a five or 10 microgram dose of T3. Insomnia will very often disappear five

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:25.360
 minutes after chewing up a bit of T3. You don't have the usual delay in getting to sleep.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:35.200
 And pains, arthritic pains or breast pains, for example, will disappear in from five to

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:48.080
 15 minutes after taking some. So it's valuable for its essentially instantaneous repair functions.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:22:02.320
 But it goes away almost as fast as it takes effect. And I, for a time, was taking 25 micrograms

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:09.920
 in the morning all at once. And after doing that for a couple of weeks, at sunset, my

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:19.760
 heart would begin stopping every 10 seconds for two or three seconds at a time. And once

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:30.400
 it stopped so long that I started blacking out with a shrinking visual field and had

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:41.920
 to cough repeatedly, yet my heart started again. So I realized that taking an outsized

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:53.920
 dose all at once after a week or two, your liver starts eliminating the T3 at an exaggerated

00:22:53.920 --> 00:23:06.080
 rate because it doesn't recognize that as a natural process. And after 12 hours of the

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:14.160
 liver excreting it at that high rate, if you don't replace it, suddenly you've gone to

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:24.320
 an extremely hypothyroid state, which leads to heart arrhythmia as the worst symptom.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:36.360
 And if you take the T4 only, a very healthy person, they tested it in the 1940s on male

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:46.600
 medical students and said thyroxine, T4 only, had exactly the same effect that the full

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:56.440
 thyroid substance had on these healthy young men. But they didn't test it on women. And

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:06.280
 it happens that estrogen affects the liver and the thyroid gland, blocking secretion

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:17.600
 of the hormone from the gland and slowing the metabolic process of the liver. So it

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:27.720
 turns out that women have about five times the incidence of thyroid-related disease and

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:41.400
 autoimmunity is closely connected to that feminine thyroid-estrogen interaction. So

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:53.680
 T4 is very fine as a replacement only for healthy people. But people who have a metabolic

00:24:53.680 --> 00:25:03.880
 problem, mostly women, it's exactly the wrong thing to use. But since you don't want to

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:18.000
 have to take four micrograms of T3 half a dozen times a day, if you take T4 in the evening,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:27.720
 for example, once a day, those of T4 will help to sustain things through the night.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:43.080
 But it should be accompanied by ideally one or two doses of T3 during the daytime. The

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:55.240
 sustaining effect of T3 during the night means that when you're exposed to the T3, it should

00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:04.680
 activate your liver, keep the estrogen from accumulating. The liver excretes excess estrogen

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:13.120
 and the active liver will activate the thyroid gland, protecting it from the blocking effect

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:24.560
 of estrogen. So given the supporting effect of T3, then a woman's liver can metabolize

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.200
 T4 just like a man's.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:34.280
 Wow, okay. That was something that I had been interested in learning about too because I

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:40.760
 have seen people take T3 and then they say that after a couple weeks they no longer can

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:46.140
 notice the difference on it. Would that be because the liver is starting to push some

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.680
 of it out since they're taking it and now they need to up their dose?

00:26:49.680 --> 00:27:03.160
 Yes, if you take 5 or 10 or 20 micrograms at once, your liver is going to develop super

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:09.240
 excretory enzymes to lower it faster than normal.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:14.480
 Okay and then taking T3 sounds like a way to remove excess estrogens from the body,

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.480
 is that correct?

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:21.440
 Yes, and that will help you handle the T4.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.280
 Well speaking of excess estrogen, there was another listener, Diego, he had a question

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:33.640
 about anti-aromatase products such as Exemastain. So he said, "What do you think of anti-aromatase

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.440
 products like Exemastain, also known as Aromazin?"

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:51.880
 Yes, those generally have fairly serious side effects. The one of them which is a steroid,

00:27:51.880 --> 00:28:01.520
 I forget whether that's the one you named, the steroid-based one is the least toxic of

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.280
 the aromatase inhibitors.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:10.160
 So probably needs to be careful with that then if there are some pretty harsh side effects,

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.160
 yeah?

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:24.240
 Yeah, and there are safe aromatase inhibitors, aspirin and progesterone for example, do a

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.240
 very good job.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.880
 Yeah, that's a much better point, much safer to take those things for sure. Okay, we have

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:37.560
 a gal named Christy that had a couple of questions. The first question is, "I'm losing weight

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:43.520
 and my hands and feet are cold even with natural thyroid medication and I'm getting colder,

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.520
 so why is that?"

00:28:44.520 --> 00:29:02.560
 It's important to check temperature and pulse rate as well as how you're feeling. If you

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:11.320
 have been reducing your intake of nutrients, you might have reduced some essential nutrients

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:21.800
 so much that you're in a stress state. High cortisol can make you lose weight under stress,

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:32.880
 but it will be primarily muscle weight. Dieters used to go on a very low calorie diet or even

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:42.920
 fast and find that they could lose 10 or 12 pounds in a week or 10 days. Someone did a

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:51.600
 study analyzing what was happening to the body and they found that on an extremely low

00:29:51.600 --> 00:30:07.040
 calorie diet, the weight loss was about 80% protein and only something like 15 or 20%

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:17.920
 fat. But if they took a moderate amount of nutrition, enough to reduce the stress hormones,

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:31.400
 they could lose 80% fat and only 15 or 20% protein tissue. It's essential to keep your

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:38.120
 adequate nutrition while lowering calories. The adrenaline will come up and bring cortisol

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:45.720
 after, and the cortisol is what makes you lose muscle.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.680
 So instead, she might try adding some more calories and would it serve her if her adrenaline

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:59.520
 is high to add carbohydrates? Definitely, yes. The carbohydrate at the right

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:07.640
 amount will spare the protein. So 80 grams of protein a day, for example, if you're getting

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:17.800
 the carbohydrate from orange juice, for example, comes with minerals. Potassium has a sparing

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:28.920
 effect on the protein besides the sugar. So fruit juice plus the adequate amount of protein

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:38.920
 will keep your metabolism up and tend to promote fat loss rather than protein loss.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:44.340
 That's a very good tip because anytime I've drank orange juice, I always feel warmer right

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:49.280
 after I drink it. So I'm wondering if she would take her temperature prior to drinking

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.760
 it and then after she might notice that she's getting less cold when she does that. Do you

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:59.680
 agree? Yeah, you have to allow time for the effect

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:09.280
 of the cold orange juice to wear off. If you drink warm orange juice, then you'll see the

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:14.120
 warming effect immediately. Okay, very good. The second part of her question

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:20.960
 was she doesn't have a uterus because she had it removed and her doctor told her that

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.840
 she doesn't need to take it. She's taking progesterone, but her doctor said you don't

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.480
 need to take progesterone if you don't have a uterus and she wanted to know if that was

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:36.680
 true. Many doctors thought that was true 60 years

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:50.200
 ago, but I didn't know anyone still said that. Last time I saw that was I think 1970, roughly.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:33:03.040
 It's a kind of horrifying thing to think that a doctor still can believe that progesterone

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:21.640
 has use only to the uterus. Progesterone is one of the most basic molecules in the universe

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:33.120
 and starting right from the ovum itself, it is involved in the structure of the ovum which

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:43.760
 organizes the genes, the cell division mechanism, everything from the beginning of the organism

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:58.760
 up and as the organism matures, even before puberty, progesterone is in charge of brain

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:10.160
 development. If progesterone is low during gestation, the brain fails to develop. When

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:23.520
 it's given as a supplement to the brain, it becomes super able, bigger and more functional

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:33.280
 in animal experiments as well as humans. In the mature adult brain, progesterone is a

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:42.720
 major steroid, 10 times higher in the brain for example than circulating in the blood.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:57.600
 So you might say that the uterus is a very minor field of operation for the progesterone

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:10.080
 molecule. It governs brain growth, brain function. If it's low, a woman will experience epileptic

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:22.120
 seizures when the brain progesterone falls too low, mood, depression, deficiency of progesterone

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:29.120
 affects every aspect of life.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:45.120
 Question from Christy. She wanted to know are sulfur supplements good or bad such as

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.120
 in the form of MSM?

00:35:48.120 --> 00:36:03.120
 When people email me that question, I send them a couple of articles from about 40 years

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:13.120
 ago I think it was. A woman in a California hospital was brought in and she exploded in

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:23.120
 the operating room. She died and several of the staff were injured. Analyzing the chemistry

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:35.120
 of what happened, the best hypothesis seems to be that she was using MSM to treat a cancer

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:45.120
 using very large amounts of it. Some fluke in the way it metabolized led to that toxic

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:57.120
 explosion. That only happened once but I think it's good for people to be aware of that chemical

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:09.120
 analysis that was done in California as an indicator of how little is known about the

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:23.120
 supplements that people so commonly use without knowing very much about the actual chemistry.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:28.120
 So she literally exploded, like her body exploded?

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:45.120
 Yeah, or the gases around, they had opened a big incision. A surge of emissions, I think

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:54.120
 it was described as an explosion, but the fumes quickly knocked out several of the staff.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:38:00.120
 Yeah, well that's definitely a supplement that we want to stay away from. I know you

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:05.120
 mentioned that they took it for cancer, but why do people take MSM? I've never recommended

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.120
 it to my clients, but are there other reasons people take it and is there something they

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.120
 could take instead?

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:20.120
 If they're doing it as an anti-inflammatory, yeah there are lots of anti-inflammatory things.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:32.120
 The safest approach I think is to try to look at causes and see what the particular problem

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:40.120
 is. Low blood sugar leads to inflammation, too much unsaturated vegetable oil in the

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:51.120
 diet amplifies inflammation, too much phosphate in the diet relative to calcium is a very

00:38:51.120 --> 00:39:02.120
 powerful promoter of inflammation. Things that over-activate the parathyroid gland will

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:13.120
 lead to inflammation, fibrosis, calcification. The thing that these supplements are recommended

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:26.120
 for, they almost always have a clear cause that can be approached. Supplementing calcium,

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:37.120
 for example, avoiding things that are over-rich in phosphates, too much wheat, too many beans,

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:44.120
 too many nuts, for example, those are all heavy in phosphates.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:50.120
 Yeah, I can't tell you how many people I talk to about going off of nuts and seeds and for

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:56.120
 whatever reason, PUFA as well as oxalates as well as inflammatory responses like what

00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:01.120
 you're talking about and how much better they feel after even less than a week they notice

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:06.120
 the difference being off of nuts and nut butters and seeds and things like that.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:12.120
 Okay, so Trudy asks, "I would love to know Dr. Ray Peat's stance on colostrum powder

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:17.120
 and powdered milk."

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:27.120
 One thing that I just ran across a few months ago was that the dehydrating and powder producing

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:39.120
 industry has sometime in recent years, they have begun using nanoparticles to prevent

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:53.120
 clumping of their powders and colostrum is a good idea. Powdered milk is just a wonder

00:40:53.120 --> 00:41:03.120
 food for convenience. I've used hundreds of pounds of it myself but recently running across

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:16.120
 this bit on the new technology, just so that the powder will flow easily, they're actually

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:28.120
 microscopically coating it with nanoparticles and I haven't found any industry source which

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:35.120
 admits that they're using it but on the internet you can look at nanoparticles and powdered

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:42.120
 milk products. You can find lots of articles about the use of it, people selling the technology

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:55.120
 to be used and these nanoparticles, if they're in a particular size range, are carcinogenic

00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:06.120
 and pro-inflammatory. For several months I haven't been recommending some of my favorite

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:16.120
 recipes such as the powdered milk pancakes, flourless pancakes and biscuits and so on

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:24.120
 because of the uncertainty of how these powders are being produced.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.120
 Yeah, there's so many things that start out great and then they process them a different

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:34.120
 way and we as health advocates have to say, "Okay, well at one time I recommended those

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:39.120
 but now I can't because they're changing the processing of it." So that's unfortunate.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:49.120
 Yeah, that happened with vitamin C in the mid-1950s. The research that made it famous

00:42:49.120 --> 00:43:00.120
 was done in the 40s and early 50s and I used it myself and with two tablets, tiny tablets

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:11.120
 of 50 milligrams each, I ended a very intense poison oak allergy so that I could work in

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:22.120
 the lab without a trace of poison oak sensitivity just after basically 100 milligrams of synthetic

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:31.120
 vitamin C. But the next time I took it, it had come down in price by about 90% and the

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:40.120
 tablets were now 500 milligrams instead of 50 milligrams and it caused cold symptoms

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:49.120
 and other allergy symptoms when I took it. And after my own experience, I started mentioning

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:57.120
 that to other people who had chronic sinus inflammation, runny nose, post nasal drip,

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:09.120
 cough, hemorrhoids, all kinds of mysterious ailments, I mentioned my experience with synthetic

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:20.120
 vitamin C and a huge percentage of these people with chronic inflammatory problems solved

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:24.120
 when they stopped taking their supplements.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:30.120
 Wow, yeah, there's so much I've learned from you in particular about supplements and the

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:35.120
 things that are in them, kind of like the newsletter you had on silica and silicon dioxide,

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:39.120
 like how these supplements start out so great and then they use these products that really

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:45.120
 give us no reason to take them because we don't really want to be bringing sand particles

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.120
 into our digestive tract.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:50.120
 Yeah, nano sand.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:57.120
 Yeah, okay, well there you go. Okay, so this next question, this is kind of a loaded question

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:03.120
 and hopefully you can explain to the listeners what exactly these big terms are. I'm familiar

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:09.120
 with them but I want to hear from you. So it says, "Can you ask Dr. Peat about pheochromocytoma,

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:16.120
 paragangliomas, adrenal tumors, what we can do with this disease and is there a connection

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:21.120
 to thyroid diseases and pheochromocytomas?"

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:33.120
 I suspect that there is. The people that I've known with the diagnosis, I have urged them

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:42.120
 to check their thyroid function and it happens that the people who have been diagnosed with

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:53.120
 that were actually hypothyroid. In the absence of good thyroid function, the body looks for

00:45:53.120 --> 00:46:09.120
 alternative ways to keep working and one is to over-activate that particular kind of cell.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:19.120
 It can go in different directions. Excess serotonin is one of the products. Excess adrenergic

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:33.120
 chemicals is another route. I think of it as the body's inventing ways to get around

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:47.120
 an energy block or limitation. That happens with many of the regulatory endocrine systems.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:56.120
 For example, with animals, many years ago they found that if you removed one ovary of

00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:11.120
 an animal, the other ovary was very likely to develop cancer. The mechanism was because

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:23.120
 the pituitary gland was producing enough activating gonadotropin for two hormones, it became more

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:35.120
 active to make one ovary do the work of two ovaries. It was over-stimulating that ovary,

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:46.120
 driving it to the point that it became a tumor or a cancer. In thyroid, there is good evidence

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:55.120
 that the same thing happens when you are deficient in some nutrient needed to make the thyroid

00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:06.120
 hormone or have something blocking the production of the hormone. Your pituitary becomes hyperactive,

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:19.120
 your GSH rises and chronically over-stimulates the thyroid gland, leading to thyroid cancer.

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:29.120
 Women, I don't know what the proportion is, but they are more susceptible to developing

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:38.120
 thyroid cancer because of the estrogen blocking the secretion of the hormone and the pituitary

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:47.120
 having to work harder. I think it's the same chemical that can be used for a prolactin

00:48:47.120 --> 00:49:00.120
 secreting tumor, bromocriptine or cabergoline or the chemicals used to treat a prolactinoma.

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:12.120
 Some of those can be used to treat the Cushing's syndrome and I think if you keep the pituitary

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:22.120
 under control so that it isn't over-stimulating your adrenals, you will reduce the risk of

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:29.120
 all of this. Once you get a tumor in the adrenal, it's too late to work on that level of the

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:43.120
 pituitary. Low thyroid function leads to increased prolactin, for example, as well as the thyroid

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:57.120
 stimulating hormone. The excess of gonadotropins often follows the excess of thyroid stimulating

00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:11.120
 hormone and prolactin. Serotonin, which rises from either irritation in the digestive system

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:21.120
 or from a response to hypothyroidism, serotonin happens to drive all of the pituitary hormones.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:34.120
 So stress that leaves you with chronic serotonin excess can contribute to all of the tumor

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:40.120
 developments that are driven by the pituitary gland, which would include different types

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:55.120
 of adrenal tumors, thyroid tumors, ovarian tumors, all of the endocrine tumors.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:03.120
 Okay, very good. The next question comes from John and it says, "What are your thoughts

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:10.120
 on the herbal form of ephedra, also known as Mao Hang? Is this something that can be

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.120
 beneficial?"

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:23.120
 Yeah, I've used it from the time I was four years old, I think, and first had migraine-like

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:38.120
 headaches. I had another Mao Hang tea, a desert tea it was called, and it's a powerful stimulant,

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:54.120
 it wakes you up. Some people have used it in an excessive, chronic way, using it just

00:51:54.120 --> 00:52:04.120
 for its stimulating purpose or for weight loss, for example. In chronic, excessive use,

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:13.120
 it contains things that are toxic to the liver, but if it's used occasionally, medicinally,

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:17.120
 for example, to treat nausea or a headache.

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:22.120
 Great. And yeah, with regard to weight loss, it kind of stimulates the beta receptors,

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:27.120
 is that right? So it's harder, like for the stubborn fat areas, I remember that from

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:32.120
 my bodybuilding days, everybody was on ephedra because it would stimulate the beta receptors

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.120
 instead of the alpha receptors.

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:48.120
 Yeah, but free fatty acids are the result, and free fatty acids are what make fat toxic,

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:56.120
 so it's better to eliminate the fat slowly and carefully rather than pushing it out with

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:59.120
 a stimulant like Mao Hang.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:04.120
 Yes, I agree. Okay, two more questions and then I think we'll wrap it up, but the next

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:11.120
 question is from Ann and it says, "What is your remedy, Dr. Peat, for cellulite? What

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:17.120
 would be your cure-all or a way to begin to heal a cellulite issue?"

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:35.120
 The immediate thing is to check your temperature, metabolic rate, look at your calorie and

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:49.120
 water consumption. You should be evaporating at least two liters of water every day that

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:58.120
 you can account for. So if you drink, for example, two quarts of orange juice and two

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:13.120
 quarts of milk, you should produce a moderate amount, maybe a quart of urine per day. If

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:24.120
 most of your water intake appears in the form of urine, that means that you're not evaporating

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:32.120
 at a proper rate and so your metabolic rate is low. Your temperature should be kept right

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:41.120
 around 98.6 during the daytime, the pulse rate well above the 60s, preferably in the

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:55.120
 80s per minute. To do that might require supplementing some extra calcium, making sure you're getting

00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:08.120
 enough sodium in your diet. Having a vitamin D blood test is a good idea to make sure your

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:18.120
 blood level is up around 50 nanograms per milliliter. Vitamin D and thyroid work very

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:28.120
 closely together. The sodium and calcium work closely together to suppress the stress hormones

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:43.120
 and to activate the protective hormones such as DHEA and progesterone. You still have a

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:56.120
 tendency to what they call cellulite. For a quick remedy, supplementing progesterone

00:55:56.120 --> 00:56:11.120
 and DHEA, rubbing it into those areas and taking 5 or 10 milligrams orally can activate

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:24.120
 the connective tissue metabolism to toughen up the tone of the tissue and help it get

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:32.120
 rid of the water. I love that. Out of all of my time researching weight loss and fat

00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:37.120
 loss and cellulite and things like that for clients, I've never heard somebody say rub

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:41.120
 that into your skin. You're on the cutting edge. You're always coming up with things

00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:44.120
 that no one else is saying, which is what I really enjoy about you.

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:50.120
 That brings me to my last question. I wanted to ask you a question that was kind of personal,

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:55.120
 but I was hoping that it would be kind of a fun question for you to answer. What is

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:59.120
 your favorite pastime? What do you do for fun?

00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:05.120
 I think painting is my favorite thing.

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:10.120
 Yeah, I've seen some of your artwork online and it's really beautiful.

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:18.120
 Yeah, whenever I can get someone to sit for me, I like to paint portraits.

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:23.120
 Well, that's great. So that's what I call my vitamin P, pleasure, passion, purpose,

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:28.120
 and we have to get vitamin P as well as all these other vitamins. Wouldn't you agree?

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:39.120
 Yeah, definitely. It's really the key to the whole thing is to make it work pleasurably.

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:46.120
 Yeah, absolutely. Well, Dr. Peat, this has been so interesting and fun and I just really

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:51.120
 appreciate your time on all of these questions and I hope the listeners who submitted questions

00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:55.120
 do too. We're definitely going to have to do this again because I think people are really

00:57:55.120 --> 00:58:00.120
 going to benefit from all of the information, so I appreciate that. So we'll say bye for

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:04.120
 now. Any parting words you wanted to leave the listeners with?

00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:06.120
 Nope.

00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:11.120
 Okay. Well, make sure you check out Dr. Peat's newsletter and sign up for that. Go ahead

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:16.120
