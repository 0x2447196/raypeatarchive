 Nothing is more expensive than bad information. Know the source. One Radio Network dot com.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Well, good morning and welcome to the second part of our show as we're live here this morning on January 20th, 2020, on One Radio Network dot com.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 We're streaming live on YouTube and Facebook and on our website. And we have a YouTube channel now with all of the interviews that we're doing, so you can go there, Patrick Timpone.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 The link is top right of our website. And you can subscribe and like that and like things on Facebook. And that'll help to spread the word on what we're doing here.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 We're kind of moving things around with our new schedule. And so Dr. Peat now is going to be on the third Monday of the month, which is right now at 1030 Central Time, which is 830 on the far west coast where Dr. Peat is up in the northwest.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 He's very popular around the world and around here. He has his PhD at University of Oregon. He specialized in physiology, started his work on hormones in 1968, wrote his dissertation, which he outlined his ideas on progesterone and hormones closely related to it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 His main thesis is that energy and structure are independent at every level. Hmm. We should ask him about that right now. Dr. Peat is on the phone and he doesn't he's a he's a Luddite somewhat like we are and doesn't do the whole camera thing and all that.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 And so we just have his picture up there. But that's fine, too. Just being able to talk to him is worth it. Dr. Ray Peat. Good morning. Good morning. How's your life, sir? Oh, very interesting. Really?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 I had an interview yesterday about philosophy. Interesting change of subject, but basically everything interrelates, so it keeps things interesting.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Yeah. So maybe we can talk about that a little bit on the idea that your thesis that energy and structure are interdependent. It's almost a spiritual idea that spirit or chi or whatever creates all this is one kind of?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Yeah, it's going on all through the universe. The same things that generate energy and order in planets and galaxies and so on. Exactly the same thing is happening in our bodies. Energy flows and creates order.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 So as we allow the energy to flow more and more, we have more order in our life, in our body, in our health?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 Yep. Oxygen is receiving electrons. Sunlight puts electrons into the form of sugar. That's the source of all our energy is energized electrons from the sun in sugar.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 When we consume it, if we're really healthy, it goes all the way down to oxygen forming water. So the cycle is complete.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 But if we aren't healthy, then the sugar electron energy stops very near where it started and comes out as lactic acid. It's only half broken down, but it becomes toxic rather than constructive.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 When we burn the electrons all the way down to oxygen, a byproduct of the sugar is carbon dioxide. And the carbon dioxide is what keeps our structure finely tuned and adjusted, favoring that complete use of energy.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Wow, that's just so cool. So the lactic acid and the incomplete use of this sugar could be one of the reasons why sugar is blamed for cancer cells?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Exactly. When Warburg discovered that cancer produces a huge amount of lactic acid, even when it has oxygen and should be able to oxidize it all the way to carbon dioxide, people for 100 years now have been inattentive to what that means.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 There are still exercise physiologists and such who are claiming that lactic acid is a wonderful source of energy and such.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 But what Warburg started discovering was that it isn't just cancer producing lactic acid, but lactic acid itself produces cancer, keeps it going. It creates the energy block in other cells.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 So when the cancer cells turn glucose into lactic acid, the lactic acid circulating in the neighboring cells disturbs their energy, interferes, displaces the carbon dioxide and its metabolism.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 So the cancer spreads just by lactic acid to a great extent. Then it becomes systemic. The circulating lactic acid can be a test for cancer and general health if they just look at the amount of lactic acid in your blood.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 When it's circulating, it's putting all of your body under stress, shifting the electronic balance away from full oxidation, displacing carbon dioxide.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 And so we have sunlight, which works with it, the body, or the energy, which turns into kind of sugar, and somewhere along the line...

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 We finish turning it into carbon dioxide.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 That's in the perfect model. We turn it into carbon dioxide.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 And then what prohibits it from doing that and turns it into lactic acid is how we create disease by all the different ways we create it?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 Exactly, yeah. Just about anything that interferes. The idea of stress is extremely general. It can be too much activity or too little activity.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 If you're put in a cage so you can't move, the same physiology happens as if you were forced to run on a treadmill.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Same thing, too much or too little.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Yeah. When you're strapped down, for example, your serotonin increases, and the serotonin turns on that cancer metabolism or the stress metabolism.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 And if you're forced to run constantly, for example, the circulating lactic acid suppresses the active thyroid hormone and interferes with your ability to finish the oxidation to carbon dioxide.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 And so it leaves you in a stress condition.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 So the natural progression is to turn this sugar into carbon dioxide.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 And then why does the body like to have this carbon dioxide?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 People have looked at all kinds of organisms, single-cell organisms of various types, and there are a lot of simple organisms that don't need oxygen.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 They just need some form of energy.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 But it turns out that all of the simple organisms that have been tested, even though they might not need oxygen, they still need carbon dioxide.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 So it's really, in the whole picture of life, it's even more essential than oxygen, but most organisms have the oxygen and produce their own carbon dioxide.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 And so when we exercise, is there a way to retain more carbon dioxide?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Yeah, just the right amount of exercise.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 You don't want to overtrain.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 That's where the lactic acid starts melting you down, increasing cortisol and such, and lowering the constructive progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 The right amount of exercise increases those constructive steroid hormones and produces more carbon dioxide than at rest.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 So you're raising your body temperature by the right amount of exercise, and that increases the carbon dioxide.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 The carbon dioxide is binding to all of the cellular proteins and even changes the way the hormones interact on the cell proteins.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Many years ago, in explaining breathing, respiratory physiology, they always mentioned that a major way to transport carbon dioxide on the red blood cells is in the form of carbamino compounds,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 where the carbon dioxide sticks to an amino group on the hemoglobin molecule.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 It forms a compound.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 The acid and the base stick together instantly, and then reaching the lungs, where there's more oxygen, that compound decomposes.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 But strangely, only two or three people that I've found over the last 50 or 60 years have been interested in that interesting carbamino reaction.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 It happens not only in the red blood cells, but everywhere.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Everywhere there's a protein with an exposed amino group.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 That means the so-called hormone receptors are influenced, modified by the presence of carbon dioxide.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 So every place there is a protein, basically, the carbon dioxide is going to adjust the sensitivity to things such as hormones.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 These groups happen to be where oxidative damage happens.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 You've seen the so-called diabetic way of diagnosing red blood cells when they're getting glycated.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 Glycation happens in the brain in Alzheimer's disease, in the blood vessels, in aging in general.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 These so-called glycation compounds are sticking the same place the carbon dioxide should be.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 So if you have high carbon dioxide, any glycating compounds like breaking down sugar or unsaturated fats,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 these broken down oxidative particles just don't stick because the site is protected by carbon dioxide binding to it.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Just don't stick.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 So how, if you're just joining us, Dr. Ray Peat, and if you'd like to be on the show,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 you can email Patrick at OneRadioNetwork.com or 888-663-6386, January 20, 2020.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 You can put a question or comment on Facebook or YouTube.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 So knowing what you know about this, and very fascinating, I don't know if all of us were able to follow all of that,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 but I think we got a pretty interesting concept about the lactic acid and the carbon dioxide.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 How do you, for example, utilize this information, and you are what, Dr. Peat, you're 83?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 How do you work with that to help you stay healthy and stick around for a while?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 How does this information impact the way you live your life?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 I make sure that I take some thyroid to keep my body temperature up and my heart rate up.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 And every couple of years, I check my oxygen saturation.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 And if I'm at a high altitude, it's easier to get my oxygen saturation down to the level that is the safest.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 But just waking up in the morning, when I'm feeling best, my oxygen saturation will go down to 90 or 89 maybe.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 And if I'm under stress, my finger gadget that measures the oxygen, hemoglobin saturation, might go up to 98 or 99%.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 It isn't good to have your tissue saturated with oxygen because that's competing against the carbon dioxide.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 You should keep your oxygen and carbon dioxide in a good balance.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 So are you speaking of just this little finger thing you can get and put on, and you look at the saturation of oxygen?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 Now that's just, of course, opposite of what we're told. The higher number is the better.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 Yeah, but these finger gadgets really aren't. The person who invented the saturation instrument had a more complex way of doing it.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 And these things on your finger, if you put your finger in warm water, you'll tend to have a lower saturation.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 I've experimented putting my fingers in cold water, and it goes right up to 100% saturation.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 So if you're not using the oxygen, it'll simply show a high saturation in your extremities.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 You want to be using the oxygen and making carbon dioxide. So I think the average person ought to be around 93 to 95% saturation in general.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 With one of the little finger jobs. Is that what you use to test?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 Really? So again, when we're 98 or 99, it's telling us that we need to do what to get that down to 90. What would we do to move that down?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 Sometimes just relaxing and paying attention to how your body feels. And if you're just having a thought of things you have to do that can tend to make you hyperventilate.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 And just by being anxious and hyperventilating, you breathe so fast you're blowing out too much carbon dioxide.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 And all by itself, that will raise your lactic acid because carbon dioxide suppresses that wasteful use of sugar and protein.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 So you don't want to hyperventilate and taking thyroid makes you breathe harder, but it's doing it by producing more carbon dioxide, stimulating breathing.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 So the amount of oxygen you're moving isn't the question. It's how you're using that oxygen. And if you're using it efficiently, generally, you'll be in the middle to low 90s.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 Middle to low 90s. So if we are relaxing and learning how to breathe and taking 3, 4, 5 breaths a minute rather than 15.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 If your thyroid is active, you might be doing fine on 25 breaths a minute. It's all a matter of your metabolic rate.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 A low thyroid person breathing just a few times per minute can still be hyperventilating because they don't need the oxygen if they're very hypothyroid.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 And so breathing a normal amount will still be hyperventilating chemically for them.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 And your body temperature is still one of your main ways, Dr. Ray Peat, that you kind of look at the thyroid.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Yeah, yeah. The temperature. Just getting in a warm bath can solve a lot of things. If you're sure you're keeping the energy up, having some orange juice or milk and sugar or something to make sure you don't get low blood sugar,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 warming your body either by muscle activity or just by sitting in a warm bathtub will improve your metabolism, lower inflammation by getting the carbon dioxide produced.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Wow. Dr. Ray Peat is with us. Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com. So, the body temperature and the TSH and the other metrics we can get with a blood test, do they normally correlate together?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 Very often, the TSH, if it doesn't easily increase your thyroid secretion, the TSH keeps rising.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 And when it acts on other cells, the first thing it does is to excite the thyroid gland and that should produce T4 and T3, which keep the TSH down at a moderate level.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 But if the gland isn't responding with enough thyroid hormone production, then the TSH keeps rising and the TSH has an irritating, stimulating act on other cells, such as your blood vessels and bone marrow cells,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 and it will create a generalized inflammation so that hypertension, a lot of the circulatory problems are caused directly by too much TSH rather than by too little thyroid hormone.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 So, they go together, low thyroid hormone, high TSH, both of them contribute to the problem.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Dr. Peat, people listening around the world and if they're working with a doc and doing the natural thyroid, working with the TSH number, are they on pretty solid ground there, do you think?

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 No, I keep seeing people being diagnosed exclusively on the basis of their TSH.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 You have to look at the whole metabolism, how many calories they're eating.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 You can't be hyperthyroid and maintain your body weight on 1800 calories a day.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 I keep seeing that diagnosis and people treated for years with a thyroid suppressive drug when their metabolic rate is already too slow.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 Stress hormones will lower the TSH, so it looks like you're hypothyroid but you're really just under stress.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Looking at large populations and their natural level of thyroid stimulating hormone, one study found that people with 0.4 below the so-called normal range, from 0.01 up to 0.4,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 these people were free of thyroid cancer but as their TSH on average went up, so did the incidence of thyroid cancer.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 It's the same way that the gonadotropins, FSH for example, tend to drive ovarian cancer.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 If you remove an animal's one ovary, the FSH in the pituitary increases and overstimulates the remaining ovaries, so that one is more likely to develop cancer.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 Same with a testicle or an adrenal gland. If you remove one adrenal, the other one overworks and gets too much of the pituitary stimulating hormone and tends to develop a tumor.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Can you map out for our listeners what you would list as the bullet points so they can maybe have an idea and take some notes and listen to this and see how they can help to balance this thyroid without going down some black holes?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Do you have some bullet points you can put up there of things they should look at and change?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 I've seen a few people over the years who were on a raw vegetable diet, for example, eating lots of undercooked or raw broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and soybeans.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 They were developing multiple endocrine problems just by adding some eggs and milk to their diet.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 People who were told that their pituitary gland was hopelessly defective just by adding eggs and milk and orange juice, their pituitary function came back to normal.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 Besides those raw vegetables, probably the two most important things for damaging thyroid function are a protein deficiency.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 People sometimes get along for years eating only 20 or 25 grams of protein a day, but that just isn't enough to keep your energy running at the proper high rate.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 The other thing is the polyunsaturated fats, which even on the ideal diet, they will still tend to accumulate in the body over the years.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 But if you're eating lots of vegetables and nuts, seeds are generally rich in polyunsaturated fats, and fatty fish and poultry and pork, because of what those animals are generally fed,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 the polyunsaturated fats are efficient for making the animals gain weight because their thyroid is suppressed so that they retain more of the food they eat as fat.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 So if you eat fatty fish, poultry, pork, and the vegetables that are high in those polyunsaturated fats, you retain progressively.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 They inhibit the secretion of the thyroid hormone from the gland by blocking enzymes, and they interfere with the transport from the gland to your tissues.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 And then in the tissues, they block the actions of the thyroid hormone.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 And at the same time, these polyunsaturated fats are intensifying the actions of estrogen and actually stimulating the formation of estrogen.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 And the estrogen is a major inhibitor of the secretion of the thyroid hormone.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 So the polyunsaturated fats work complexly on your whole metabolic system.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 Ultimately, they tend to degrade the mitochondria that produce the carbon dioxide.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 Wow, what a trail that you've just, an image that you've just painted for us.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 So what are your favorite proteins if we want to get so many?

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 Do we have a number of so many grams of protein per body weight that is a good starting point?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 The National Academy of Science did a study for the Army, and they found that even medium-sized men and women at just desk work, just ordinary eight-hour-a-day activity, nothing very physical,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 needed at least 100 grams of protein a day to work efficiently.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 And they didn't specify the upper limit, but the minimum even for medium-sized women was about 100 grams per day.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 And the trouble is that the highest quality proteins are rich in methionine, cysteine, and tryptophan, and all of these happen to be potentially toxic amino acids.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Too much of them can cause seizures or inflammation, excitotoxic processes.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 So ideally, you would get more gelatin-like amino acids.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Gelatin happens to be deficient or to lack those toxic or excitatory amino acids, methionine, cysteine, and tryptophan.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 But fruits have a fair amount of amino acids, typically about 1% or milk is 3%.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 So milk happens to have some anti-stress factors, a variety of nutrients and proteins that counter the stress which the excitatory amino acids would promote.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 And the high calcium content of milk is the most important anti-stress factor.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 So gelatin is your favorite. That's the gelatin, you get Great Lakes gelatin, that gelatin?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 Yeah.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 It's one of your favorites for protein.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 For an old person, that's the best because it doesn't support tumor growth, for example.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 Oh, but for younger types, 20, 30, 40?

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 When you're growing up until 25 or so, you need the full protein like milk and cheese and eggs.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 And as the body goes around more revolutions around the sun, it can do well with just the gelatin?

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Yeah. Many years ago, nutritionists noticed that old people sometimes would live on maybe jello and toast or something that seemed completely impossible.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 But it happens that the gelatin is just about what the old person needs with just a very small amount of the tryptophan methionine to keep your hair growing and such.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 And if one wanted to do animal foods, what in your opinion, the literature shows that are some of the most preferable ones to have for protein?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 Yeah. All of the animal foods are very rich in those essential and growth-promoting amino acids.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 So, with age, to be safe from inflammation, you don't want to overdo the growth-promoting, especially if they're associated with polyunsaturated fats.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 So, then the fatty fish and you said pork and chicken, poultry, they tend to have more of the poofers because of what they're fed?

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 Yeah. Soybeans and corn, for example, have a very high proportion of unsaturated fats.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 And during the 1940s, it was discovered that those grains produced the best return on investment.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 A small amount of the fatty grains would produce the best weight production per dollar.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 Sure. But even now in the awareness that's out there, Dr. Peat, at farmers markets, you can find eggs from mostly grass-fed, but then when they do supplement, you can get organic feed with no soy, which sounds pretty good.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 But even those eggs can have more poofers than we want because there's corn in this feed? How can you find eggs that are worth eating?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 My friends in Mexico would feed their kitchen scraps to the chickens and there would be lots of meat scraps and lots of tortillas, leftover tortillas, which had the fat removed.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 Interesting.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 Their eggs were super. The taste is improved as the polyunsaturated fat content goes down. The cholesterol tends to increase and the taste is better.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 If you have noticed, supermarket eggs, sometimes they will say they're high in N-3, Omega-3 fatty acids. I've noticed that those have a very fishy taste.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Flax seed has been used as a chicken food supplement for those fatty acids, but I think people notice the fishy taste and tend to stay away from those just after they notice the taste.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 If one were going to have their own chickens and they were going to do supplemental feed, what would be an ideal if they don't have enough grass in the winter and such?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 Table scraps are very good. Bread or tortillas or cooked potatoes, all kinds of edible human food is very good for chickens.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 Very interesting. Dr. Ray Peat is with us. Stay right there, Dr. Peat.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 We're going to take a quick little break here. If you have a question, you can join us.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com. We appreciate your ongoing support.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Basically, if you are new here, what we do at One Radio Network is we're on the air every day.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 We're on the air now live Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with live streaming. We have all kinds of 3,000 hours of audio that you can check out.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 Then go to our YouTube channel and watch some of the shows and like them.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 We have a lot of things here for you on One Radio Network.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 The way we support ourselves is if you look at the right side of our page, there are some really beautiful, nice little ads and some great products.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 If you see something there that kind of tweaks you and makes you look kind of, "Wow, I want to try some of that," we have some very, very nice people.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 Good people, Ken Rolla, Brandon Amalani, our sulfur. We got some sales on pine pollen going on right now through Tuesday.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 You can check this out. Listen.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 We're talking with health motivator Daniel Vitalis about testosterone and pine pollen.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 Some of the guys have asked if taking pine pollen would dampen their own testosterone production.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 That's something that can happen with the steroidal forms of isolated bioidentical testosterone.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 That's one of the issues bodybuilders who are taking steroids often have.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 What I want to point out about pine pollen is that it's a whole food.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 The amount of testosterone that's present is very rarified.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 These aren't really issues that we experience when we take the whole food form of pine pollen or a tincture of pine pollen,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 but it is an issue if people are taking synthetic testosterone.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 Pine pollen. It's a whole food. It's real. And it works. For you girls, too.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 Click and order on any of the Sir Thrival links.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:31.000

 If you look at that page today, Monday, or tomorrow, I believe it's through midnight,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 you'll see some really nice savings on pine pollen gold, colostrum, 6 ounces, and elk antler velvet gold.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 You've got the prices right there for you. Pretty cool.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:01.000

 So that's a cool thing as well.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 So this sale, check it out on Sir Thrival for the next 48 hours or so.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 We're doing some very interesting experimenting.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 We had a great study that was presented by Dr. Mark Circus on hydrogen.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 This was a case study that was released about a month ago.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 We have that case study on the last show with Dr. Mark Circus on the show page,

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 where metastasis in the lungs were completely healed out and cured.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 I don't like to use the C word because we don't claim that, with hydrogen, breathing hydrogen gas.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 And you can look at that. I mean, wow, pretty interesting.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 And here's some information on it, why it might be a good investment for you.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 Many people have said, and we concur, that the number one investment we should make is in our health.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 Here's George Wiseman.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 Last caller, I'm sorry, I didn't remember his name, said an investment.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 And this is really the investment kind of thing that you need to do.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 Not my machine specifically. I think I sell the world's best machine,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 and I do my best to maintain it and support the customers and everything.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 But regardless of who you get it from, you really should invest in your health.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 How are you going to enjoy life if you haven't got health?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 How are you going to fulfill that bucket list?

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 So number one on the bucket list should be your health, and then you get some extra years.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 I say this thing not only adds years to your life, because the science is showing a 30 to 50% life extension.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 So I'm expecting to go to the 120, 150 years old, and help a lot of people between now and then.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 But it also adds life to your years.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 There's no sense living your last decade of life if you're in a hospital bed attached to machines, you know what I mean?

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 Throwing a Frisbee and having fun.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 It's so true, isn't it?

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 Boy, if we don't feel good and have the energy to do what we need to do, I mean, what's the point?

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 And here's an investment with a lifetime warranty and also a one-year, no questions asked, money back guarantee if you don't want it.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 Check out this Aquacure machine, bubbling hydrogen gas, drinking it, breathing it.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 This is real cutting-edge technology.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 Check it out in our store. Use promo code 1RADIO for a 10% discount.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 The Aquacure Browns Gas Machine, on RadioNetwork.com.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 And I am not sure exactly how this hydrogen worked on this metastasis lung things, I mean.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 And we've reached out to the people that did this case study with this one woman and wrote about it.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 And we're trying to get them on the air, and we'll see if we can make that happen.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 So stay tuned with that.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 We are listener supported. One Radio Network.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 With Dr. Ray Peat, and he's going to be here now.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 And we thank you, Dr. Peat, for taking time out.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 He's going to be with us once a month on the third Monday of the month at about 1030 Central Time.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 And then you can then also check out his website, RayPeat.com.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 Sign up for his newsletter. Very affordable. And it comes out every couple months.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 And what do you just write? Something different every few months about what you're thinking about on your newsletter, Dr. Peat?

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 Yeah, the current one is on the history and mechanism of vaccination.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 And that relates to many of the things I've been working on, how the immune system works,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 and what the mechanism of most of the vaccines is creating a local inflammation at the site of injection.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 They use not only aluminum as an irritant, but many other antigens are in the average vaccine that cause a local inflammation.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 But that local inflammation leads to delivery of these same irritants to the brain and the reproductive organs, causing chronic symptoms in a large proportion of the people.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 It's admitted that 10 to 15 percent of the people will have maybe a few days of fever from the inflammation.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 But they're still recommending that pregnant women get two vaccines, both of which contain aluminum.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 And it's generally recognized that inflammation during pregnancy, no matter what is the cause,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 inflammation during pregnancy changes the way the fetus's brain is developing.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 So the official authorities have acknowledged all of the brain-changing effects of the vaccines, but still they say the vaccines are harmless.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 You must take them.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 So this newsletter...

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 Is all about that.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 It's opening up a lot of themes that I'll be writing about more in the future.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 So we've read also and been told by Dr. Cowan that the vaccines, they disrupt this, what he calls the innate immune system, right?

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 The body's immune system?

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 Yeah. When I was in graduate school, we had an international immunology conference and the big shots from all around the world came and did their presentation.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 And at that time, the innate immune system was considered a primitive thing, irrelevant.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 These people were talking about the structure and function of the antibodies.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 That line of thinking was continuous from the time of Paul Ehrlich and his magic bullet.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 The antibodies were still being thought of as extensions of Paul Ehrlich's magic bullet.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 But Ehrlich shared the Nobel Prize with Metchnikoff, who was an embryologist who showed the immune function as part of the whole developmental process of the organism, a holistic view.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 And in the 1960s, this was put aside as a primitive, somewhat irrelevant form of immunity.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 But now it's coming out that the antibody system is kind of a desperate last measure of immunity.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 It's promoted by estrogen and the stress hormones.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 Meanwhile, the innate immune system actually does learn and is an adaptive immune system.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 But the antibody people were saying that the antibody system is the adaptive part and the innate system is merely a primitive forerunner of this fancy system.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 So the innate immune system would be a child goes out, or a dog, or whatever, and gets exposed to something and the body just kind of figures out, kind of learns how to work with it and gets stronger because of it.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 Yeah, and the natural exposure to irritants and infections is through the skin or the lungs or the digestive system or even the eye membranes, but definitely not through the muscle where you inject something into the muscle.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 It's an absolutely different process.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 So the innate immune system in theory would then keep getting stronger and more intelligent as more substances were exposed to the organism, the human, the mammals, the people.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 Yeah, and also in the 1960s, plants were demonstrated to have a learning immune system.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 So the evidence was that the immune system, even in plants, is intelligent and adaptive.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 Almost an argument for organic where the less you mess around with it, if possible, the more it's going to figure out what to do.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 Yeah, there have been studies in several countries. India has done a lot of it, showing that vitamin A can reduce infectious disease on a level comparable to vaccines.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 And vitamin D is the other essential immune-supporting nutrient.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 Very few studies have combined vitamin A and D and generally good nutrition.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 The idea is how to keep infections spreading from poor countries.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 And vitamin A doesn't cost very much, so they reduce the focus of infection by giving people partial nutrition.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 But if you simply gave everyone good nutrition, you wouldn't have epidemics.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 So we kind of understand the innate immune system.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 So when you give a vaccine with the adjuvants like aluminum and such, talk us through how this antibody theory is supposed to work.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 It's a very complicated course.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 You have cells that catch the antigen and process it and communicate it to the cells,

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 which supposedly it's a cell that has already mutated to be able to match that antigen.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 And that one cell multiplies as a clone called the clonal selection theory.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 And that one antibody's descendants produces a flood of these specific antibodies that then persist in the body sometimes for the whole lifetime.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 And that's supposed to be a process that promotes the vaccines to make the body immune from whatever measles, mumps and stuff.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 Yeah, and I got interested in the fact that estrogen promotes the B cells which produce the antibodies,

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 where progesterone supports the thymus gland and the T cells which have the intelligent adaptability and multiple levels of interacting with bad factors.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 And it happens that estrogen promotes autoimmunity. Women have five or ten times the incidence of autoimmune diseases as men because of this influence of estrogen.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 And the fact that the vaccines are working exclusively on that system shouldn't be surprising that autoimmune diseases are the fastest growing malady in the population.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 I think it's not only the estrogenic substances but the vaccines which work in exactly the same way that estrogen stress does.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:30.000
 Dr. Ray Peters with us January 20. Dr. Peters, you probably know there's more and more talk about adults being forced, if you will, to perhaps get some vaccines moving forward with all these.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 I just saw two where they're actually checking people coming now in from China, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston and New York.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 I mean, you can see the kind of paradigm being built to wanting to protect us from all these outside sources.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 I wonder if a 40 or 50 year old would take some vaccines because many people conjecture that you won't be able to fly unless you're up on your vaccines and we think that's possibly coming.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 How it affects an adult, a 50 year old, as compared to a six year old?

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 That should have been studied in aging animals. If you look at the actual investigations of how vaccines work and how they work on different individuals, females versus males, old versus young, those studies just haven't been done.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 They don't care. In 1986, the government passed a law saying that the drug companies would have no liability at all for any harm done by the vaccines.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 And the Department of Health Human Services pledged at the time that they would check and work with the drug companies to improve the safety of the vaccines and would report every two years.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:35.000
 But 30 years later, a lawsuit when Freedom of Information didn't get the information, they sued them. And finally, the secretary of HHS admitted that they had done absolutely nothing over those 30 years.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 And when you look at these studies, the pressure is put on the journals so that critical articles have been retracted and denounced as fraudulent just because they were criticizing the dangers of the vaccines.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 But many of the studies supposedly testing the safety of the vaccines used as a control the whole vaccine minus one antigen.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 And the control contained the most toxic understood part of the vaccine, the adjuvants. And so they were comparing a known toxin against the vaccine and saying the vaccine wasn't much more toxic than the toxic components.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:49.000
 So it's a completely crazy, crooked way to do science. But those articles, no one has pressured them to be withdrawn, even though they're essentially fraudulent.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 My goodness. My goodness.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 So your latest newsletter is all about this on rayPeate.com, right? Dr. Peate.com.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 Fascinating. Here's an email for you. Hello to both of you. You're just great. Thank you. Two questions. Are thyroid nodules reversible? And do you know a good source for desiccated thyroid?

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 No, I've looked into many, many over the years. When the Armour product was sold to a different company, the recipe was changed and completely different things are put into it now.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 And for at least the first 20 or 30 years, they were removing the thyroid calcitonin hormone and selling it separately. So I stopped using the glandular.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 I happen to have some of the powdered pure gland from a chemical company that I trust, but I don't know of any well-defined reliable glandular product now.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 So today you cannot recommend one reliable glandular product out there in the market. I mean, if you had to choose one, which one would you go with for our listeners if they don't have a choice?

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 I've heard the fewest bad things about WP and Nature Throid.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 WP, is that a brand?

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 Yeah.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000
 And Nature Throid. You've heard the fewest issues about it?

00:56:43.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 Yeah, but I haven't used them personally, so I'm not sure. I use a synthetic that was designed to be exactly equivalent to the old Armour thyroid product 40 years ago.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 It's called CINO+. It's a mixture of T4 and T3 in the same ratio that the old Armour had.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 Oh, CINO+. And is that available in the United States? I know you gave us a source in Mexico where you can get that.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 That's the only place I know of.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:25.000
 Yeah. Do we know that website? I used to have that. People are going to ask, I know.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 PharmaciaDelNino.MX

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:37.000
 Yeah, Pharmacia. Yeah, we'll put that on there. So it's CINO+ S-C-N-O-P-L-U-S?

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000
 C-Y-N-O, like CINO+.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:47.000
 CINO+. And that's got T3 and T4, and that's one of the cleanest forms, or it's a synthetic?

00:57:47.000 --> 00:58:00.000
 Yeah. And the tablets are equivalent to more than two grains of the old Armour, so you want to start with about an eighth of a tablet or a fourth of a tablet.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 Didn't they come in a powder too, if I recall? No?

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 Not that I know of.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 Yeah. So you'd have to be careful about your dosage on that one, because it's pretty big, right? 120, right?

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:18.000
 It's equivalent to, I think, about 130 or 140 milligrams of Armour.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 Wow. Yeah, CINO+. And this lady wanted to know about thyroid nodules reversible.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 Oh, yeah. I've known basically everyone who supplements the right thyroid. One person was supplementing only T4, which is a very conventional thing to do because it doesn't give you the metabolic effect of the T3, but it does have a full thyroid suppressive effect.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:09.000
 But one person who wasn't having the nodules shrink after three months of a full supplement of T4 added T3, and within just, I think it was about three weeks, the nodules had shrunk.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:18.000
 Ah, excellent. Sanna writes in, "Dr. Peat's current opinion on melatonin, please."

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:46.000
 Oh, I've been following the research for many years, and one of the problems is that the body produces a fraction of a milligram, and so even a one milligram dose, which people use for improving their sleep, that's already unphysiological.

00:59:46.000 --> 01:00:04.000
 But if someone takes five or 10 milligrams, then that's really getting risky, I think. There have been studies, for example, most animals, both in the lab and in the wild, their gonads regress during the winter.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:28.000
 They don't want to reproduce in the winter, and why that is is that melatonin rises in proportion to darkness. The days are short in the winter, and so melatonin rises to a higher level, and it causes regression of the gonads and also of the thymus.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:36.000
 So, if one's going to mess with melatonin supplementally, you're talking about really very, very small doses.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000
 A tenth to a fourth of a milligram.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:51.000
 A tenth to a fourth of a milligram. Wow. Any specific advice on constant stomach noises, tummies making noises?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
 Oh, I think that's good.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
 Yeah, it seems like it, doesn't it? Yes.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:20.000
 A person sometimes using a stethoscope so they can hear what their intestine is doing can improve, it's a way of meditating to improve relaxation, because if you're anxious, things go quiet, and as soon as you relax and are having fun, your intestine gets lively.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:43.000
 Yes, yeah. I've experimented with that when I was going through this heartburn thing late at night and relaxing, relaxing, not breathing hardly, you know, just retaining carbon dioxide, and the more and more I did it, and really got really chilled out, if you will, I could just hear the stomach, you know, doing its thing and taking care of any pressure or any burning kind of thing.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:53.000
 So that's the way it works, isn't it? The more we relax, and so the tummy wants to make those kind of noises, that's what it's doing, it's doing its job.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
 Yeah.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
 Yeah.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000
 If you have gas, naturally it will retinate more.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:27.000
 Yeah. Anna writes in, "I've got a terrible sinus issue that makes me extremely tired. It's triggered by cold, usually cold wind, ice cream. I take progesterone, B3, and thyroid, and antibiotics, but none of them help. I follow Dr. Peat's diet recommendation. My pulse and temperature seem fine. Is there anything else that I could do? Am I missing something here?"

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:49.000
 Sometimes it's the lack of a carrot salad. Carrots are antiseptic and anti-inflammatory and stimulate the intestine while binding the toxins such as estrogen secreted in the bile, preventing reabsorption.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:03:17.000
 So just having a good-sized carrot salad every day can shift your hormones significantly, reducing such things as sinus inflammation, but also infertile women have become fertile by shifting the balance away from estrogen and the stress hormones and increasing progesterone.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
 Now that's one of the few kind of raw vegetables you really like often, right, carrots?

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:41.000
 Yeah, because it's almost completely indigestible and even bacteria are suppressed by it. It doesn't support bacterial or fungal growth in the intestine. So it's like an antibiotic broom that sweeps you clean.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:04:01.000
 Mark writes in, "I have half of a thyroid gland left after they took the left side. I am currently on Synthroid and I'm wondering if the other side of the thyroid is sufficient enough to make enough of the other hormones." Could Dr. Peat give me some ideas on this?

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:17.000
 Yeah, it generally regrows and is adequate, but the T4 will tend to keep it suppressed and that's okay if your liver is able to turn the T4 to T3.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:40.000
 The reason the glandular or the balanced thyroid supplement is better is that so many people have poor liver efficiency and you have to have your blood sugar steady to convert thyroxine T4 into the active T3 hormone.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:05:05.000
 And if you do everything right, the right amount of activity and balanced nutrients, then your liver will be able to turn T4 to T3. Women are many times more likely than men to have a problem with just T4.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:22.000
 Cody writes in, "Considering that one were following Dr. Peat's information and living a long and healthy life as possible, how long does he think one can be expected to live following these ideas?"

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:35.000
 I think the most important thing is the accumulation of the polyunsaturated fats which block your ability to respond to thyroid hormone.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:58.000
 And so if there's some way to minimize the intake and activate the process of elimination, I think it should be able to go on indefinitely. That's the basic motor of aging, I think.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
 Our proof is polyunsaturated fatty acids.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
 Yeah.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
 Wow.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
 Now PUFAs are in, there are nuts too?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:20.000
 Yeah, except macadamia. I think even Brazil nuts have a fair amount of PUFA. Macadamia nuts are pretty low.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
 Are they the lowest that you know of, macadamia?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
 The lowest I know of.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:34.000
 So in your opinion then, if you go with the PUFA concept, nuts are not a good idea.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:55.000
 Yeah, that's why I've emphasized sugar and other carbohydrates to reduce the fat intake, even though butter and coconut oil are mostly safe. They still have 2 or 3% of the toxic fats.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:05.000
 And so you can minimize your intake of those if you increase starch and sugar.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
 Starch and sugar, and how would they be increased? What kind of foods?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:27.000
 Orange juice, tropical fruits in general, the sweet ones rather than the starchy, and all of the nixtamalized grains such as tortillas, tamales, and so on.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:52.000
 Ancient cultures in Asia as well as the Americas discovered the technique of cooking grains in lime ashes or limestone, cal is what they call it in Spanish.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:08:08.000
 And so that's why you could recommend corn in the tortillas and the tamales because of the process, but we don't really have access to that unless we go through that ourselves, do we?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:31.000
 Yeah, it's easy to make if you get organic corn and boil it with the alkali. It swells up, makes hominy. You throw away the water because the alkali has turned the fat into soap and you throw the soapy water away.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:57.000
 And then the corn has been partly digested by the alkali so that the protein changes composition, produces some niacin, increasing the nutritional quality of the protein and partly digesting the carbohydrates so it's less likely to form gas and feed bacteria.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.000
 Do you have specific directions on your website of how to do that?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:08.000
 No, but you can find it anywhere on the internet, nixtamalized corn.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
 What's the name of it? Nixtamalized?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
 Yeah, N-I-X-T-A-M-A-L-I-Z-E.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
 So you probably watch a YouTube video, they probably show you how to do that, right?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
 Yeah.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:37.000
 Thank you for having Dr. Peat on regularly on One Radio Network. He's greatly helped me with my family. I'd appreciate if you would ask him a couple of questions. One is, I would like to know if Dr. Peat ever eats bread?

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:54.000
 About 45 years ago, 50 years ago, I made bread regularly, soaking the flour for about 12 hours until the gluten was essentially gone.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:11.000
 And so it wouldn't leaven normally, and so I would make up a batter basically with powdered milk and the gluten and starch were turned to sugar.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:27.000
 It didn't have any of the rubbery quality of gluten that makes bread rise, so I would make a wet batter and then bake it at a high temperature so it would boil and leaven itself by the steam.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:52.000
 And it made a very delicious, non-toxic bread because the long soaking, 12 hours, would convert the harmful proteins to valuable, nutritious proteins and the gluten was essentially zero.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
 So you would actually soak the wheat berries?

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
 No, I would grind it first and then soak the…

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.000
 And soak them, wow. But you don't eat it now, bread?

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
 Not for 40 years.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:17.000
 Not for 40 years. Has Dr. Peat ever married or had any children, and if so, do they follow his work?

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
 No.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000
 No, no above, huh?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:42.000
 If getting cold does negative things, how does cryotherapy work differently? If getting cold can do negative things to the body, you've heard of this cryotherapy, people are doing this very super cold, they jump in these tubes.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:53.000
 Yeah, it can increase your metabolic rate if your thyroid responds properly.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:18.000
 I was interested in the link that Dr. Peat made between hypoglycemia and lactic acid. I've had some issues with hypoglycemia that I believe with diet changes, but now I've been diagnosed with HCM and AFib that are exacerbated by lactic acid buildup. Is there a link between hypoglycemia and cardiovascular disease?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:47.000
 Oh yeah, your adrenaline and histamine and serotonin, everything, the emergency signals rise. Hypoglycemia and oxygen deficiency are almost identical in the harm they do, and they bring up inflammatory stress hormones and cause things such as nerve muscle pain.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:55.000
 Nerve muscle malfunctions, heart rhythm problems, inflammation in the heart, kidneys, everywhere.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:15.000
 The basic reason for hypoglycemia is that it isn't being oxidized fully and instead it's turning to lactic acid. Lactic acid shifts the electron balance, leads to inflammation and fibrosis.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:36.000
 The rhythm problems are indicating that inflammation and fibrosis are going to develop, so it's very important to get your sugar stable so that the energy is supplied regularly without inflammation.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:48.000
 Thyroid is the basic thing to make the sugar oxidized to the stabilizing carbon dioxide without lactic acid.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:14:04.000
 Just breathing carbon dioxide in an emergency, like breathing in a bag, you've probably heard of that. You re-breathe for a couple of minutes and the carbon dioxide accumulates in the bag and just re-breathes.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:20.000
 As the oxygen goes down, the CO2 rises, and that will lower the stress, anxiety, arrhythmia signals, tending to suppress the lactic acid.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:34.000
 I've known people who were having high blood pressure who in one day brought their blood pressure down to normal by many episodes of re-breathing in a paper bag.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:47.000
 Did I mention previously a book from about, I think it was 1905, 1908, somewhere in there, called "The Medical Uses of Carbonic Acid"?

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000
 Yes, we should mention that, "The Medical Uses of Carbonic Acid."

01:14:52.000 --> 01:15:13.000
 I don't remember the author's name, but you can find it. It has a good section on treatments starting from, I think, 1790 through the 19th century, treating cancer with putting pure carbon dioxide gas in contact with a tumor.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:23.000
 Wow. In general, as we relax more and don't breathe as much, we obtain more carbon dioxide, right?

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:51.000
 Yeah, unless things are fairly bad. It really helps to have a thyroid T3 supplement and something like orange juice and milk to support the system within ideal chemical environments to help you relax and get your own CO2 and T3 production going.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000
 And milk and orange juice does that, two of the things.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:05.000
 Yeah. A milkshake or ice cream or marshmallows, anything in an emergency can help you break a cycle.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:25.000
 When you've been under stress for a while, your glycogen stores in the body are depleted. We store almost, the typical person, about half a pound of sugar is stored in our muscles and brain and other tissues.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:42.000
 And once those are depleted, if you only eat, say, half a pound of sugar or carbohydrates in a day, you're going to be using most of that and might not be storing enough.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:17:00.000
 So the amount of sugar or other carbohydrates that you need to replenish those stores, it's kind of amazing how much it takes if you make sure that your thyroid is okay.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:22.000
 Then eating ice cream and marshmallows and so on, you can see the change in your blood pressure. I've experienced stress that depleted my glycogen so that I had maybe 160 blood pressure over 90, something like that.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:38.000
 And by eating as much sugar as I could get in along with other foods, I could bring those numbers together to a 40-point spread instead of a 70 or 80-point spread.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
 And that's preferable.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:47.000
 Yeah. Your blood is circulating efficiently when the spread is reduced.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
 With sugar?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:18:00.000
 Yeah, or starch to get your carbohydrate more than you're burning, then you can store it as glycogen.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
 Like a potato.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:21.000
 Yeah, it would take pounds and pounds of potatoes to replace once you get depleted. But if you're aware of, if you're checking your blood pressure frequently, you can see the pulse pressure, the difference between top and bottom.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:30.000
 You can see it decreasing as you make headway of getting your glycogen stores back up so that your T3 is working.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us January 20th, Patrick Timpone.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:49.000
 Kate writes in, "I've read where people that consume just a little bit of alcohol per day actually are longer lived than people who don't consume any."

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
 What does Dr. Peat think about just a little bit of wine?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:19:05.000
 Yeah, in some physics labs, they've found that ethanol at a very small amount is a very powerful antioxidant.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:24.000
 And some biological experiments, they found that age pigment was regressed from brain cells with vitamin E. And in their control, they found that the vitamin E contained ethanol.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.000
 And as a control, they did just ethanol and found that it regressed the age pigment.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:37.000
 But the amount it takes to do that is on the order of maybe a teaspoonful of alcohol per day.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:46.000
 From one to five cc's of alcohol is enough for that antioxidant.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:55.000
 So maybe a teaspoon or a tablespoon of whatever, agave tequila or something, could be beneficial.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
 I think so.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:04.000
 Loretta writes in, she's on Facebook, hi Loretta, "What does Dr. Peat think about protein shakes for meal replacements?"

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:21.000
 If they're made with a powdered protein, the process of powdering it exposes the particles to oxygen unless it's ground under nitrogen gas and so on.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:33.000
 You just can't get a powdered protein that is, well gelatin contains none of the oxidizable, easily oxidizable amino acids.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.000
 So powdered gelatin is okay for a supplement in a drink.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:46.000
 Loretta, what Dr. Peat is talking about, you can look up Great Lakes gelatin and it's grass fed, I think moo cows.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:54.000
 You like that as one of your best sources of some kind of protein, right? Better than whey or whatever.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:02.000
 Yeah, because when you concentrate and dehydrate the proteins containing cysteine and tryptophan,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000
 they are very susceptible to being oxidized into toxins.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
 Here's one for you, this is kind of interesting.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:21.000
 Lorenzo wants to know, "What's the difference between cow milk and goat milk? I seem to do better on goat milk.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:28.000
 Is that giving me all the goodness that you talk about with drinking milk?"

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:44.000
 Sure, it's got all of the nutrients, it's rich in some nutrients and the cream particles are different.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:53.000
 For a lot of people it's easier to digest because of just the consistency of the cream particles.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000
 But it does tend to have a little more of the minerals.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.000
 But partly it depends on what the cows are fed.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:13.000
 If the cows have a good grass diet mostly, their milk is very digestible and safe.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:19.000
 Goats eat a lot of stuff, don't they? They eat a lot of everything, don't they, goats?

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000
 Yeah, you have to make sure they don't eat junk.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:29.000
 Here's an email for you, "How toxic is fluoride and what instruments..."

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:35.000
 Oh, he wants to know. Okay, "How toxic is fluoride?" is the first question.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:45.000
 It's very toxic and it tends to accumulate in your bones and teeth.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:52.000
 When it's bound in a crystal, it isn't actively toxic.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:57.000
 But in the process of getting there, there were studies.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:08.000
 Yamianas and Dean Burke did a study showing a correlation between fluoridated water and cancer.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:16.000
 And that has been intentionally denied by the fluoridation authorities.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:24.000
 But animal experiments show that it has toxins including carcinogenesis.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:29.000
 So just a little bit, you just don't want to put it in your body, right?

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
 Yeah.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
 Do you play any instruments?

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
 Yeah, cello is my favorite.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
 Cello?

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:46.000
 I bought a very nice one for $300 in...

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:54.000
 Paratro is the town in Mexico that makes them.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:01.000
 Do you know about CRISPR gene editing? C-R-I-S-P-R gene editing.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:09.000
 Yeah, the whole idea of working on people's genes.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:22.000
 No gene engineer is going to be as competent at engineering the genes as our cells are.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:32.000
 A bacterium is constantly editing and revising its genes according to situations.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000
 If bacteria can do it, we can do it.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:47.000
 But when you try to do it in a test tube, it's always lacking information that the whole body has.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:25:00.000
 The whole body evaluates the situation of our chromosomes and can modify them accordingly with various epigenetic mechanisms.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:13.000
 But the genetic engineers are missing almost all of the actual mechanism that produces appropriate changes.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:27.000
 I think it's becoming more and more interesting to think about the possibility that we are manipulating and changing all of this with our state of consciousness about what we think and believe.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:35.000
 Yeah, we're continuously interacting with the environment.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000
 When we talk, we're modifying each other's brains.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:51.000
 The whole organism changes in the process of talking and listening and understanding.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:26:04.000
 Those changes, ordinarily, don't cause drastic changes, but in bad situations, it can be the decisive factor.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:20.000
 So it's not a stretch to think about the idea that if people would sit and watch TV and news, that energy, these words or whatever is involved in it, is going into the body.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:39.000
 Yeah, when I had TV 20 years ago, I was watching some Supreme Court judges talking and I took my blood pressure and it had gone up to 168 over 110.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.000
 I could tell that their thoughts were harming me.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:52.000
 Yeah, wow. Here's an email or a question on YouTube, watching on YouTube from Splizzy.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.000
 What does Dr. Peat think about molecular hydrogen and its research so far?

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:06.000
 Seems to fall under Peat's paradigm of regenerative versus degenerative metabolism, favoring the regenerative side of things.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:23.000
 Yeah, we have enzymes called dehydrogenases, which can, in principle, use hydrogen instead of glucose or other molecules.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:37.000
 The NADH molecule that transmits energy from glucose or protein to be producing energy.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:59.000
 I think a hydrogen molecule can be handled by the enzymes that handle NADH and transmit hydrogen electronic energy into the electron transport chain to produce carbon dioxide or produce water.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:12.000
 You wouldn't be getting your carbon dioxide if you relied too much on hydrogen, but producing energy, I think it can be constructive.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:20.000
 Did you hear that case study we talked about with the metastasis and using molecular hydrogen? It was fascinating. Wow.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
 Yeah.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
 Can you understand how that could possibly work?

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:43.000
 Yeah, by reducing inflammation, I think. Inflammation is an imbalance of electrons, and sometimes just not having enough energy is a problem.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:56.000
 If you cut off your oxygen or glucose supply, you go into that stressed condition that produces dangerous electrons.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:02.000
 Glucose or hydrogen, I think, can often solve the problem.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
 Interesting. What does Dr. Peat think of taking cold showers?

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:15.000
 Also, I tend to have cold hands in the morning, but they warm up towards the evening. What could this be related to, or does it say anything about my body?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:23.000
 Cold showers in general, do you think the body likes to get cold and get stronger that way, this whole cold idea?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:35.000
 If your thyroid function is low, you should check your waking temperature and pulse rate as well as your midday temperature and pulse rate.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:46.000
 If your metabolic energy is low, getting cold can slow things down even more and put you over into the inflammatory state.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:59.000
 When your feet, for example, are around 90 degrees Fahrenheit, they start producing inflammatory signals that affect the rest of your body.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:08.000
 So your hands and feet are the quickest to get cold when your metabolic energy is low.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:14.000
 A cold bath in that situation just can make things worse.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:28.000
 So, the body temperature and the pulse rate, what would be a sign, then, in general, of a balanced metabolism going on in the morning?

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:37.000
 I'm waking up with, say, a 98 degree temperature and 70 beats per minute.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:45.000
 So, that 98 to 98.6, you're not too picky about getting all the way to the .6?

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:52.000
 By about 11 in the morning, it should rise about half a degree from the waking temperature.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:00.000
 And if it would not, if it would stay the same, say 98 throughout the day, you would want to maybe look at maybe a little thyroid?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:15.000
 Yeah, check the situation changes. If your night is very stressful, some people will wake up with a 98.6 temperature and 75 beats per minute heart rate.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:29.000
 And then after they start having orange juice and milk and sunlight, their temperature will go down to maybe 97 and a 60 beat per minute.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:37.000
 Because the nighttime stress can give you artificially increased metabolism at waking.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:47.000
 So, it's important to look at the change. It should rise, your metabolic rate should rise after breakfast and stay there until sunset.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:32:01.000
 What does Dr. Peate think about this fad or fashion that's being talked about, intermittent fasting, where people just eat four hours in the afternoon, say, from noon until 4 p.m., and they don't eat again until noon the next day?

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:06.000
 Could this possibly be beneficial for the body?

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000
 No, I don't think it's.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
 No, you don't see much.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:28.000
 The studies on mice, I don't think are applicable. It's important to look at the right species and the right combination of foods and the timing.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:36.000
 And it depends on the age and so on.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:43.000
 If you don't have a very high metabolic rate, one meal a day might be okay.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:51.000
 But with a very high metabolic rate, going 20 hours without food can bring on stress.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:58.000
 Here's one for you. If you put boiling water in powdered gelatin, does that damage the proteins in any way?

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
 No, they're very stable.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:07.000
 Really? So, you could actually put this Great Lakes gelatin in a hot drink, if you would, or put it in something like that?

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
 Yeah.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:25.000
 Wow. Can Dr. Peat share some specific remedies that people can use to break out of chronic inflammatory patterns, such as stress-induced aerobic glycosis?

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:36.000
 Yeah, thyroid and orange juice and milk are the quickest ways.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
 Orange juice, milk, and what was the other one?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
 Thyroid.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
 Thyroid.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000
 Thyroid, T3 supplement in particular.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:53.000
 I think I misunderstood when I asked you about if you were on a desert island, what you would take with you.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:01.000
 Would you say again what you would take with you if you only could do a few foods? I want to make sure I got it right.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
 I don't remember.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:08.000
 You don't remember what you said. I think it was orange juice and tortillas and...

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
 Cheese, maybe.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
 Cheese, maybe. Yeah.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:21.000
 You think there's a big difference between organic raw cheese and just cheese?

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:32.000
 Yeah, they're now manufacturing cheese with engineered microbes and things that you just don't want to expose yourself to.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:39.000
 Yeah, yeah. Raw cheese, you think easier to digest than the pasteurized?

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:50.000
 Well, pasteurization doesn't necessarily hurt it, but it's the additives that I think should be avoided.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.000
 Final question for you, then we'll let you go back to work.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:01.000
 This is a very profound question. What does Dr. Ray P think about eating peanut butter?

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:17.000
 Years ago, they were finding that I think it was about 30% of the peanut butter samples they tested contained a very toxic fungal metabolite.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:22.000
 And just that risk, I think, is enough reason to avoid it.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000
 That could be why so many people are allergic to peanuts, I guess.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000
 What is the anaphylaxis? There was something there, whatever it is.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
 Yeah, I think aflatoxin.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
 Aflatoxin, yeah.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:42.000
 And I guess there's no reason to believe that an organic peanut is really organic these days with drift, and we just don't know, do we?

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.000
 Well, even organic things can have fungus growing on them.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
 Oh, it's the fungus in the peanut. Yeah.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.000
 Cool. Well, Dr. Peat, again, thank you for being here. We had a good time.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:02.000
 Again, tell folks your latest newsletter that they can get at drpete.com is all about vaccines.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
 Yeah, History of Vaccinations.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000
 History of Vaccinations.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
 All right, sir, it's an honor to talk to you.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.000
 You're doing good. Thanks for taking care of us and taking care of yourself.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
 We'll see you next month, okay?

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000
 Okay, thank you.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
 Yes, sir.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000
 Bye.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:25.000
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone, on RadioNetwork.com.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:38.000
 Well, it's kind of cool listening to a fellow that's been around 83 revolutions around the sun and still has this mental capacity going on.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:47.000
 Doing all this research and writing. He's got something going on.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
 All right, kids.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000
 We're going to have a little special show for you tomorrow with Andrew Goss.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:06.000
 It'll be the one-year anniversary of his translating, "Leaving His Body," the last show we did with Andrew Goss on one radio network.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
 I still miss Andrew a lot.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:18.000
 I'll start crying if I talk about it, so I won't talk about it too much.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
 So we'll do that tomorrow.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
 And then I think we'll run the David Wolff one on Thursday.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:30.000
 It's a great show that we had trouble with my internet, so we'll run that on Thursday.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:36.000
 But then we're doing live shows, and we're going to actually start doing more and more live things on Monday and Wednesday.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.000
 So check out our website, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
 All the shows are being posted in audio.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.000
 If you just download those and listen while you're exercising and walking and such.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
 And remember Adam Bergstrom?

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
 He's going to be back more than once a month.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000
 We're going to work some things out with Adam, who we love.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
 He has a blog on, Adam's blog, every two or three days.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
 Great stuff.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:06.000
 Very original material you're not going to find anywhere else with Adam's blog.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:12.000
 And Dr. Jennifer Daniels is going to be here, I guess, next week, and Ken Roll will be back.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
 We're going to talk about castor oil next week.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
 So we've got a lot of good things.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.000
 Let us know people that you'd like to hear about, and we appreciate your ongoing support.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:28.000
 And that's how we do the financial thing here at One Radio Network, is by you purchasing some products.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
 Now if you don't need anything, don't buy any stuff.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
 We're fine. We do good.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:39.000
 But if you need something and you want to look around on our website, in our store, on our website,

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000
 I think you'll find some very nice products.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:54.000
 Sir Thrival, Shen Blossom, the aloe, the Blue Shield, it's a great thing for protecting you from EMFs.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
 Check that one out.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:03.000
 Ken Rolla and his Golden Pyramid, nice thing to put in your room where you sleep.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000
 The sauna, amazing. I use it every day.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000
 Not that that matters, but it's really something to check out.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000
 The Living Streams Probiotics, great sulfur.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000
 People love it. They just keep ordering for years and years.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
 So there's something going on with our sulfur.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.000
 So a few of the things that we work with.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
 Dr. Cowan's powders, don't forget those babies.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
 Some amazing vegetables.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:33.000
 There's no way you're going to eat burdock or all these other different powders.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.000
 He has some great turmeric and sea vegetables.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
 So we have some cool stuff.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
 So I love you all very much.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
 I thank you for your ongoing support.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.000
 Thanks to Sharon for holding this whole thing up because I'm out to lunch most times.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
 And let me know if we can help with anything.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000
 Just email me, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000
 So I love you all. Thank you, and may the blessings be.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:09.000
 Nothing is more expensive than bad information.
