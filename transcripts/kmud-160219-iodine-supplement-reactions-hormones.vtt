 [Music]

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.900
 Welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray. My name is Sarah

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.580
 Johanneson Murray. We both trained in England and graduated there with a

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.220
 degree in herbal medicine and clients consult with us regarding their health

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.300
 issues and we recommend personalized advice in nutrition, supplements, herbs,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.880
 diet, lifestyle. We can be reached toll-free at 1-888-WBM-HERB or on the

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:56.180
 web at www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com. So on tonight's show we're very welcome

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.700
 again to have Dr. Raymond Peat joining us to give us the answers to his wisdom,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.700
 from his wisdom, explaining those things that perhaps not what we normally would

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.620
 hear in the mainstream, almost certainly not what we would hear in the mainstream,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.340
 but nonetheless very well researched, plenty of information there that people

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.820
 can also look at after the show either by visiting Dr. Peat's website at

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.580
 www.raypeat.com. Plenty of articles fully referenced and like I said most of the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.900
 subjects there will have advice and research that you probably would not

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.800
 have heard of elsewhere. So we're always very pleased to have Dr. Peat on the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.460
 show. Thanks for your time Dr. Peat. For people who perhaps have never heard you

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.740
 or listened to the show, would you give people your background, your academic

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.740
 and professional background before we get into the subject? After getting

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.180
 a master's degree in humanities at University of Oregon, I came back in 1968

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:09.220
 to 72 for a biology PhD concentrating on reproductive physiology. The

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.460
 hormones involved in reproduction are involved in everything relating to life

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:27.700
 and brain development was one of my second themes of research. So brain

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.700
 development, aging and the hormones involved in that gradual decline

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.460
 in good health. Okay so just for people that are listening to the show that we

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.100
 will be taking calls from 7.30 till the end of the show either related to this

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.980
 month's continuing topic of nitric

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.740
 oxide. I wanted to get a little bit into the subject of iodine as an opener for

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.740
 the show for people thinking about supplementing with iodine and also open

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.540
 up a little bit about the Zika virus that's really catching media attention

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:08.740
 here. I know there's certain, what do you want to say, authoritative reasons for it and

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.220
 there are other supposedly conspiracy theories that we can call them

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.020
 conspiracies but I think some of the merits of the conspiracies are worth

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.060
 picking up and exploring. Anyway so if you live here in the area

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:29.940
 the number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD or 923-3911. Again that 800 number, we do get

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.020
 people from all over the States calling so that 800 number, let me just spell

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:42.940
 that out for you, that's 1-800-568-3723. So Dr. Peat I was looking today and I

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:50.740
 guess what's prompted it really is hearing the advice of people touting a

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.900
 product called nascent iodine and I know that you specialize in thyroid hormone

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.340
 and that iodine is definitely a key component of thyroid hormone and I think

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.620
 we've always been led to believe that there has been an adequate supply of

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.340
 iodine in the diet and then they produce iodized salt back in the 50s or 60s

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.980
 perhaps earlier or not I'm not too sure but iodized salt has been around and

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.340
 seafood also contains a lot of iodine in its own right so when I heard about this

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:31.140
 product called nascent iodine they were saying that it was essentially not the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:39.140
 stable so stable ionic form and was more available was more readily taken up by

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.500
 the thyroid gland and then I read some other articles about nascent iodine and

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.400
 how reactive it was and I just wanted to feel you out what you what you know

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.180
 about the thyroid's natural need for iodine whether or not we are deficient

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.500
 and whether or not we need supplementation and if in fact this is

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.700
 something actually that may not be necessary. In the 1980s I was looking

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:11.340
 into the iodine nutrition question because I saw some women with breast

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:19.040
 disease who recovered quickly when they took supplements of kelp or thyroid

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.580
 hormone and the safest thing I think it is to correct the thyroid

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:34.380
 problem directly rather than counting on big doses of iodine because the large

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:43.780
 doses over many years for example there are about 70 or more publications

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:50.860
 looking at iodine intake around the world over a period of decades and they

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:58.860
 see that over half a milligram or even especially over one milligram of iodine

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.860
 per day over a population is closely connected with increased risk of

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:16.100
 thyroiditis and thyroid cancer. Wow, so it's aggravatory. One of the theories of

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:23.820
 why that happens is that iodine spontaneously reacts or in the presence

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:30.620
 of white blood cells their enzymes can cause iodine to react with fatty acids

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:39.140
 that are unsaturated and if you've heard about the iodine number to describe the

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:49.260
 degree of unsaturation of a fat for example the food oils that are highly

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:56.260
 unsaturated have a high iodine number that means the number of molecules of

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:03.940
 iodine that will be spontaneously absorbed by a certain quantity of the

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:14.060
 oil because the iodine attacks the double bonds in the fat and where they

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:22.020
 lack hydrogen saturation the iodine fills in analog saturated hydrogen

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:29.380
 content so there is this tendency of unsaturated fats to react with iodine

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:36.020
 and when that happens the body can interpret that as a signal to the

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:43.100
 thyroid gland possibly imitating the thyroid stimulating hormone. Really? Wow.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.940
 So it doesn't cause an increase of thyroid hormone?

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:57.140
 It can fill the site where thyroid stimulating hormone should be

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:04.380
 acting and it can interfere with that so it probably can go either way forcing

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:13.340
 too much activity or more likely blocking the effect of TSH. The

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:20.380
 polyunsaturated fats by themselves interfere with the enzyme which releases

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:26.420
 thyroid hormone from the gland so too much of the unsaturated fats with or

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:33.220
 without iodine will have an anti thyroid effect but potentially the iodine

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:42.260
 reaction could cause overstimulation by thyroid stimulating hormone or in its

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:48.340
 place could imitate the action. But you mentioned the the binding the iodine

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:55.180
 binding to the double bonds producing this product and in its own right that

00:08:55.180 --> 00:09:02.860
 could stimulate a inflammatory thyroiditis and/or a cancer? Yeah I think

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:09.340
 that's why the the high iodine intake around the world statistically is

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:15.900
 associated with greater risk of thyroid cancer and if there really were a

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:22.220
 product that contained a more reactive form of iodine that would just mean that

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:30.500
 it would attack more molecules but I looked up the source of that product of

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:38.100
 one of the products started about 10 years ago and in Texas filed a patent

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:44.540
 that is just completely goofy if you look at the diagram okay it shows

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:50.300
 things that just can't happen right so it was filed 10 years ago and I think

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:57.020
 it still hasn't been and probably never will be actually approved as a patent so

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:03.260
 it you can apply for a patent on any goofy idea and then publish the

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:08.660
 application and impress a lot of people. But maybe not bear the bring the product

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:16.420
 to the market. So iodine supplementation is is very risky and basically you

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:21.100
 should get your trace minerals from seafood sources rather than from

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.980
 isolated iodine supplements and especially not in combination with any

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:30.900
 kind of vegetable polyunsaturated oils? Yeah I think that's true. So just to

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.100
 quickly wrap up this nascent iodine I think the reason that it caught my

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:41.060
 attention was that the media spin on it was that because it didn't have a and in

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.460
 chemistry people hearing this will understand what I'm saying but it's

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.500
 probably I can go and elaborate it more simply perhaps but it doesn't have a

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.340
 stable octet so it's out of electron shell isn't filled and they were saying

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:58.500
 that because of this it was much more much more suitable in some way to

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:04.780
 occupying these sites in the thyroid to produce thyroid hormone but it's very

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.300
 reactivity is counterproductive because surely as soon as you if you could keep

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.500
 it as unreactive as that in a bottle waiting to be ingested wouldn't it

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.940
 surely and react with one of the first things that came into contact with when

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:22.500
 you ingested it just to fill its octet and become stable again? Oh yeah the whole

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:29.940
 idea of newly born or a nascent molecule when I was in junior high and high

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:35.980
 school the chemistry people talked about nascent oxygen which for a few seconds

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.860
 after it's formed in a certain way is highly reactive but that's because the

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:47.300
 electrons are simply in an excited state like it had been sitting in in the

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:55.140
 sunlight too long that's an electronic excitation which quickly passes as it

00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:04.900
 gives off a little bit of energy but in in certain short-term situations of a

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:10.900
 few seconds that kind of excited electron state can make a molecule

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:16.100
 useful for certain reactions but isn't something you'd want to put in your body

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:22.340
 yeah okay so not for in vivo use but maybe in in vitro experimentations it

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:27.660
 might have a some kind of a use. So it's basically a more dangerous form of

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:33.020
 iodine that can cause a free radical reaction? Yeah that's what they're

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:38.500
 talking about but I don't think it even exists in the product. Got it okay well

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.460
 you're listening to AskUrbDr and Kami DeGalbaville 91.1 FM from 730

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.380
 to the end of the show. Callers are invited to call in with any questions

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:52.540
 about this month's wide topic here of things like obviously thyroid hormone is

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.260
 going to interplay in a lot of it but the nascent iodine that we've just

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.300
 brought up here and then the inflammatory reactions that happen

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:04.620
 between estrogen and nitric oxide and what we can do what females as well as

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:09.300
 males can do to offset their burden. Number here if you live in the area is

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.620
 923 3911 if you want an 800 number for toll-free for across the states here

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:24.180
 it's 1-800-568-3723 that translates as 1-800-KMUD-RAD. So Dr. Peat I was

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:29.500
 looking at some abstracts here that we're going to form the show and the

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.660
 first couple caught my attention just because they were based on isoflavones

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:41.340
 and I know from our studying herbal medicine soy and isoflavones were all

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:47.860
 the rage and were touted as being very health beneficial reducing cholesterol

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:52.900
 and all this other ridiculously unscientific information that was

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:58.780
 purported. So from the basis of soy they mentioned that there was

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:08.140
 an alcohol soluble fraction that had been shown essentially to basically

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:15.740
 cause female cancers that these things were taken up by the thyroid or they

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:21.540
 probably inhibited the uptake of iodide from in by the thyroid by the gland and

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:28.700
 that this increased the estradiol in females and that this was I know that

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:33.340
 we've heard about soy and now I know we're definitely aware of soy being very

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:39.300
 pro-carcinogenic because it's a estrogen mimic. But what do you what do you think

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.700
 about this whole industry push that was producing and probably still is

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:49.660
 producing soy infant formula which is one of the main one of the main foods

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:57.100
 that was generated from it. I think it has seriously harmed lots of kids by

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:05.740
 partly the estrogenic effect. The oil itself has a pro-estrogen effect

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:14.900
 anti-thyroid effect apart from the those little molecules the isoflavones. The

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:23.820
 category of flavones or flavonoids it's very similar to the isoflavones. The

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:33.100
 phenyl group or benzene group is just located slightly closer to the keto

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:40.460
 oxygen in the isoflavones and that group seems to be the estrogenic group. The

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:46.740
 other orientation of the benzene group makes it more likely to be anti

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:53.660
 estrogenic and lots of fruits and vegetables contain the anti-estrogenic

00:15:53.660 --> 00:16:02.980
 forms of those but the estrogen industry as a background led to a lot of the

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:11.980
 sales talk about the effects of soy chemicals. And of course is a hugely

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:19.060
 cultivated GMO cultivated product with patents owned for its for its

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:24.500
 propagation and its use. Again no doubt another spawned product from big

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:30.260
 corporations who essentially want to own the product. But don't all legumes have

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:35.940
 these a certain percentage of these isoflavones? Yeah. But just soy is

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:43.260
 particularly high? No I think the main problem with soy besides it being

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:52.780
 basically inedible I think the main problem is that it's almost all grown in

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:59.580
 the genetically modified form that takes large amounts of toxic pesticides. Which

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:04.860
 are estrogenic too right? Yeah. And again just for the guys out there I think it's

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:09.660
 very important to make you aware that you know guys have estrogen. It's not

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:16.620
 just a female dominated situation and soy consumption in males has also been

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:21.980
 positively associated with things like gynecomastia which is another side

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.980
 effect if you like of estrogen activity within males. The very same thing Dr. B

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:32.020
 also isn't it with alcohol drinking alcohol excess excessively can produce

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:38.420
 a symptom of male breasts so that's a estrogen type reaction. When I was a kid

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:47.940
 just before the Second World War we knew some of the very poor immigrants to

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:54.620
 California and there was one couple in which the wife got a job but the father

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:59.580
 could nurse the baby because his estrogen had become so high for

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:05.580
 malnutrition and at the end of the Second World War when soldiers got out

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:11.040
 of the prison camps lots of them had breasts from the effects of prolonged

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:17.980
 starvation. Are we talking lactation too? Well in the case of this man in

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:27.460
 California the wife said pause milk ain't got much strength. Yeah they can

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:33.940
 lactate if they have a baby nursing. Wow so there's enough positive

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:39.100
 feedback in the physiological mechanism there inherently to to produce that. So I

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.780
 guess the high estrogen then stimulated raised their prolactin? Yeah. And then

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.820
 with the suckling it produced milk? Yeah. That is just absolutely

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:53.420
 incredible. Okay so again just for people that are listening it just begs the

00:18:53.420 --> 00:19:00.060
 question again where things like soy and soy products all we ever hear we don't

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.380
 have a television really or listen we don't have a TV at all but we don't

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.580
 listen to either you know broadcasts from mainstream media but what I was

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.660
 going to say was most people have a TV or they're listening to a regular radio

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.260
 station getting the same spin put on things and the same sales pitch and so

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:20.100
 I'm just find it hard to believe that for a long time the whole soy thing

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.100
 could exist and it could do what it did when actually it's more like a waste

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.340
 product and people really shouldn't be eating soy because it's so dangerous in

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.860
 terms of its estrogenic effect on females and males and those estrogenic

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.100
 effects are very pro-inflammatory. Dr. Peate you've pointed out many many

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:42.260
 occasions and I'm currently on board with that same feeling that the the

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.500
 irritation and the inflammation that estrogen promotes is nothing but a

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:51.580
 dangerous process in the body. And also Dr. Peate how would you compare

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:59.620
 estrogen levels with menopausal women and men? With the aging a man's

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:06.780
 estrogen pretty steadily increases but if he has a heart attack it goes up

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:15.460
 sharply or if he has a traumatic injury it goes up during the recovery time but

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:25.180
 generally there's a trend upward in men and in women when the ovaries stop

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:34.220
 cycling there up until about the age of 38 to 40 there is a an actual steady

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:42.700
 increase in estrogen and when the ovaries stop cycling they stop suddenly

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:49.220
 producing progesterone but they continue producing a considerable

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:55.820
 amount of estrogen until the body can adjust it downward. So there are a

00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:03.060
 few years in the 40s or early 50s usually when estrogen is extremely

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:11.380
 excessive relative to the anti-estrogen effect of progesterone but then again

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:17.860
 after the ovaries have pretty much stopped functioning with the rest of

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:28.340
 the body as the progesterone fails all of the other tissues begin the same way

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:35.820
 that happens in men. All of a woman's tissues tend to start increasing their

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:42.260
 production of estrogen so that after menopause the fatter a woman is the more

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:48.540
 estrogen she's producing because the fat tissue is a good source of it but on any

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:55.740
 tissue after menopause to the degree that it's stressed will begin producing

00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:02.140
 estrogen. So is it about the same level between men and women? Yeah. After the

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:09.500
 menopausal period? I think women tend to be fatter in old age and so they are

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:14.860
 more likely to have a higher level of estrogen but just measuring the blood

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:24.460
 estrogen gives a misleading impression because when progesterone is

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:31.940
 deficient the estrogen receptor as well as the aromatase enzyme that makes

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:38.220
 estrogen the receptors bind it in cells and there's no progesterone to destroy

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:45.900
 the estrogen receptor so it just stays in the cell and some of the enzymes that

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:53.500
 are no longer inactivated by progesterone other enzymes capture

00:22:53.500 --> 00:23:00.140
 circulating estrogen that should have been excreted cause it to be deposited

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:09.460
 in cells. Still other enzymes shift any estrogen away from the estrone form to

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:16.700
 the estriol form which is the most active intense estrogen. So everything

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:25.140
 that happens when progesterone is deficient tends to load up various cells

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:31.500
 all through the body with more and more estrogenic stimulation even though it

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.380
 isn't being released to be measured in the blood. Right so the blood test could

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:41.260
 appear that it's fine but if you have a large amount of fat cells that could be

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.460
 stored in that and other tissues and what about weight loss for women who are

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:49.740
 in the menopause if they lose that weight do they then poison themselves

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:55.020
 with estrogen as it comes out of the cells? Just temporarily but it's better

00:23:55.020 --> 00:24:01.900
 to get rid of it and have it local because inside the cells it produces

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:10.500
 things such as breast cancer lung cancer uterine cancer ovarian cancer all of the

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:17.020
 tissues that no longer have enough progesterone are subject to cancer. So

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:21.540
 what about the women that continue to menstruate like I heard from this lady

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:29.780
 the other day that she had a friend who was 17 was still menstruating. I talked

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:35.300
 to a gynecologist who was giving his wife progesterone and she was still

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:46.300
 menstruating at 60 and if you happen to have a very good system for producing

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:52.300
 progesterone there's no reason why it shouldn't stop at 55. There's no reason

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:57.540
 to stop at 55 then right? No. I mean basically would do you think it would be

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.620
 beneficial that women continue to menstruate until the day they die? I

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:12.820
 think so. Like the flamingos? Yeah flamingos have no life limitation

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:21.820
 according to ordinary mortality curves. They seemed only died by accident.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:28.020
 Starvation right? Okay you're listening to Ask Your Doctor KMUD Galbraithville 91.1 FM

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:31.940
 from 7.30 till the end of the show. Please call in with any questions you

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.500
 have either related or unrelated to this month's subject. Number if you're in the

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:42.060
 area area code 707 923 3911 or for those folks in different states across the US

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:49.140
 has an 800 number which is 1-800-568-3723. Dr. Peat I wanted to pick up on a

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.220
 point that you mentioned during your last discourse then I did I've not had

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:56.700
 that before. Progesterone destroys the estrogen receptor. Does anything

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.300
 similarly happen with estrogen doing the same thing to progesterone receptors or

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:06.060
 is it just that way around? Well estrogen activates its own receptor in most

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:16.060
 tissues and it will activate inflammatory things which tend to turn

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:22.100
 off the progesterone receptor if you have an excess.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:33.300
 Generally the normal function would be for progesterone to rise as soon as the

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:40.300
 estrogen has had its surge and then knock it out. The estrogen is fine if

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:46.820
 it's active only for 12 to 24 hours every month. Right, right. It does its job and

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:51.020
 then it's finished. But like you said the tissues will carry on producing estrogen

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:57.260
 especially in obese individuals and menopause or even postmenopausal

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:03.620
 women. Yeah Alexander Lipschutz showed that if you remove the ovaries and then

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:11.860
 implant just a tiny estrogen releasing pellet just a very small but continuous

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:19.620
 dose it's very carcinogenic. But if you interrupt that or even a large dose with

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:26.100
 estrogen with progesterone periodically you don't get cancer. And in his

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:34.660
 experiments the estrogen uninterrupted was carcinogenic to uterus, breast, lungs,

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:41.700
 kidneys, brain and intestine. Yeah. Basically everything. Okay so just

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.700
 another another call for all the ladies out there. There really is nothing I

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.180
 know it's a personal thing but there's nothing wrong with continuing your

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:54.020
 menstrual cycle as long as you possibly can. Progesterone is your friend,

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:58.140
 estrogen is your enemy and the only thing really that estrogen is any good

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.380
 for is the implantation. So I may have a first caller so let's get this first

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:09.420
 caller on the air. Caller where are you from? I'm from Kansas City. Did you say Kansas City?

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:18.020
 Yeah Kansas City. Oh hey welcome to the show. Thanks. Hi Dr. Peat. What do you think is

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:22.580
 happening if someone experiences digested cramps and bloating within 30 minutes

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:27.180
 when using vitamin E orally and which still occurs even when switching to a

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:31.780
 few different products as well as even when using several drops of progeste

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:41.660
 which also contains vitamin E? I think it's the viscous oily quality that is

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:50.860
 irritating. Some people have that reaction for example if they try to

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:57.300
 use it in their armpit where the skin is very sensitive the highly viscous oil

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:04.620
 can be very irritating so I think it should be taken with food so that it

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:10.500
 doesn't hit any of the membranes in the concentrated form. Do you think it's

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:22.020
 possible to develop a soy allergy somewhere along the way? Yeah many people

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:30.340
 do have soy allergies but the oil doesn't contain any of the proteins that

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:40.100
 people are allergic to so I haven't heard of any documented allergy to oily

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:48.060
 soy products such as soy oil. Okay do you think it's possible that for that person

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:52.020
 that's something like 400 units international units of the

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:57.220
 alpha-tocopherol with 300 milligrams of gamma, delta and beta-tocopherol is

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:02.220
 excessive and possibly being excreted mostly in bile which is alkaline and

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.220
 possibly irritating to an already irritated intestine which would maybe

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:17.580
 cause the cramps and bloating? I doubt it because the effect of vitamin E on many

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:24.740
 cell processes is anti-inflammatory for example it inhibits prostaglandin

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:35.620
 formation similar to aspirin in its range of anti-inflammatory effects.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:40.780
 Okay that's great thank you. All right thank you for your call. We do have another call

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.180
 on the air so let's take this next caller. Caller where are you from?

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:49.580
 Hi I'm calling from Mexico. Mexico, the first caller from Mexico. Welcome to the

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:56.460
 show what's your question? Thanks hi if I understood correctly earlier you were

00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:04.020
 talking about how taking extra iodine can interact with PUFA to cause problems

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:12.460
 and I know someone who took a few milligrams of extra iodine and she went

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:21.100
 into a some kind of thyroid hyperthyroid like crisis state where she couldn't

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:27.420
 tolerate any physical exertion. Her muscles were really weak and her pulse

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:35.540
 was very high and years later she still gets that reaction from thyroid and I

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:44.860
 was wondering if that's related to iodine? Back in the years when many people

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:56.180
 were in certain regions for example in southern Mexico, western China and Ohio

00:31:56.180 --> 00:32:03.860
 Eastern Europe those areas were very deficient in iodine and they would

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:10.500
 develop an enlargement of the thyroid gland and then when they ate iodine even

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:17.700
 a fairly normal amount suddenly their gland would start forming thyroid hormone

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:27.300
 and if the goiter was very big they could have serious hyperthyroidism that

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:33.700
 could last for years but if the gland was just slightly swollen it would pass

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:42.060
 in about two months. So that's a that's a very real sequelae of using iodine in

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:48.140
 that particular individual that they would have that increased thyroid

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.700
 production that would be you know resulting in what the callers just

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:57.380
 mentioned? Yeah if they took their iodine in the form of thyroid hormone they could

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:05.340
 normalize their body functions and be replacing iodine in a limited

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:09.820
 graded fashion so that they wouldn't go into those hyperthyroid states and

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:16.340
 getting the required amount of hormone would cause their pituitary to settle

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:22.300
 down and let the gland gradually shrink. Because that is treatment for goiter is

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:28.300
 that you supplement with thyroid hormone? Yes to treat hyperthyroidism

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:34.860
 the safest thing is to supplement usually with thyroid hormone. So again

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:39.120
 just to just to expand on the very first question to Dr. Peate about the nascent

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:44.140
 iodine it's not a good idea and also many other forms of iodine

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:48.660
 supplementation is not necessary and if you need iodine and you have any kind of

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:52.900
 low thyroid actually thyroid hormone is the best way to get bound iodine. Okay

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:58.340
 did you have anything else you wanted to bring out caller? Well thanks a lot I was

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:03.540
 just wondering if it you know if it would be a good idea to do anything

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:10.740
 specific to try to rectify this this problem or if there's any tips on

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:17.620
 tolerating thyroid does avoiding iodine help in a situation like that? The people

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:25.500
 who have trouble with the actual thyroid hormone they can be either deficient in

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:32.540
 magnesium because hypothyroidism makes all of your tissues fail to retain a

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:38.020
 normal amount of magnesium and then when you supplement it suddenly you

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:44.300
 experience an extreme magnesium deficiency in your heart for example and

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:51.940
 your brain and so taking some magnesium at the same time as the thyroid it will

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:59.380
 help those people. Others if they're deficient in adrenal or ovarian or

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:08.220
 gonadal steroids will suffer stress symptoms when they take thyroid and and

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:14.860
 so using a supplement such as pregnenolone will make them tolerate

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:20.060
 adapting to the thyroid more easily. And what about Dr. Peat how some people if

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:25.220
 they supplement with t4 thyroxine they will have those symptoms like our caller

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.260
 mentioned where their muscles are weak and they their hearts pounding they're

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.460
 pulses high and isn't that because if they're already low thyroid and they

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.580
 take the t4 then they're actually stimulating the adrenaline because

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:42.300
 they're not converting it? Yeah when when people have suffered for a long time

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:48.940
 with low thyroid they're likely to have extremely high adrenaline and cortisol

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:57.780
 levels and that causes them to turn t4 into reverse t3 blocking the actual

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:05.700
 active t3 hormone and then if they accumulate more and more t4 that will

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:13.220
 interfere competitively with a little bit of t3 that they do have so they can

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:20.380
 exaggerate the state of their hypothyroidism if they're in that really

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:26.460
 extreme stress state. Could you say that t4 perhaps is mainly only 10% as

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:35.340
 active as the active t3 hormone? It really varies in the 1940s when they

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:43.060
 first synthesized it they tested it on male medical students and it was exactly

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:53.300
 as effective as armor natural thyroid but that's because young men 20 22 years

00:36:53.300 --> 00:37:02.060
 old have very good livers that can perfectly convert it but even at the

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:08.860
 same age women are more likely to have problems with plain thyroxine. But when

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:14.500
 they talk about t4 being weakly active how do you how do you interpret that or

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:21.260
 how do you see t3 versus t4 in terms of orchestrating metabolic events?

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:30.140
 The standard textbook idea is that t3 is four times more powerful than t4

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:36.220
 but really if your liver is good you can get a hundred percent of the benefit out

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:46.900
 of t4 and if you're a woman under stress with high estrogen your liver isn't

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:53.780
 going to convert any of it to the right active hormone and the more you take I've

00:37:53.780 --> 00:38:01.740
 known of one woman was hospitalized and got more and more hypothyroid the higher

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:06.740
 they raised her thyroxine dose and as soon as they gave her t3 became right

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:13.420
 out of the myxedema coma but I've seen people in less extreme states who got

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:18.500
 more and more depressed or psychotic or whatever when they increased their

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:22.780
 thyroxine dose. Okay I have one more question for the caller do you know if

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:28.140
 this lady you're speaking about was taking a t3 t4 combination supplement or

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:33.060
 were they taking just t4 or just t3 are you aware of that? Well yeah originally

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:38.540
 she was taking an armor supplement and when she took the supplemental iodine

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:45.340
 that caused the problem and since then she has tried different t4 t3 combo

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:52.020
 products as well as a couple different pure t3 supplements so I think it's

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:56.860
 something to do with this adrenaline or sensitivity to adrenaline that Dr.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:02.700
 Peat was was talking about where if I understand it correctly the thyroid

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:09.900
 sensitizes the tissues to the already high the already existing adrenaline. But

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.340
 that should only last a couple days and then it should balance out. Well

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:20.860
 sometimes it lasts for a couple of weeks if you're really extreme you have to use

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:28.860
 little bits of supplements and be very careful about your intake of protein

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:37.360
 sugar calcium everything that is counter to the stress. So when you're in a

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:42.660
 situation like that she was using very small specks of t3 you know under one

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:48.260
 microgram sometimes is this thing to do to hold that very low dose for a couple

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:52.820
 weeks and then increase it in very very small increments as the adrenaline

00:39:52.820 --> 00:40:02.060
 hopefully comes down? Yeah I've known people who for a week or two would stay

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:10.420
 with one microgram doses of t3 but you have to make sure your whole diet

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:20.460
 is very good. Having hormone tests and a vitamin D blood test is helpful because

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:27.500
 magnesium and calcium work together and vitamin D regulates them. Yeah and making

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.100
 sure that she's getting plenty of carbohydrates like in the form of fruit

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:35.980
 juices because that's like Dr. Peat saying make sure nutritionally she's

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:40.180
 getting at least 75 grams of protein. I don't know the weight and nutritional

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:48.740
 needs but at least 150 grams or more of sugars and good fats. Okay thanks very

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:53.260
 much. All right thanks for sure. I think we have another caller there. Yeah okay we

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:57.660
 have the next caller. Caller where are you from? Hi I'm calling from New York. Yeah

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:02.700
 welcome to the show. What's your question? Hi I have a question for Dr. Peat about

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:09.380
 Buteyko breathing and heart rate. Dr. Buteyko noted that as you progress with

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:15.180
 retaining more and more co2 with the Buteyko breathing then the heart rate

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:20.780
 will decrease and I wondered what you thought about that. I've noticed that in

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:26.780
 my own practice that it does go down but the temperature is still good and I

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:34.260
 wondered if the metabolism is still good when that happens or what you think

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:39.740
 about it? Yeah there have been experiments with animals increasing

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:47.020
 their co2 and watching what happens to the heart and blood vessels and co2

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:54.020
 relaxes the blood vessels so it decreases peripheral resistance and that

00:41:54.020 --> 00:42:02.500
 makes the heart able to pump more blood more easily with less work. So it usually

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:11.100
 means a bigger stroke volume. Okay so the decreased heart rate. Even though it's a

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:18.620
 lower heart rate you think that that you can still get the same benefits as you

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:23.180
 would if you weren't restricting your breathing but I mean I mean I know you

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:27.260
 recommend a high heart rate typically for people that aren't practicing that

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:35.020
 kind of breath control. Yeah but that's most people are running on

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:42.180
 adrenaline. I've known people who one woman had had a hundred and eighty pulse

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:48.700
 steadily for years another person had been around 130 resting pulse for a long

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:54.860
 time. Both of these people within two weeks got down to a normal under a

00:42:54.860 --> 00:43:00.380
 hundred pulse rate when they supplemented thyroid and one of the

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:06.500
 things the thyroid is doing is increasing your co2 decreasing the

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:13.380
 lactic acid and the inflammation so that your capillaries open up you have less

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:21.180
 peripheral resistance so your heart doesn't have to work so frantically. Okay

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:25.980
 well thank you very much. Thanks dear call caller. Okay so for anybody else

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.380
 listening here it's always good to get people from all over the state so we've

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:33.180
 had Mexico so far we've had New York Midwest so let's keep it up there's an

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:40.460
 800 number here it's 800 568 3723 we've got Dr. Ray Peat with us on the show and

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:43.980
 he's sharing his wisdom so I guess until the phones ring again for the next time

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:47.820
 I wanted to ask you we haven't actually got very far through with all the

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.620
 questions I wanted to ask you at this point which is good news because people

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:54.220
 have been calling but I may have to carry on this topic next month perhaps if

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:58.060
 you're available. I saw the article there which again just highlights the

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:02.420
 estrogenic problem that the benign and malignant thyroid nodules are far more

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:08.100
 common in females than males no doubt a consequence of estradiol so given that

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:14.060
 the mainstream lie is that estrogen is good for you and healthy and what can be

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.700
 done do you think simply to offset the estrogen I know you've mentioned

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:22.180
 progesterone which is probably the first thing that springs into my mind but in

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:30.860
 terms of reducing a female's estrogenic burden. There were some studies of slices

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:39.840
 of thyroid gland in vitro and they found that added estrogen caused the cells to

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:47.340
 keep synthesizing hormone but and to keep growing but to fail to secrete any

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:53.660
 of the hormone when they added progesterone it began secreting the

00:44:53.660 --> 00:45:03.360
 hormone and up until the last few decades women rather than just having

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:09.480
 nodules in their thyroid they were the ones most susceptible to growing a

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:19.080
 very large goiter that sometimes was as big as a cantaloupe and the nodules are

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:28.760
 basically the same process of estrogen activating the cell division and

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:38.920
 synthesis of colloid the material that the hormone later will be made from and

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:47.680
 desensitizing the cells to the the hormone secreting effect of thyroid

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:56.560
 stimulating hormone and progesterone by antagonizing estrogen will reverse those

00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:05.200
 processes but when you get the cells multiplying and making the protein you

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:14.200
 will get at least a nodule maybe if it continues steadily the whole gland will

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:18.120
 get bigger and bigger. Okay we do actually have another caller so let's

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.560
 just hold that for right there and take this next caller so caller you're on the

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:26.720
 air and where you from? How you doing I'm from right here in town. Okay a local

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:32.160
 caller you're welcome what's your question? I was curious to know if this I

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:39.160
 heard you talking about the vitamin D in the thyroid and the magnesium I'm just

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.960
 wondering if that would have anything to do with what's called restless legs

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:47.040
 syndrome. Yeah Dr. Peter that magnesium deficiency or how would you explain

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:55.400
 restless legs syndrome? There has been quite a lot of research for example they

00:46:55.400 --> 00:47:02.440
 noticed that people taking SSRI antidepressants tended to have episodes

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:10.360
 of restless legs and so they saw that nitric oxide and serotonin were

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:18.240
 involved in producing it and those are produced largely from the intestine the

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:24.760
 most intense problem of both serotonin and nitric oxide production is from an

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:33.680
 irritated intestine and hypothyroid people over produce both nitric oxide

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:41.560
 and serotonin typically and have sluggish digestive systems and often

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:50.720
 have a tendency to generalized inflammation and the serotonin seems to

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:58.520
 be specifically what pushes those motor nerves the cause of the leg jumpiness.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:04.040
 Does that help you out or explain things to you caller? Yeah yeah somewhat it does

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:10.400
 it's not an adrenaline thing that makes the legs jump it's serotonin yeah

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:16.360
 having to do with what sorry all of the inflammatory stress things tend to go

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:21.400
 together. So would you recommend like aspirin for restless leg syndrome? Um

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:30.360
 yeah pregnenolone aspirin and avoiding irritating foods especially legumes and

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:37.040
 raw green salads those are very irritating. Those are things that increase

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:46.200
 the bowel production of serotonin? Yeah. Beans and raw vegetables? That's

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:49.800
 interesting because we just switched to trying to eat better and we had gone to

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:54.720
 eating a lot more both of those. Have you noticed your restless leg syndrome?

00:48:54.720 --> 00:49:02.400
 It's a female it's my partner. Okay. And it's becoming very extreme and that

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:08.920
 may very well be just from the diet. She was has a vitamin D

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:16.400
 deficiency. She's told to take vitamin D and magnesium. Yeah. Do you know what

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:20.880
 her vitamin D level was and how much she's taking? I don't know exactly

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:26.560
 in measurement but it was very low. Right. Well the most most drop forms of

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:31.640
 vitamin D now that 2,000 IU a drop and if she has low vitamin D it's probably

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:36.800
 below 20 maybe right around 20 which is very low and they've raised the

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:42.960
 reference limit for vitamin D now up to about 45 so you supplementing with a

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:48.880
 2,000 IU per day drop product she should be really loading up with six to

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:54.360
 eight drops a day for about four or five days and then getting 4,000 to 6,000 IU

00:49:54.360 --> 00:50:00.360
 and then re-measuring her vitamin D. After about two months. Yeah. Okay so

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:05.320
 Dr. Peat said that bowel irritation, inflammation will increase serotonin

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:08.440
 production and that serotonin production with nitric oxide which we're going to

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:12.400
 got a question for Dr. Peat about nitric oxide both those two compounds there can

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:17.900
 be predisposed predisposing someone to restless leg syndrome. Anyway

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:23.120
 thanks for your call. So Dr. Peat I saw today just in fact I was thinking about

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.880
 it myself. I started looking at a couple of websites that do blood

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.640
 testing etc and I couldn't see any nitric oxide blood testing tests done

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:38.160
 but I did see salivary tests for those salivary nitrite strips to assess the

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:43.520
 potential nitric oxide production in the body. I know it will be formed from

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:49.320
 nitrite or nitrate and this site actually was this the funny thing is

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:53.480
 this site was actually letting you know how you could increase your nitric oxide

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.840
 more now you've been eating various foods which I wanted to question about

00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.060
 also because I know some of the Greens here that were promoting the nitric

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:04.080
 oxide production with things that we actually are promoting as being

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:08.120
 beneficial but there's obviously a reason for that now. So how do you feel

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:13.600
 about testing your salivary nitrate nitrite level and how predictive or

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:18.600
 preemptive that would be of nitric oxide production systemically? A recent

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:24.080
 article just a couple of weeks ago came out suggesting measuring the nitric

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:29.560
 oxide or its products in the body as a way of diagnosing hypothyroidism because

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:35.560
 they're so closely connected but I would guess that the urine might be better

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:41.640
 than the saliva because for other hormone testing for example just

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:46.680
 thinking of food or being anxious or whatever can really change the

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:51.020
 composition of your saliva. Right okay so you think that because that changes so

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:55.040
 quickly then you're saying it's a not probably more relative to test something

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:59.720
 that's there and it's stored and probably more representative of a

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:06.840
 couple of hours of physiology? Yeah I think that the urine will give you a

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:12.120
 good picture of your level of stress. You wouldn't want to test that after eating

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:15.040
 spinach either with your saliva. Here's the other thing that was my other

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:19.560
 question is even this website was touting nitric oxide as being beneficial

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:23.560
 and actually spinach was a very good producer of nitrite and how that

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:27.400
 was spinach would increase your nitric oxide and and they were touting

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:32.600
 that. I know and I just want to ask you just to be realistic here and be real

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:38.320
 for folks I know we mentioned greens purporting greens and boiled greens and

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:43.000
 drinking the juice is very beneficial I know that you do say that kale can have

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.360
 a thyroid suppressive effect so not to use much kale but spinach I think has

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:52.400
 been one of those greens that has been portrayed as being relatively healthy so

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:56.480
 what do you what do you think about spinach? If they're organically grown

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:03.280
 without intense nitrate fertilization and if it's well cooked I think

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:07.120
 spinach is good food. Okay we do have two more callers I don't know if we're

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:11.000
 going to get them in they just appeared on the dial so let's say this next

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.720
 caller. Caller where are you from? Hello? Yeah you're on the air where are you from?

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.920
 Yeah I'm from Shelter Cove. Shelter Cove hi what's your question? My question

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:25.920
 is for my daughter actually she wants to take testosterone and I'm wondering what

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:30.240
 his take on it is if he has any experience with that how she can keep

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:34.160
 herself healthy. How old is she and what's the what's the indication for

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:39.280
 taking the testosterone? Well she's transgender she wants to be more male

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:48.000
 and she is 16. 16 okay and I did you catch what the symptom was? She's

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.000
 transgender. Okay transgender I didn't really hear that properly. Dr. Peat?

00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 Wanting to masculinize? Yes. I think that's safe but it should be backed up

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:08.680
 with pregnenolone and some progesterone to keep things in balance because the

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:19.360
 tendency is if you're under stress of any sort for the testosterone to turn to

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:26.720
 estrogen and the pregnenolone and progesterone will limit that conversion.

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:34.200
 Okay. If you have access to either those both of those can be can be

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:40.000
 obtained so progesterone and pregnenolone typically for a female

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.360
 anyway they would normally be producing them and I don't know exactly the

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:47.080
 details of the case and how the transgender nature of this subject is

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:53.400
 either affected adversely or positively so in terms of their exposure to their

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:57.760
 own natural progesterone being female and and or supplementing with

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:02.080
 pregnenolone then that will offset the potentially negative effects that may

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.280
 occur with using testosterone in a female. Because it could convert to

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:09.920
 estrogen and become dangerously out of balance. And watching thyroid function.

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:14.400
 Uh-huh okay. All right well thanks for your call we better take this next question. Thank you for your help.

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:18.280
 You're welcome. Okay so caller we've got about three minutes if you can get your

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:21.280
 question out to the doctor here and do it in three minutes and get a response

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:28.880
 we'll wrap the show up. Where are you from? Are they there? Hey caller you on the air?

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.600
 All right we had the second call Dr. Peat but never mind because we've only got

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:39.560
 five minutes left so okay. All right I don't even know if we've got time to

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:43.480
 perhaps ask another ask another question without running out of time but I'll

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:48.400
 try here and I think we'll definitely open this up again next month if

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.360
 you are available because I've hardly got any questions asked here because

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:55.560
 we've had so many callers and that's a good thing. I wanted to ask you again and

00:55:55.560 --> 00:56:00.760
 with them I guess again we get the female issue in estrogen and inflammation

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:09.440
 and cancers etc are pretty obvious as definite definite realities here. In

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:14.840
 terms of the effect of iodide uptake by thyroid cells and the inhibitory effects

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:19.240
 that estrogen has on that in a female again would you be typically just

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:23.800
 wanting to lower estrogenic burden by offsetting that with progesterone and

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:30.480
 pregnenolone and/or thyroid? Yeah thyroid and good adequate nutrition all the

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:39.160
 vitamins and minerals are involved in controlling keeping estrogen under the

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:48.600
 safe safe limit and the when you inhibit the formation of thyroid hormone either

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:56.080
 with an iodine deficiency or an estrogen excess the thyroid stimulating hormone

00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:04.360
 fails to make the thyroxine and T3 and so it keeps stimulating not only the

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:12.160
 thyroid gland making it grow and get bigger or nod nodules to form but it has

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:17.960
 a related effect on every tissue to some extent especially the ovaries

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:26.040
 polycystic ovarian syndrome is associated with low thyroid and

00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:34.600
 especially high TSH. TSH drives inflammation so that the so-called

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:41.640
 autoimmune conditions associated with high estrogen women are far more

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:49.880
 susceptible to all types of autoimmune diseases than males and that's largely

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:58.360
 because of the high TSH exposure driving things like tumor necrosis factor and

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:05.280
 the various cytokines and interleukins and prostaglandins that are activated.

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:09.240
 Excellent I don't want to cut you short Dr. Peat and I really appreciate your

00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:13.400
 your knowledge as do I know all the people that have tuned in and taken the

00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:18.760
 time to listen and call from all over so a really really good show from all over

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:22.560
 the country I appreciate people calling. Dr. Peat's website let me just sign off

00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:26.080
 giving out your information Dr. Peat so people can find out more. Unless there

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:30.960
 was any last words you wanted to say Dr. Peat. Okay thank you. Thanks so much.

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:39.080
 Okay so Dr. Peat has a pretty extensive referenced library in some ways

00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:45.800
 of symptoms and diseases and the mainstream science is argued against

00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:52.600
 with real science so the objective science of non-profiteering

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:57.320
 organizations is bought out so much of the details that you'll find there and

00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:02.120
 listed in the fully referenced sections that come with each article on thyroid

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:08.240
 hormones, saturated fats, regular hormones, pregnenolone, estradiol, whether it's salt

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:12.240
 or sugar or cholesterol any of the other articles that he's done is a whole range

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:17.960
 of them fully referenced his website www.raypeat.com it's one minute to the

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:22.680

 925. Thanks for your time and again next month we'll bring out more questions for

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:41.120
 the doctor and they'll be contrary to public and regular opinion which is

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.640
 always a good thing to give you the alternative then you can make your mind

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.880
 up. The facts are out there if you want to look for them. Okay good night. Thank
