00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.600
 Hello everyone, I'm Danny Roudy of DannyRoudy.com

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.700
 and today I'm talking with painter, philosopher, biologist, Raymond Peat.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.700
 In this half hour long episode, we'll talk about the history and origins of authoritarianism

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.100
 and how the philosophy is baked into our cultural, political, and medical systems.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.100
 In addition to thanking Ray for talking with me today,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.200
 I'd like to thank my patrons for making this show and all the content I produce possible.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 If you would like to become a patron, please go to patreon.com/dannyroudy.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.800
 As always, please do your own research and come to your own conclusions.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.200
 And in the spirit of William Blake, the true method of knowledge is experiment.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200
 Without further ado, here is the show.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 [Music]

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.900
 Hello.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.000
 Ray.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.800
 Yeah, hi.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.200
 Hey, how are you?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.200
 Good.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.000
 [Laughter]

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.300
 Thank you so much for doing this.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.000
 I've been interested in this topic for a while

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 and I had a chance to read through "Public Passivity and the Screw"

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.600
 and I thought it was fantastic and I kind of made some notes about that,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.800
 but if you—I don't have any specific direction I wanted to take the show,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.400
 so if you have like a thought—

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.500
 Was that a section in a newsletter or what was it?

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.500
 It was September 2003 and I have it in front of me here.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.500
 You kind of summarized it and you were like,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.400
 "I wrote this several years ago, but each month there was something more topical to send out."

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.600
 We don't have to go strictly through that,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.000
 but I was thinking like authoritarianism, when you talk about it,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.700
 it seems to be an ambiguous term to a lot of people.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.900
 So I thought before we got into kind of the weeds,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.900
 you could talk about what it means to you

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.500
 and then your general experience with it, maybe growing up and scientifically.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.700
 Academically, there has been a study now for, I guess, about 50 years.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.100
 Bob Altemeier's book, "The Authoritarians," which came out—

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.600
 I guess he put it on the internet maybe five or ten years ago—

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:45.600
 and Bob Dean, the Watergate lawyer, became a fan of it

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:57.400
 and helped to publicize it because it was about the psychology of political authoritarianism primarily.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.800
 His main focus is on what he calls the right-wing authoritarians.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.700
 In my understanding of it, which started long before that,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.600
 it was the intuitive thing of seeing that in the culture,

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:23.100
 there is the unreasoning submission to the ideas of anyone in power

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.800
 and conformism around what is taken to be the power-enforced authoritative doctrine.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.300
 In reacting to Bob Altemeier's version of it,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.500
 I have seen that in some ways publicizing these traits of the right-wing authoritarian,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.500
 you might be adding to the confusion somewhat.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.800
 One of Altemeier's images for how this can be conceptualized comes from Theodor Adorno,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.900
 a group at Berkeley who made the subject popular,

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.400
 I think it was in the '60s when they were getting famous for it.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.000
 Adorno's image was that it's the posture for riding a bicycle,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.700
 bowing from the waist up and kicking from the waist down.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.700
 In other words, submission to authority of the power of those above you,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.500
 knocking down anyone that's below you to keep them below you.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.400
 Bob Altemeier says that it isn't a very good image.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.200
 He used questionnaires and got really clear results,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.900
 but then other people using a scale of social prestige-seeking,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.500
 power-seeking, identified people rather than conforming and fitting

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.000
 into wherever they find themselves on the scale.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.900
 They are only driven towards rising.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.200
 You can think of the sociopath or the psychopath who cares about nothing but winning

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.600
 and isn't satisfied until they come out owning everything and controlling everyone.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.000
 Over the last 50 or 60 years, there have been various sociologists

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.200
 who look at different parts of the psychology of politics and society.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:24.800
 And ideas like "interdirected" and "otherdirected" that was popular in the '50s,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.600
 that you can fit into the idea of submission to authority

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.400
 and aggression against those below you in power.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:43.000
 But the "otherdirected" doesn't necessarily limit itself to this authoritarian scheme.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.900
 People can be "otherdirected" while they're trying to achieve something.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.400
 Like the people voting for Bernie can look to the movement

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.200
 and try to integrate themselves into a movement to see what can be optimized.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.000
 So they're being told that if they blend themselves into the Democratic Party,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.600
 they can improve that idea depending on their directedness.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:17.200
 And the "interdirected" idea is that you're sort of spring-loaded in childhood

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.600
 to go in a certain direction.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.000
 So the people who say, "If I can't have Bernie winning the election,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.400
 we'll maybe go off and find something just as good or better

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.800
 and vote for Jill Stein or the Greens or such."

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.000
 So "interdirection" can push you forward on a consistent line

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 where the "otherdirection" can be looking for compromise and such.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.400
 So it can be either forward-directed or simply authoritarian.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.600
 And throughout the 20th century, for example,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:59.000
 Freud said, "Repression is a good thing," fitting into the system.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.200
 And from the time I was, I guess, in high school,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.300
 people were saying, "You have to work within the system."

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.700
 And my first thoughts on that were imagining what they were saying,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:17.800
 that if you cooperate in the system for 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 years,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:24.000
 look at the pile of criminal activities you have participated in,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.800
 then you'll have the power to do something.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.200
 And the first thing you do, you're out of the system.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:37.600
 So you have a huge accumulated pile of bad stuff.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.200
 And then the first chance you have to do good stuff,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.200
 you might get a sizable, noticeable achievement,

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.800
 but it's always going to be smaller than what you did in the opposite direction,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.200
 getting there.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.600
 So I wasn't sold on the idea that you have to work within the system

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.400
 because it's really just a way of buying people into the system,

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.000
 telling them that maybe someday you would be able to do some good.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Freud really allied with the oppressing class

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.200
 and he created this idea of the ego mediating between the id and the superego.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.800
 It has to balance these forces,

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.200
 but he really came down on the side of the superego,

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.000
 smashing the id when necessary.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.800
 And around 1929 or '30,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.200
 Wilhelm Reich realized what Freud was doing,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.000
 and he believed that Freud was very conscious

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.600
 of the rightness of Reich's position,

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.400
 that you're never going to have a healthy individual

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.200
 as long as they're being oppressed.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:53.200
 He believed that Freud simply wanted to save his movement from Nazism

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.200
 and make it able to survive by giving in to the oppression.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.800
 From the 1920s,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.800
 Reich was saying that there's an emotional plague all through the world,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.800
 not just fascism, but it's the plague of authoritarianism.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:17.600
 And at first he said education and medicine, psychiatry, can cure people of this,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:27.200
 but then next thing he realized was that first you have to cure the doctors and the teachers of the emotional plague.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.000
 I think Reich was essentially right,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.200
 but I think it really is more than just an emotional plague.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:42.200
 I think it's something like a historical, intellectual, epistemological plague

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.200
 built into the way we believe knowledge works.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.400
 Did it originate from Plato and Aristotle?

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.800
 Do you see like an origin for this type of oppressive society?

00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:00.000
 Yeah, as soon as I started looking into encyclopedias and such,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.200
 trying to find explanations,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.600
 I think it goes even before Plato. Parmenides and Zeno,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.000
 they were the Greek school located in southern Italy, the Eleatics,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.600
 and they argued that there is only one reality and it doesn't change, doesn't do anything.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.800
 There is no movement.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:30.800
 And someone as smart as Bertrand Russell praised the subtlety of Zeno's paradoxes and such,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.800
 but Russell was struggled for years in what seems like very stupid arguments,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:44.200
 but he was smart enough to work himself out of that set of paradoxical mental activities

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.400
 that Western philosophy had been trapped in for 2,500 years.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:59.600
 And Plato essentially gave in to the Parmenides school of thinking that at least the knowledge part of existence,

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:06.200
 which is the real part of existence, is unchanging, eternal, and perfect.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:14.000
 And really was making worse of the crude ideas of Parmenides.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.800
 And Aristotle really acknowledged some of the reality of Heraclitus.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:28.000
 Heraclitus said everything flows exactly polar opposite of Plato and Parmenides,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.600
 that nothing moves. Heraclitus said that's what it is, everything is moving.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.600
 And reason, meaning, steers everything through everything.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.400
 So it wasn't a jumbled random movement.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:49.600
 It was a developmental process which as a whole is steered by meaning.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:57.000
 Aristotle tried to formalize this using some of the concepts of Plato,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.600
 but putting it into a sensible scheme in which he had different kinds of causality,

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:11.600
 including the final cause principle, which is that things are moved according to meaning or intention.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:19.000
 The universality of motion has no randomness in it. Everything is meaningful.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:30.600
 Everything can be seen in terms of the first cause and the final cause and the various causes consisting of their nature.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:36.600
 So that for Aristotle, laws were derived from the nature of things.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.600
 They weren't in some other eternal world like for Plato.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.200
 Well that goes back to the newsletter. You say laws were written in the past.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:51.000
 And since the past isn't accessible, it's almost as though a foreign power ruled from a distant imperial capital.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Maybe this goes back to your writing on Blake, and you say that that's a representation of the past,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 and it's trying to retain the past into the current view of things.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.800
 Is that the problem with not only these laws, but politics maybe in general?

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:16.200
 Oh yeah. The Platonic idea is creating a false reality for everything that we have in our memory.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:23.800
 Seeing everything in terms of the past, something that we have at one time generalized,

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.200
 and then saying that's absolute and unchanging.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:33.000
 And what it does is to say that all of these current events are random happenings.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 They don't contain the meaning in themselves. They only get the meaning from these generalizations,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 and those are all eternal, out of time.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 And this was taken up in the physics with the idea of randomness, the assumption of randomness,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 which can then be treated statistically.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 But it's a belief about current events and the nature of substance and experience

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.600
 that it's proclaimed to be of a lower order and essentially lacking meaning or purpose.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.600
 And so the mathematical statistics is needed to make sense of it.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:17.800
 And this was Parmenides' doctrine, was that you had to be indoctrinated into his school

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:24.800
 and learn his language of mathematics before you really were a citizen or a human being.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:31.800
 Using knowledge in this frozen, abstracted sense to identify the value of a person.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:37.400
 And so Plato argued for tyranny, that the people who know would have the power,

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.800
 and the power would be logic and mathematics.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.800
 When this was put into action by the physicists, they proclaimed themselves,

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:51.800
 those who did physics were those who knew the ultimate fundamental truth.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.800
 When biology wanted to gain status, they said they would model themselves

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.800
 on the true basic science of physics.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:06.800
 And so to find the eternal ruling class elements of the world,

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.800
 the physicists looked for timeless, unchanging atoms.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.800
 The individual atom had no unique features, no history,

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.800
 and was an absolute and pure Platonic thing.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:24.800
 But the only way they can be treated is by assuming that all of their later developments,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.800
 their movements, all of these are meaningless and random

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.800
 and have to be described only statistically.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:38.800
 And in modeling biology on physics, the equivalent of the timeless, unchanging atom

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.800
 was the timeless, unchanging gene.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.800
 Again, the soma, the body that we experience,

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.800
 was said to be basically just mortal junk that would be cast aside every generation

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.800
 while the immortal germline collection of genes was what was really important.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.800
 And this was developed very closely with people like Herbert Spencer,

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:08.800
 who identified that even Darwin was a racist that believed that English plants and animals

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.800
 and people were the best in the world.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.800
 [laughter]

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.800
 You mentioned psychopaths before, and in the KMUD interview,

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.800
 in the quote you mentioned the Dulles brothers,

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.800
 and I think you were alluding to a book by David Talbott called The Devil's Chessboard.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.800
 Was that correct?

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.800
 Yeah, I think that's his name.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.800
 You mentioned Reich before, and the connection with Dali,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.800
 and the persistence of memory in Dali's shift,

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.800
 integrating himself into the fascist culture,

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.800
 and you mentioned it started in about 1945.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:51.800
 I was curious just to unpack that and your thoughts on the CIA and the Dulles brothers

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.800
 and anything else you had to say about it.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.800
 Well, 20th century history pretty much involved the Dulles brothers.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.800
 They were working with Hitler and with the fascist Germans right from the beginning,

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.800
 and one of them was declared to be an enemy agent,

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:14.800
 and the German government had put their American properties in his name,

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.800
 and so the U.S. government, to confiscate the U.S. properties,

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.800
 identified him as an illegal foreign agent,

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.800
 but that didn't take away from their prestige or power,

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:33.800
 because Roosevelt himself was a great admirer of Mussolini,

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:39.800
 even after he took office he was saying what a great statesman Mussolini was.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:45.800
 And so fascism wasn't a bad word until they needed to go to war on the side of England

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:51.800
 to save the British Empire because Hitler had double-crossed the West,

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.800
 and he wanted to knock out England and take their empire,

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.800
 where the West had figured that he would take over the Soviet Union,

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.800
 and then the British Empire and the American Empire could expand.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.800
 Well, going back to saying the Dulles brothers shaped the current predicament we're in,

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.800
 do you see authoritarianism as a pathology?

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:19.800
 Like this is basically a sickness, and people are imposing their sickness.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.800
 Is that a good way of looking at it?

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:29.800
 Yeah, in a sense. A philosopher I think would say it's a sickness of method or of conclusions,

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:35.800
 but if you look at it historically, Parmenides and Plato and Hegel,

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.800
 all of these people were part of the ruling class,

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.800
 and it was the purpose of their thinking that way,

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.800
 even though that probably seemed spontaneous and truthful to them,

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.800
 it happened to be that it was a way of defining who deserves power

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:59.800
 and defining their class as an eternal, justified controller of property and power.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.800
 The idea of class was very conscious in most of history,

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.800
 and in the 20th century, one of the tricks of the ruling class

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.800
 has been to teach the public that there are no classes in America.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.800
 I had a professor in graduate school when I was in 1959 or 60

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.800
 talking about the effect of class in literature.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:31.800
 He interrupted me to say, "In America, we have no classes."

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:39.800
 It's truly either a mental disease or defect of some sort for people to grow up and study

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.800
 and be able to say something like that.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:47.800
 It's because the ruling class learned to manipulate language

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.800
 and control the people that they need to be controlled.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:56.800
 They don't want to necessarily define them as useless rubbish,

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.800
 which they believe they are, unless they can get away with it.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:05.800
 But if they can make the people feel that they are equals with the royalty

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:11.800
 and keep them happy while they're living like garbage, that's the best thing for them.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.800
 So they have taught people that in America there are no classes.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:21.800
 People who are really in the bottom 30 or 40% of income call themselves middle class,

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.800
 and people who are more or less in the middle income range

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.800
 think of themselves as being in the upper 5% or such.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:38.800
 Everyone seems to have this sort of escalated delusion of where they are in the social hierarchy.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.800
 It almost seems like any movement is infiltrated by authoritarianism.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.800
 For example, even your own work, I'm sure to your complete horror,

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.800
 people use that in an authoritarian sense.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:55.800
 Is the environment essentially bracketing our current progress as a civilization right now,

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.800
 or how do you look at it?

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.800
 Yeah, environment in every sense.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.800
 There are penalties of many sorts for getting out of it,

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.800
 and rewards of various kinds for reinforcing it.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.800
 I first heard about Nicole Foss' ideas of degrowth.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.800
 I think you forwarded that to somebody through email once,

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.800
 and I thought it was extremely interesting.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.800
 Do you think there will be an inevitable, as she would call it, degrowth in our society

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.800
 and moving back to a simpler direction?

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:30.800
 No. There will be a rejection or loss of much of the trashy part of our culture,

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:37.800
 but there is no need to go as far as she suggests going back to isolated tribalism.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:44.800
 What's unifying, what's creating the one-worldism at present

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.800
 is a really degraded sort of concept of human interaction

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.800
 and the interaction between people and their environment.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:59.800
 It's all based on this polluted kind of philosophy or religion.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:06.800
 It's a religion of emptiness and abstraction that is telling people that this is all there is.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.800
 But leaving out all of these promotional, consumerist, economic functions,

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.800
 if you simply stop having wars and stop crooked advertising

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.800
 and stop promoting consumerism through schools

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.800
 and the way university research is directed and funded,

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.800
 if you simply stop the craziest practices,

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.800
 what will be left will still be international,

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:39.800
 but without suppressing the individual flavor of ethnicities and so on.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:47.800
 The natural interactions and trade, I think, will keep a unified world economy existing

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.800
 without, even if Tofs is right about the peak oil,

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:57.800
 my opinion is that the world is creating petroleum about as fast as it's being used

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:02.800
 and it just takes a while to refill the wells after they're pumped out.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.800
 But even if she was right, there are alternative sources of power

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:12.800
 that can keep a really high-level culture going more or less permanently.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:19.800
 At present, I think it's something about a dozen species being extincted every day.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.800
 That's an idea of what progress means in this current period.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:30.800
 And if you stop that kind of progress, it's like you stop falling into a hole.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:36.800
 And as soon as you stop falling, then you can see what kind of possibility is really there.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:42.800
 So increasing the people's knowledge, ability, and power could restrain the authority of power?

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.800
 Yeah, making people conscious of the lies that they're having imposed on them.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:54.800
 That involves things as drastic as the saying that most of the theoretical physics

00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:01.800
 that we're taught to admire has been very, very clever technical adaptations

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:08.800
 with a gigantic, fraudulent hierarchy of mathematical theories built on that.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:16.800
 A little bit of empirical technical stuff has been given a mythic sort of importance

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.800
 because it's used economically and in war.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:26.800
 But the implications in theory I don't think are at all what we're being told

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.800
 by the theoretical physicists in Europe and America.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.800
 Obviously you focus a lot on food.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:38.800
 Do you think that's a way in to shift the consciousness of the people towards lower serotonin

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.800
 if that relates to somebody's authoritarianism?

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.800
 Yeah, first a person who is chronically sick and malnourished

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.800
 just doesn't have much energy or stamina to study and be critical.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.800
 So first you just have to stop poisoning yourself by eating what the government

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.800
 and dieticians are selling as a healthful diet.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:09.800
 And once you have the strength to read and think, then you realize who is doing what to you.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.800
 And you start investigating the food industry, the agricultural production industry,

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:20.800
 the science industry that supports the agricultural imposition,

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:27.800
 and the political system that justifies the medical and agricultural economic imposition.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:35.800
 All of these are very clearly wound together in a system to maintain class dominance.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.800
 It's very healthful to eat lobster once in a while,

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.800
 but you don't see dieticians or the government recommending that.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:49.800
 It started in the 1930s depression with the government having a three-tiered diet.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.800
 One to prevent starvation in the very poor,

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.800
 one an economical diet to get along on very little,

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.800
 and then at the top a healthy diet.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:07.800
 And if you look at the bare survival and economic minimal diet of the Great Depression,

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:15.800
 the dieticians in the 1960s and 70s adopted those survival diets as the healthy diet.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.800
 Lots of beans and grains as the basic diet.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.800
 Do you think that was on purpose in a form of control?

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.800
 Yeah, part of it was that the government had been buying milk,

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:35.800
 dehydrating it, making cheese and butter to keep American farmers working to support the prices.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:41.800
 So they were warehousing huge amounts of powdered milk, cheese, and butter,

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.800
 and giving them away first as foreign aid,

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:51.800
 and then the precursor to food stamps was to have, I think, every month,

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:56.800
 a giveaway to poor people of cheese, eggs, powdered milk, and so on.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:05.800
 And in the 70s, there was a big movement to stop helping the poor people in other countries,

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.800
 as well as the poor at home.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:13.800
 And one of the arguments that came up in the pseudoscientific dietetic community

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:19.800
 was that people outside the United States hardly ever can tolerate lactose,

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.800
 so you should stop giving them powdered milk.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:29.800
 And that argument against people, only certain white people can tolerate lactose,

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:36.800
 that was heavily promoted as a racist change of foreign policy against foreign aid and food aid in general.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:43.800
 Sending them beans was okay, except we didn't need to support the price of American beans that way.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.800
 Do you think this tendency to be authoritarian, or as Altameyer would have said,

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.800
 right-wing authoritarian, even though it's a semi-confusing term,

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.800
 do you personally see it more in Americans versus other places?

00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:03.800
 I know you've mentioned Mexico as a different type of environment and being a little more cheerful.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:08.800
 Do you think that's largely because of the history of the U.S. and how things got flushed out?

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:15.800
 A lot of it is the specific policy choices of the government and corporations

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.800
 indoctrinating Americans in a certain way.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:27.800
 And one of my main criticisms of Bob Altameyer is that he has focused on the right-wing authoritarianism,

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:34.800
 and it would be okay to call it right-wing if you define right in the sense of the fascism

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:40.800
 that Winston Churchill and FDR subscribed to.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.800
 Americans generally think of FDR as an extreme leftist president,

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:52.800
 but definitely his admiration for Mussolini says there was no leftism at all.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.800
 He said what he was doing was saving his class, saving the ruling class,

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.800
 because there was such a threat of revolution in the United States.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:09.800
 So he was saving capitalism, and that would, I think, fit in as, you could say, modified fascism.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:15.800
 It was an inventive way of keeping the corporations lightly out of sight,

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:23.800
 letting them buy the various regulatory agencies, but keeping them out of the executive for their own good.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.800
 He was fixing the economy with Keynesian economics,

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.800
 which the people who organized a coup in 1933 to get him out,

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:39.800
 they considered even the borrowing and spending to be a communist plot of government.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:46.800
 They wanted to get Roosevelt out, but what he was doing was using finance to prevent revolution.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:55.800
 And immediately the Dulleses, when it came out that Alan Dulles was working closely with the Nazis at the end of World War II,

00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:01.800
 Stalin informed Roosevelt that his spies were aware that Dulles was collaborating with the Nazis,

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:09.800
 and Roosevelt, his comments suggested that he thought maybe Stalin had gone crazy to tell him such a thing.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:15.800
 But within two or three days, Roosevelt surely would have found out that Stalin was right,

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:21.800
 and that would have put Dulles in line for the war crimes trials.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:26.800
 But luckily for Dulles, right at that moment, Roosevelt chose to die,

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.800
 saving Dulles from criminal treason prosecution.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:38.800
 And the powers in the Democratic Party who had connections both with Adolf Hitler

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:44.800
 and with the DuPont gang that had organized the 1933 coup attempt,

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:49.800
 they were in charge of the big city Democratic Power Party machine.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:58.800
 And they knew that Harry Truman had expressed himself many times as wanting Hitler to go fight the Soviets.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:06.800
 And since that was the preferred American policy, they had installed him as vice president in 1944.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:11.800
 And so Roosevelt's death in '45 not only saved Dulles,

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:17.800
 but it put Truman in position to continue the pro-Nazi policy.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:24.800
 - I have a project paperclip where the top Germans were not only helped move to Argentina and adjoining countries,

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.800
 but a lot of them were brought to the US, the scientists in particular.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.800
 - It seems like Dulles was involved in a lot of sketchy stuff like MKUltra,

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.800
 and I know you've talked about LSD and its effects on the physiology,

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.800
 and that somewhere somebody said that LSD made you crazy and they outlawed it.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:48.800
 Do you see him as an integral part of suppressing, I don't know if I want to call it the drug culture,

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.800
 but that specific substance?

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:56.800
 - Oh, for sure. One of the people who invented the idea of communist brainwashing,

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:03.800
 saying that when prisoners of war had confessed their crimes and wanted to stay with the enemy,

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.800
 he said that proves that they've got amazing powers of brainwashing.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:15.800
 And I think it was two or three days after a big speech on that, he approved the MKUltra project

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:22.800
 for testing LSD and other drugs to see if they could wipe out a person's moral restrictions

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.800
 and give complete power over them.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:31.800
 - Do you see the disestablishment of medicine as a central tower to turn over,

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:36.800
 to enable the people to resist the authoritarian ideas imposed on us?

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:42.800
 - Yeah, for example, you could still have very strong government control,

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:47.800
 but if it was rationalized so that, for example, a person had to pass a test,

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:52.800
 had to know certain empirical facts before they could get a license,

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:59.800
 they would have to know something about blood circulation and how respiration works and such things

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.800
 so that they wouldn't inject things into the wrong part of the patient.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:08.800
 But with just a reasonable control, you could open up the whole field

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:13.800
 so that you would have not only more accessible medicine, but also better medicine.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:18.800
 It would give people a choice between rational and irrational treatment.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:24.800
 - If you were thinking of an optimal society, would it include medicine or government at all?

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.800
 I guess I'm interested in your position on that.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:37.800
 - Tolstoy and Kropotkin are my oldest political influences, I think, people who had explicit ideas.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:45.800
 And one of Tolstoy's lines was that a person should be ashamed to use government power.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:54.800
 If you have an organization that has deleted for maybe five years or ten years,

00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:04.800
 if you have simply deleted the threats and the craziness that presently is saturating our culture,

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:11.800
 I think you would very easily have a powerless society that would function without visible power.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:21.800
 There's a town in Andalusia, Spain, which I think was 1989 they elected an anarchist mayor.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:26.800
 And it's just an amazing town.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.800
 They've reelected him ever since.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:34.800
 And they gradually, piece by piece, expropriated unused land.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:40.800
 And within just a very few years of his first election, they had eliminated poverty,

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:46.800
 eliminated the town police, and had everything cleaned up.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.800
 And that's still going now 25 or 30 years later.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:58.800
 I think that's an example of how any place can work if you just remove the most horrible, oppressive parts of the system.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.800
 - We'd probably end there, but Ray, thank you so much.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.800
 That was amazing.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:09.800
 Not for the podcast, essentially, but I'm actually--this is the end of my stay in San Francisco.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.800
 I'm going to head to San Miguel de Allende on July 1st.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.800
 I thought I'd mention that.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.800
 I think Sequiris, is that the artist that you enjoy there?

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.800
 I think some of his big stuff is there.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.800
 - Oh, yeah.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:26.800
 I don't think he ever finished a mural in San Miguel.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.800
 I've always wanted to see that.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:33.800
 I heard about the process of starting it and the conflicts that interrupted it.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:39.800
 - Awesome. Yeah, I'll send you a picture because the prices in San Francisco are just too crazy right now.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.800
 - Okay.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.800
 - Thank you so much again, Ray.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.800
 Total pleasure.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.800
 I appreciate your time.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.800
 This should be up probably in one or two weeks because of the move.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.800
 But again, I appreciate it.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.800
 Thank you, and I'll talk to you soon.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.800
 - Okay, great. Thank you.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.800
 - Okay, bye, Ray.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.800
 - Bye.
