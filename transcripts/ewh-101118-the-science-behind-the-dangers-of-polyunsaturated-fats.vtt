00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.700
 Love, Hope, Radio.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:44.900
 You're listening to Holistic Living, brought to you by EastWest Healing and Performance.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.900
 And now, here are your hosts, Josh and Jeanne Rubin.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.400
 Hey everyone, this is Josh Rubin and Jeanne from Holistic Living.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.700
 What happened, we gotta get Ray P on, obviously this is what our show is about.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.000
 And we have to call him in because he doesn't have long distance.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.700
 So the first couple of minutes you gotta be with us, because we've run into some technical difficulties.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.100
 So I'm gonna get Jeanne to actually get him on.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.300
 So you're gonna hear me for two seconds talking to her.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:25.000
 What you're gonna do is basically call him, no, call into the show, and then go to "Join Conference".

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.500
 Dial that number, and he should come on. And you should both be on, let me know if you're in trouble.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 Alright, so today we're gonna talk about Ray P.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.300
 I'm gonna let him introduce himself, because the guy's a researcher, an educator, an artist, you name it.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.700
 And a lot of what he teaches and preaches definitely goes against the grain.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.700
 So, and hopefully we can get him on the show, because I'm gonna be really disappointed.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.300
 I thought I had this conferencing down pat, but obviously I'm having some technical difficulties with this.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.200
 As I stated before, there's already people calling in. Unfortunately, I'm not gonna take callers,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.800
 only because we only have an hour, he's got a lot to say.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.700
 It's stuff against the grain, and I don't feel like people calling in, starting conflict.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.800
 So if I do have time at the end, we will take callers.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.200
 But as of now, I'm not gonna take callers, unfortunately.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.200
 He's not on, there are some calls, maybe I'll take them, but...

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.200
 Let's just go through some of the jury work.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.800
 Don't forget, as we always say, check out our website, eastwesthealing.com.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.500
 We have tons of free information on there, from YouTubes to our blog, to our BlogTalk Radio.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.800
 Everything we do is free on there, so check it out. It's a wealth of information for yourself, clients.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.900
 You know, we work with clients all over the world, and we have free consultations.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.300
 So feel free to give us a call anytime. All our information is on our website.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.300
 So, let me just take one of the calls before we start, while we're waiting for Rain to come on.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.300
 Let's see. Hello?

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.300
 Hello?

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.600
 You know what happens, guys? I have to be honest with you, I know it's a radio show, it's technology.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.000
 But people call in, and I answer the call, and I don't say anything.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.800
 I have to be honest with you, it totally irritates me.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.000
 So if you're gonna call in, you're gonna be waiting.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.300
 Listen, if I say "Hello?" that means you go, "Oh, hey, here's my question."

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.100
 'Cause if I don't hear anything, I'm gonna just delete you.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.000
 So, let me check in with Jeannie to see where we're at. See if she has him on.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Is that an 8 or a 9?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 That's a...

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.300
 That'd be a...

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.500
 Sorry, guys. It's a 9.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.000
 We're just trying to get him on, 'cause he doesn't have long distance,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.700
 and I thought I had this conference thing down pat.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.200
 Let me know when he's on. I think we might have him.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.500
 Hi, Rain, how are you?

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.500
 Alright, guys. I think I got him.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.200
 [silence]

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.900
 Are you on?

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.000
 Hello, Jeannie?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.500
 Hello.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.900
 -I got it. -Hey, Rain, we got you on the show.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.200
 I got concerned for a second, 'cause I was having trouble dialing in through my host pin,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.400
 but we got you on. Sweet.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.500
 -Okay. -Thanks for joining us today.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.400
 So, today we're going to be talking about polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.600
 And, of course, as you know, you've obviously done way more research on this subject

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.900
 than probably most people. It's quite a...

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.900
 Well, it's quite a controversial topic, because a lot of people are promoting

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.200
 taking these oils or eating these foods. So, I wanted to, you know, on our show,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.700
 get your approach, 'cause we've studied you for years,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.800
 and it's definitely brain twisting for a lot of people.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.800
 There's a lot of people that have a lot of questions.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.600
 We have a lot of questions, and we want to get in as much as we can.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.100
 But I want maybe, if you want, I know you have a history.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.200
 If you want to just give just a brief introduction to kind of who you are,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.700
 and maybe why you do what you do.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:05.500
 Okay. I was starting to study brain physiology in 1968,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.800
 when I went to University of Oregon, and found that the best scientists

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.000
 were working in reproductive physiology.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.500
 And so, even though the brain was my center of interest,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:29.800
 I did my PhD work on reproductive physiology in particularly female aging,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.800
 and studying the effects of estrogen and the changes with aging.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:45.300
 I thought that the old animals actually had more estrogen stimulation in their tissues

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:52.500
 than younger animals, and it was working basically like contraceptive pills

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.000
 to prevent fertility after middle age.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.300
 And I noticed that the uteruses under the influence of aging and estrogen

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.800
 typically were darkened and contained a brown pigment.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:19.000
 And that got me interested in how that pigment develops through aging,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.500
 estrogen excess, or radiation is another thing that can cause it,

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.000
 or deprivation of oxygen.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.500
 So I started studying this pigment, which is called lipofuscin, or age pigment,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:42.500
 and saw that it had been studied quite a lot in the 1930s and 40s.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:51.000
 They found that they were killing their animals by feeding them too much of the seeds

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 that were rich in polyunsaturated fats, or fish in some cases, such as mink,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 were the ones that were being killed by an excess of fish in the diet.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 But even horse meat was killing animals like mink, which were carnivorous.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 And so if the horses had eaten flax or linseed,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 their fat was toxic to the carnivorous animals.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 And in animals that ate too much of the unsaturated fats,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 they developed yellow fat disease, which in mink,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 it developed paralysis fairly quickly of the hindquarters.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 And then it would kill them, and it would turn out that their fat tissue was inflamed

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 and waterlogged, and eventually it would turn yellow or brown.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 And that's the same pigment that appears in the uterus that has been overexposed to estrogen,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 or in the skin of an old person that has been exposed to sunlight.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 And the brain, all the organs develop this pigment with aging,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 but it develops in proportion to the amount of unsaturated fats in the diet.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 And the essential toxic effect of it is that it consumes oxygen

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 even faster than the unoxidized unsaturated fatty acids.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 It acts as an enzyme equivalent, directly wasting energy and oxygen,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 losing some hydrogen peroxide in the process and a variety of toxic effects,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 but oxygen wasting is really an essential factor.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 It also poisons in more direct ways the respiratory enzymes

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 and the cellular cleanup systems, the proteolytic enzymes that should remove defective proteins.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 And that's seen in the brain of Alzheimer's patients.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 They accumulate a lot of these highly unsaturated oils such as EPA and DHA,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 and in the process these fats inactivate the enzymes which should remove the toxic proteins

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 such as the prion protein that is associated with all of the brain degenerative diseases.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 And similar things have different effects in different tissues.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 In cancer, for example, the proteolytic enzymes are also inhibited,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 but cancer cells have a pretty strong defense against lipid peroxidation.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 So it takes a very high level of lipid peroxide to kill cancer cells

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 where it will damage heart cells and brain cells very easily.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 So we kind of jumped ahead, which is good because that's what people want to hear about

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 because a lot of people want to know about these fats.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 I want to just rewind it a little so people understand,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 well there's more than three, but our body kind of, or our diets consist of proteins, carbs and fats.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 We're going to be talking about more on fats, but maybe just for the lay listener,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 can you explain the role of proteins and carbs and fats in the body before we go into the poofers?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Well, the basic structure of the body is built of proteins,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 and the function of the protein is partly to produce energy and to replicate itself,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 but the functional and structural proteins are the reason we have to eat protein constantly.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 The fats, we can synthesize our own saturated and unsaturated fats.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 When we synthesize the highly unsaturated fats ourselves from eating either sugar or protein,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 the longer unsaturated fats are called mead acid and the derivatives of that.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 And the sugars are able to produce energy and so make it unnecessary to convert protein to energy,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 but in the absence of sugar or fat, we can easily convert protein into fat and sugar to produce energy.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Right.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 So obviously we're going to be talking more about fats.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 This is kind of the source of why we're here.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 You kind of just talked about their role.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Why do you think there's such a misconception about healthy versus non-healthy fats?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 The misconception started very quickly in the 1940s when the agricultural chemists found that they could fatten their animals faster

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 if they poisoned their metabolic systems with an antithyroid drug and they would get fat on very little food.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 Then that turned out to leave a carcinogenic residue in the meat,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 so they found out that corn and soy beans contained these polyunsaturated fats

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 that would suppress the respiration of the animals and make them get fat on very little food.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 But in the process, they found that they were getting these yellow fat disease and brain degeneration,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 degeneration of the gonads, infertility and so on.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 The function of vitamin E in the 1930s had been identified as an anti-estrogen,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 but I mentioned that estrogen accelerates the breakdown of these fats.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 They saw a connection between excess estrogen and excess polyunsaturated fats

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 and began using vitamin E as an antioxidant rather than an anti-estrogen.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 So the new definition of vitamin E became very important

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 because the agricultural industry was turning to the very fattening diet of high polyunsaturated oil

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 for foods such as corn and soy beans.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 So to protect against the very toxic effects that killed their animals prematurely,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 they would use vitamin E, and so it became known as an antioxidant rather than an anti-estrogen.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 And the medical people noticed that cholesterol was lowered in the process

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 of eating a lot of these polyunsaturated fats,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 and that led to the spreading of the marketing of unsaturated fats to the human food supply

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 rather than just for the fattening farm animals.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 And since people didn't want to gain weight on the least amount of food,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 they needed a new reason for selling their fats to humans,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 and lowering cholesterol became the excuse in humans.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 But the agriculturists knew all through the 1940s that the corn and soy oils were very fattening

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 and eventually very toxic, but since they sold their animals as soon as they reached a marketable size,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 they didn't care if they died later.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 They were killing them before they had a chance to die of the degenerative diseases.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 So nowadays when we're talking about fats,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 I think a lot of people have misconceptions about what fats are in our diet.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Maybe could you give us just what your thoughts are and what the fats are in the current diet today?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 People are still talking about essential fatty acids as if they were almost a vitamin.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 When I was a kid in school, whenever nutritionists would mention the unsaturated fatty acids,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 they would say possibly essential or mentioning a controversy as to whether they were essential or not.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 In 1929, two researchers working for the agricultural industry, the Burrs,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 claimed that the linoleic acid and linoleic acid, which are now called the essential fatty acids,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 that they were essential nutrients.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Previously, several researchers had demonstrated that animals could live perfectly without those

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 if they were given vitamin-rich food, protein-rich food.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 In fact, some German researchers found that animals didn't develop cancer,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 something like 99% of cancers didn't develop when animals were deprived of linoleic and linoleic acids.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 But the Burrs ignored the previous existing evidence that these fats are not essential.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 They produced skin disease and gonadal defects when they deprived the animals of these two fatty acids.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 But at that time, only two of the B vitamins were known.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 About three years later, one of these researchers put one of his fatty acid-deficient rats in a chamber

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 to measure its oxygen consumption and found that when it was deficient in essential fatty acids,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 it was metabolizing 50% faster than normal, burning calories at a tremendous rate.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 And so its nutrition requirements were very high,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 but they were giving it just the same diet that they would feed ordinary animals.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 And in the 1940s, the Burrs never followed up on the meaning of that,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 but in the 1940s, researchers found that vitamin B6 deficiency causes exactly the symptoms

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 that were blamed on the linoleic acid deficiency.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 So they fed their animals the diet that the Burrs had used to demonstrate the so-called essentiality

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 and created the symptoms that the Burrs had produced.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 Then they gave the animals only extra vitamin B6 and cured the condition.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 So what the Burrs had demonstrated was that the essential fatty acids slow metabolism,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 making them need less food, and so prevented a deficiency on a deficient diet.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 But given a diet without those fats but with adequate vitamin B6, there were no symptoms produced.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 But when the oil industry wanted to market their products, the metabolism suppressing fatty acids,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 they simply ignored the fact that the Burrs' work had been totally invalidated.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 And now 70 years later, 80 years later, they're still citing the work of the Burrs

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 as the evidence that fatty acids, linoleic and linoleic, are essential.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 But now for 65 years, it's been perfectly established that they are not essential.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 Right. Yeah, I mean, it's like... Go ahead, Jeannie. Go ahead.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 That's okay, Josh.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 Go ahead.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 I was going to ask, besides omega-3, which is linoleic acid, and omega-6, which is the linoleic acid,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 for the listeners, where else in our food supply do we consume these polyunsaturated fatty acids?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 I didn't hear the last part of your question.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 I was saying, besides the omega-3s and the omega-6s, for the purpose of the show and the listeners,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 where else in our food supply do we consume these polyunsaturated fatty acids?

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 Oh, well, all natural foods contain small amounts of some of the polyunsaturated fats,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 like coconut oil contains about 1%, and beef, lamb, milk, and cheese contain a couple percent,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 depending on what they ate.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 But the really risky sources, for example, when you get above the equivalent of about a teaspoonful

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 of the polyunsaturated fats per day for a person, four grams a day is where the breakdown of these

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 fats starts showing an increased incidence of cancer and other degenerative diseases.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 And if you don't specialize in the foods that are naturally low in those fatty acids,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 you increase your risk of all of the toxic or degenerative influences.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 And the foods that are richest in these unstable and potentially toxic oils are grains, seeds, nuts,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 vegetables in general, and all of the animals which are not ruminants, which have eaten the vegetable

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 polyunsaturated fats, so that horses, rabbits, chickens, which are not ruminants, will reflect in their diet.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Pigs will reflect in their diet pretty exactly what they've been eating as they grew up.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 And fish eat algae and smaller organisms that have eaten algae and get a very high concentration

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 of these polyunsaturated fats.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Right. So most people, I would assume there's a lot of practitioners and average people listening,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 people are overdoing seeds or overdoing nuts, and I don't think people realize,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 if you're reading yourself, why the seeds of the plants produce these polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 And when you say vegetables, could you be a little bit more specific just for the listeners

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 so they have an understanding when you say vegetables, you're talking above ground, below ground,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 you're talking green?

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 Yeah. If you think of where corn normally grows or soybeans in, say, Iowa,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 the corn produces its seed and the seed sits on the ground for a few months during the winter

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 and sprouts, has to begin sprouting when the weather is still fairly cool,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 so that the seed is basically kept in refrigeration all through the winter.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 And then when it starts warming up a little, it sprouts and produces new plant.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 And it contains enough vitamin E that under this refrigerated situation,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 these polyunsaturated fats are stable enough that then the seed is still alive.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 But if you kept the seed warm all winter at, say, the temperature of a human body,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 these oils would react with oxygen and the seed would be dead by springtime.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 And since the enzymes have to become active when the temperature is maybe 40 degrees

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 or 50 degrees in the spring, if the oils were completely saturated,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 they would be like butter in the refrigerator at 40 degrees, hard and immobile.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 And so the unsaturated fats are still liquid and mobile at refrigerator temperature.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 If a fish lives at, say, 20 or 30 degrees, they can stand very cold temperatures.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 If they have very polyunsaturated fats, they act as an antifreeze.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 And the fish, if it contains saturated fats, would be stiff like a cube of butter

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 at refrigeration at 40 degree temperature.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 So the organism needs mobile fats, which are stable at low temperatures,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 simply to function at those low temperatures.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 But if you look at the fish in the Amazon River, where the water is up around 90 degrees,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 these fish have fats that are just about as saturated as butter

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 because their unsaturated fats would oxidize and degenerate

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 if they were living at that temperature.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 If you grow soybeans in the tropics, soy oil then is practically as saturated as butter.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 The unsaturation is a defense to maintain mobility on the molecular level,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 but it requires an antioxidant as well as low temperature for the cell to survive

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 using those unstable oils.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 In one experiment when I was studying the effects of these in cells,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 I just put a rubber hose in a bottle of safflower oil and put the other end in a cup of water,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 and you could see the water rising in the rubber hose

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 because the oil was consuming oxygen just like I had an animal in the bottle respiring.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 The oil respires as it degenerates and consumes oxygen.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 And in your body at 98 degrees, that happens even faster than at room temperature.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 So I guess for the listeners, would you agree that just because all that makes sense to some of us,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 but some of the listeners are probably going, "Whoa."

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 So would you say that you are more in favor of vegetables like squashes or root vegetables

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 that have less, we could say very little polyunsaturated fatty acids in them,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 and you're not in favor of vegetables like greens and spinach and lettuce and kale and things like that?

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Yes. The leaves are very good and important sources of magnesium and vitamin K,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 but you have to take into consideration the high proportion of polyunsaturated fats.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 So for calories, squashes and root vegetables are safer as a major source of calories.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 But fruits are even better because the tissue contains a higher concentration of minerals

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 than in the starchy vegetables.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 Okay. Yeah, because based off your work, I think that's really, it's definitely,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 the science is fascinating and it's very challenging for us and I can imagine for the layperson,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 but those are some of the conclusions that we've come to in regards to working with people

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 and with vegetables and getting results.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 So I just wanted to kind of bring that up to the listeners to get an understanding of where you're at.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 Yeah, potatoes are more like a fruit or an animal protein in the total nutritional value,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 even though because they contain practically no fat, it's good to have some kind of animal fat with the potato,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 but some of the roots are very starchy. Potato happens to be a very balanced vegetable.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Right.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 So in regards to the omega-3s, I mean, so many people today think that omega-3s produce

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 non-inflammatory prostaglandins. I kind of want to get your take on that.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 I mean, do we need essential fatty acids to produce prostaglandins to fight inflammation

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 or is that just kind of something that is not so true?

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 Yeah, some of the recent work on the anti-inflammatory effect of the fish oil or the omega-3 fats

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 shows that they accumulate with aging, for example, in the brain,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 and Alzheimer's or dementia patients have a much higher level of these in the brain.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 And they spontaneously oxidize into not only toxic, anti-metabolic, anti-brain tissue substances,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 the neuroprosteins, for example, but in the process of oxidizing, they suppress the immune system, too.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 It's an across-the-board toxic effect, but when you look at the immune system suppressing the cells

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 that produce inflammation, you get an interruption of an existing inflammatory process.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 Several researchers have found that it's only the oxidized form, the broken-down form of the fish oil,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 that has the anti-inflammatory effect. And when you prolong the feeding with this anti-inflammatory effect,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 you start seeing that immunodepression is the longer-range effect.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 And the present extreme advocacy of fish oil for its anti-inflammatory effect

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 is very similar to what the x-ray industry was doing 80 years ago.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 Even as recently as the 1950s and '60s, they were still treating arthritis, acne, psoriasis, ringworm,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 anything with an inflammatory component with x-ray treatment, because its immediate effect

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 is to create these lipid peroxides, which are anti-inflammatory immediately,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 immunosuppressive in the long run, and toxic in many ways eventually.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 So, Ray, if you could tell us - unfortunately, this show is only one hour, and we have about 25 minutes left,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 which is great, but I want to get to more stuff - maybe tell us, for the listeners, because most people say,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 "Well, there's all these diets out there, the Paleo diet, the metabolic type, all these diets,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 and now a lot of what we do is promote, we promote a lot of your work."

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 And people are like, "Well, now you're telling me I can't eat anything. What am I supposed to eat?"

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 So maybe just tell us two things. Can you give us five key points on why you feel poop is so dangerous?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 And maybe some alternative fats we can work into that, some alternative fats that are much more beneficial for our bodies.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Oh, well, olive oil is pretty safe because it has a great variety of antioxidants, even though it's 10% PUFA.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 I recommend not eating more than maybe a couple of teaspoonfuls per day just because of that PUFA content

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 that eventually can build up. But the toxicity of the PUFA will depend on your total calorie intake,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 because if you use it for fuel as fast as you eat it, then it's going to have relatively small harmful effects.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 It's when you put it into storage and let it really decompose and have its long-range effect on your fat tissue

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 and brain tissue, that's when it becomes most harmful.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 Coconut oil has only around 1% or 2% depending on the temperature of where it grows of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 And so coconut oil and butter can actually have an antioxidant effect,

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 blocking the effects of these other breakdown products of the PUFA and can help to clean your tissues of the fats that you ate previously.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 And sugar, from whatever source, but especially from fruits because of the minerals that help to stabilize and organize the metabolism,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 sugar is naturally turned into saturated fats and we immediately create an omega-9 type of fat when we synthesize fat from sugar.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 And this, the mead acid, is produced from any fat that we make ourselves.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 And these go on to make the multiply polyunsaturated fats that are used in a few places.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 And they have an anti-inflammatory effect.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 By avoiding the toxic anti-inflammatory effects, we're allowing our body to produce the natural anti-inflammatory mead acid series of fats or omega-9.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 And that's through the use of the saturated fats?

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 It's really what?

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 Is that through the intake of saturated fats?

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 Saturated, not unsaturated.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 We can produce these from saturated fats such as in cocoa butter, chocolate fat.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 That's stearic acid and we can turn stearic acid into the omega-9 fats.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 So, for the listeners, Ray is promoting the use of saturated fats and not promoting the use of these poofes,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 which is, it goes against all societal belief because I would say 99% of the clients who work with come in,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 they're on cod liver oil, they're pumping fish liver, fish oil into their body.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 And the interesting thing, you know, researching yourself and reading, you talk about poofes and these fatty acids storing in the tissues,

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 which is really interesting if you could elaborate on that and how with the stress reaction or low glucose levels,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 that can actually in itself create hormonal or like hypothyroid-like symptoms.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 Can you elaborate on that for the listeners?

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 Yeah, it's very interesting, but very few people have been researching it,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 that estrogen favors in some way the storage of these polyunsaturated fats and these fats favor the influence of estrogen and activate estrogen.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 So, the thing that got me interested in it in the first place,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 people are still working on that strange mutual effect of estrogen and the polyunsaturated fats.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 But why it happens, I don't think anyone knows.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 When a mammal is born, the brain and all of the tissues are, by the present standards,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 they're deficient in the essential fatty acids because the presence of the meat acid that we synthesize naturally

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 is taken as an indicator of deficiency of the essential fatty acids.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 And the growth of the fetus is inhibited when you try to correct that so-called deficiency

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 by feeding them other increased amounts of either the seed oils or the fish oils.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 The seed oils strongly inhibit our ability to make the meat acid,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 and the fish oils, one good thing about them is that they are less inhibiting of our ability to make meat acid than the seed oils are.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 But when 35 years ago, experimenters fed pregnant mice and other animals various diets with corn oil,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 corn oil versus coconut oil, or chocolate fat versus soy oil and so on,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 they found that the unsaturated fats caused the pregnant animals to have small-brained babies,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 which didn't learn very well.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 And just about a year and a half ago, some French researchers were going to demonstrate

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 that pregnant women who were eating more of the unsaturated fats had smarter babies already developing in their uterus.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 They developed a way to produce a sound and measure the brainwave of the fetus,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 and they were going to demonstrate that the fetuses in the women who ate the unsaturated fats were learning quicker.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 But in fact, they found that they were less able to learn in proportion to the amount of polyunsaturated fat in their diet.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 And when they were born, they turned out to be smaller and to have smaller brains.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 So it was exactly the opposite of what they predicted that they would find,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 but it exactly agreed with what the animal researchers had found 35 years ago.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 One of the marketing tools of the baby formula industry is to say that their product is more like breast milk

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 because they add the omega-3 fats to it.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 And their argument, there have been quite a few experiments measuring the baby's visual acuity,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 and they don't mention that several of the experiments showed that the visual development was slower

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 in the babies that had the polyunsaturated fats.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 But they claim that it accelerates the development of visual acuity,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 and they also don't mention that some studies show that brain damage increases the visual acuity for these grading sensing tests.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 Do you feel that with the elimination of these PUFAs in veggies and oils and increasing in saturated fats,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 that this could actually reverse a lot of the things that we're seeing today with hormonal imbalances

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 and hypothyroidism and immune system distortions and whatnot?

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 And how would that work?

00:43:49.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 About almost 20 years ago, I had been reading and thinking about these ever since 1970 when I was doing my thesis,

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 but I just hadn't done much with my diet.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 I'd stopped using any of the liquid cooking oils or salad oils, but I just hadn't been extreme in my diet.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 But I decided to experiment by adding half an ounce to an ounce of coconut oil to my food.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 And the immediate thing that I noticed was that for about an hour and a half after eating a tablespoon or so of coconut oil,

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 my heart was running at a higher rate and I was breathing harder and my skin was pinker.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 And that went on for several days.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 And after a couple of weeks, I saw that I was losing weight quickly, even though I was eating more calories per day.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 And for about, I guess, 30 years, I had maintained the same weight.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 But after two or three weeks, I saw that I was heading for a lower plateau of weight,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 and I've stayed there ever since.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 Just occasionally adding a tablespoon or so of coconut oil helps activate my thyroid in effect,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 because constantly when we draw on the stored unsaturated fats,

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 in proportion to the unsaturation of the fats circulating in the blood,

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 all functions of our thyroid system are inhibited.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 We produce less hormone.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 We transport it less effectively.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 It enters the mitochondria and nucleus less effectively.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 So if you do anything to interrupt that supply of stored unsaturated fats,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 you immediately, like in 15 minutes, will feel the surge of respiratory activity.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 And hospitals 20 or 30 years ago started using soy oil emulsions to prevent weight loss in cancer patients,

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 and they quickly were seeing that their immune systems were suppressed.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 But within about 15 minutes of putting a dose of the emulsified oil into the bloodstream,

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 their blood sugar went up.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 It immediately impairs the ability to oxidize glucose,

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 and that's a whole line of diabetes research that isn't getting much public attention,

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 but it's called the Randle effect or the Randle cycle.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 This person showed that the immediate effect of the presence of unsaturated fats is to block the oxidation of glucose

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 and chronically then you have the oxidative damage to the mitochondria that cause permanent respiratory defects.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 Interesting stuff.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 It's fascinating that that research is out there and we're still seeing --

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 I mean, people are just eating huge amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 and they're taking huge amounts of these fish oils and carbon oils and whatnot,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 and I just don't understand with it out there why we're still seeing this.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 With so much disease, why are we still seeing this when it's been shown over and over again?

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 There's a lot of money being invested in publicizing their product.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 It always comes back to that, doesn't it?

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 Yeah, everyone is still advertising that their baby formula contains omega minus three,

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 but the couple of little studies that showed that just the fact of putting it in a dehydrated powdered formula,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 you get a tremendous oxidative destruction of the fats,

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 something that you wouldn't get if you ate the same fats in a fish or got it in breast milk.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 So, Ray, we've got about 10 minutes left, and I want to kind of summarize the show

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 and then maybe take a question because, unfortunately, an hour goes by quick,

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 and I honestly could probably talk to you for the next eight hours about this easily.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 But if you could summarize for the listeners, like I said,

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 maybe five points for the listeners on why you don't like the poofs that are in vegetables

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 and these colloborals, for example, because it can lead to mitochondrial issues and fatigue.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 Like some key points that people can walk away with, it's kind of stirring their brain,

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 so they understand, well, maybe this stuff is really not that good for me.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 Yeah, it promotes estrogen's effect and interferes with the synthesis of progesterone

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 and other protective steroids and inhibits thyroid, which really affects everything,

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 including the ratio of estrogen to progesterone. And the chronic effect of the accumulated age pigment

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 is it's one of the powerful motors of aging. The wasting of oxygen is characteristic of stress,

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 aging, poof poisoning, estrogen poisoning, and radiation poisoning.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:20.000
 And it actually makes you more sensitive to any mild radiation exposure.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 The doctors and dentists who are telling the patient that their X-ray doses is minimal

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 neglect even to think about what the diet of the patient has to do with their sensitivity.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 But it has a great effect on how much damage you get from a given dose of X-ray.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 In looking at the historical effects, the publicity picks out only what looks like a good effect,

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 but they neglect that in Japan, for example, the amount of fish in the diet corresponds

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 to several types of cancer, digestive tract cancer, for example.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 And the metastatic cancers of several types are promoted very distinctly by fish oils

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 and omega-3 fats, not only the seed oils and omega-6 fats that have been known to be carcinogenic

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 for 70 or 80 years, but now the omega-3s are known to promote several types of cancer

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 and metastatic cancer. And several brain diseases or degenerative conditions,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 besides Alzheimer's, including Lou Gehrig's disease or ALS, are promoted.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 The actual formation of the prion in any of the prion diseases and Alzheimer's

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 resembles the mad cow disease, but the actual formation of the toxic prion protein

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 is accelerated by the polyunsaturated fats.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 So, for the listeners, I want to maybe... Ray, do you mind taking a call or no?

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
 Sure, any time.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 Okay. So, for the listeners, I've been reading Ray's stuff for probably six years,

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 and it's intense stuff, it's deep, but it's a 180 of everything you learn, let's put it that way,

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 and probably people listening are going, "What? This doesn't make any sense."

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:56.000
 All you can recommend is go to his website, raypeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 He's got, I think, he's got five books, I would start there, they're awesome,

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000
 I've read each one probably six times. He's got tons of articles on his website

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 that are a little bit deeper, but all your questions will be answered in those books

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 and on his articles. So, I highly recommend you reading it, whether you're a layperson or practitioner.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 And the bottom line is, if you read an article, just get ready to read it about six-plus times over

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:28.000
 before you even understand a piece of it, which is awesome.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 So, let's take a call and see what we've got going on here.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 Hello? You're on the air.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 Hello?

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 Hello?

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 Yeah, you got a question for Ray?

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 Yeah, I was just wondering, I'm a pretty big metabolic typing fanatic and I am a protein type

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 and I can't seem to get very many fats other than the fat that comes in meat.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:00.000
 And if I can't, you know, obviously if you're suggesting that maybe these nuts aren't actually good for us,

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 like we've been told, how do you recommend getting the recommended amount of fat in that sense?

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:16.000
 I mean, I take coconut oil on a pretty daily basis, but that's really my only source other than animal fat.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 And I have vegetables here and there, but not very often due to my protein type.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 So, I'm not sure if you're aware of metabolic typing and all that stuff, but that's kind of what I'm asking.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 Well, tropical foods in general are pretty safe.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:41.000
 The nuts that grow at a very high temperature are like coconuts, very saturated in their fats.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 And the reason I recommend tropical fruits is that the small amount of fats in those are highly saturated.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 So, anything that lives or grows at a high temperature is going to be safe when it gets in our body at the same high temperature.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 Okay, cool.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 Cool. Thanks for your question.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 Yeah, thank you.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 I think too, Ray, and I could be wrong, that most people are so influenced by what they learn and what they know,

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 and they get so, and this is just my opinion, they get so caught up in a system that they live by the system,

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 and if they think straight from the system, it's almost like, I don't want to say they make the symptoms up and they're feeling them,

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 but it's almost like they feel like they're going against the tribe per se, like, oh my God,

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 I can't have that because I'm a fast oxidizer metabolic type, and if I eat that, I'm going to feel bad.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 So, when they do, they kind of feel bad.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 And I only say that because we follow metabolic typing for a long time,

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:50.000
 until we started straying and following the approach and kind of just abolished what I learned from other systems to try it,

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 and it's worked amazing, kind of just opening myself up.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:07.000
 Yeah, one of the things I didn't mention at all was the interaction between intestinal toxins and the unsaturated fats,

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 but that's a whole area that's very important, but the leakiness of the intestine is promoted by many things,

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 but it's worse when you are highly unsaturated.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 Right, right. Let me take one more caller and we'll wrap it up.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 Let's see. Hello, you're on the air. You've got to, not to push you along, we've got four minutes.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 You've got to make the question to Ray kind of quick. Are you there? All right, there you go. See you later.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.000
 We'll try this one last guy that's been on the air for a while. Hello, you're on the air.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.000
 Hello, hello? Yeah, you've got to make it a little bit quick. We've got three minutes, so you've got to make it snappy.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.000
 Okay, all right. You can hear me, right? Yeah, go ahead.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 Okay, hey, Ray, how are you doing? Hi.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 I was curious about polyunsaturated fats and the whole temperature thing, and so how do bears do it?

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:24.000
 Bears? Yeah, because they obviously get a lot of poofas, and they're obviously at 98 degrees, and they get a ton of poofas.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000
 I was just wondering if there was any studies or info there.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:38.000
 I think they like to eat lots of berries for fattening up in the fall, but the hibernating,

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 I think their temperature drops quite a bit. Their fat temperature is reduced during the winter.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 With squirrels and other hibernators, they've seen that if they don't let them eat the poofa nuts,

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 if they give them a saturated diet, plenty of carbohydrates, they don't hibernate.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:08.000
 The serotonin that triggers hibernation comes up when you reach a certain point of unsaturation in your fats.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 Yeah. If you read his book, "Generative Anatomy," he talks about that in "Generative Anatomy,"

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.000
 and I think another book of his, he touches upon that, so definitely check it out.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000
 Yeah, that's interesting.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000
 All right. I've got to wrap it up, so I'm sorry I've got to hang up, but I appreciate the questions.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 Okay.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.000
 All right, we've got two minutes left. Like I said, I wish we could keep going.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000
 I'd love to have you on again and maybe continue this, or a lot of people want to know more about the thyroid.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000
 Everyone's asking about sugar, which is a huge topic with you, so I'd love to have you on again,

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:47.000
 maybe in the next coming months, to talk about your take on sugar, but we've got about 60 seconds left.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000
 Is there anything you want to add before we have to wrap it up?

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000
 No.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:59.000
 Okay. Well, we really appreciate you taking time out to come on our show,

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:06.000
 and just want you to know we really value your work and everything you put out,

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:11.000
 and we try to promote it as much as we can, not only promoting it, but using it with ourselves and our clients.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
 So we just want to say thank you.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
 Great. Thank you.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000
 Thank you so much.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000
 Thank you, Ray. Have a great day.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000
 Okay. Bye.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000
 Bye-bye.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000
 Bye.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000
 All right, guys. There was the long-anticipated show with Ray.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.000
 Of course, 60 minutes, definitely not long enough to talk about a huge subject.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000
 He's got a lot to say, and a lot of it for people is mind-bending,

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:41.000
 but the goal is you have a little bit of an outline of what he thinks and why these things are bad for us.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
 We can't tell you everything, right?

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.000
 As I've said before, like Charles Polican says, "What am I, a fucking librarian?"

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:53.000
 So if you want to do the research, go to his website, buy his books, and just start diving into this,

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 because I can tell you that from using his work, it's had a profound effect on our lives and our clients' lives.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
 So thanks for tuning in. We'll check you later.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
 We've got new shows coming in January.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
 We're not going to do any in December, so tune in.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
 We're going to do homeopathy, more emotional stuff, and have Ray on again.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
 So thanks for tuning in.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
 Thanks, guys.
