00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:47.440
 - Okay, hello everybody.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.440
 Welcome to the show.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.440
 I just interrupted Ray

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.440
 and he was talking about the CIA and art.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.440
 Ray, go ahead and reiterate or say whatever you were

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.440
 gonna say before I interrupted you.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:01.440
 - Oh, just that the traditions in painting

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.440
 had accumulated lots of knowledge

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.440
 from the time of Michelangelo

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:13.440
 and the older, older so-called classical paintings.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.440
 They had been learning actual physical principles

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.440
 about light and geometry and teaching their art students

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:34.440
 sort of an aspect of physics

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.440
 to use in representing the world.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.440
 And then the first world war,

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:47.440
 the Dada surrealist reaction and Freudianism

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:53.440
 rejected the whole so-called rational system

00:25:53.440 --> 00:26:01.440
 that created such terrible things as the world war.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:08.440
 And that went with a lot of experimentation

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:13.440
 in both the arts and sciences and humanities

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.440
 trying out different things

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.440
 and Hitler closed all of the experimental art schools

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:29.440
 and descending science programs and such.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:35.440
 But right during and after the second world war,

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:42.440
 the CIA created the thing they called

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.440
 Congress for Cultural Freedom

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:50.440
 in which they imposed that revolutionary

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:55.440
 attitude towards painting,

00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:00.440
 destroying the old because of its connection

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.440
 to the corrupt system.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:09.440
 But they put it out as the glory of Western culture,

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.440
 of freedom and Siqueiros,

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.440
 the Mexican painter called it ghost art

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:25.440
 imposed by the Rockefellers to destroy consciousness,

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:32.440
 abstract expressionism, for example,

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:37.440
 all of the abstract approaches to art

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.440
 and the activities of the CIA

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.440
 through the Cultural Freedom Foundation

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:53.440
 shamed and expelled from the universities

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:58.440
 the traditional people who preserved

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.440
 the great tradition in painting

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.440
 so that a whole generation of painters

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.440
 in the universities didn't learn how to paint at all.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:19.440
 We're just now beginning to come out of that phase

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:24.440
 where the whole culture was deliberately being destroyed

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:31.440
 and rerouted down the Rockefeller ghost art route

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.440
 to destroy actual understanding.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:43.440
 I see Noam Chomsky's linguistics

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:48.440
 so-called as being one of the most powerful

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.440
 examples of that.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.440
 Real linguistics had developed

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.440
 with Franz Boas and his students

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:04.440
 and they had created descriptions

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:11.440
 understanding of a great variety of language and culture

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:20.440
 that sort of a peak idea was the Horafian hypothesis

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:25.440
 showing the absolute interaction

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:30.440
 between conceptual understanding of the world

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.440
 and how the language is structured.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:38.440
 And that was a way of understanding

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:43.440
 the role of language behind science and art and culture,

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:50.440
 the way that language can propagandistically

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.440
 destroy understanding of reality.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:59.440
 That was part of the real tradition of linguistics.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:06.440
 At MIT with Pentagon funding,

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.440
 the trend under Noam Chomsky

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.440
 was to throw out everything that was real

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.440
 in the linguistics tradition

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:22.440
 and substitute mysticism based views

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.440
 of consciousness in which words

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:33.440
 are essentially determined by genes.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:41.440
 It's a long story that many historians of language

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.440
 have looked back on it and pointed out

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.440
 that his so-called generative linguistics,

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.440
 generative grammar couldn't generate anything

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.440
 and wasn't a grammar.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.440
 It was a total fraud, but school textbooks,

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:13.440
 high school books incorporated his ideas

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.440
 and supposedly since it described language production

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:25.440
 in terms of a language apparatus

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.440
 which is genetically determined,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:33.440
 supposedly learning his so-called linguistics

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:39.440
 would make it easier to understand the English language

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.440
 or whatever language you're studying.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.440
 And they actually sold those books

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.440
 to school boards across the country.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:51.440
 Absolutely destructive, not only useless,

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:58.440
 but destroying a consciousness of how language really works.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:04.440
 So when he got famous for his anti-imperialism,

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:08.440
 the world just sort of politely forgot

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.440
 how fraudulent his linguistics work had been.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.440
 Do you think that he--

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:18.440
 Fraudulent in the direction of opening

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:24.440
 the philosophical world to accept whatever

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:32.440
 the Pentagon and CIA wanted to substitute for consciousness.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.440
 Do you suspect he was working under the direction

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.440
 of anybody specific?

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:43.440
 No, I think he was one of the originators

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:48.440
 having grown up studying mysticism,

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.440
 it blended right into, I think he believed

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:58.440
 in that mystical idea that there is no consciousness

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:04.440
 other than words, which in a fairly recent video

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.440
 he was explaining that dogs can't think,

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:12.440
 animals can't think because they don't have words.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:19.440
 But he said, I forget, canine or dog, he spelled out,

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.440
 he said if they heard me say dogs,

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.440
 they would get excited and think we were going somewhere.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.440
 So he was saying dogs don't have consciousness

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:37.440
 because they don't have words, but then he had to spell out

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.440
 the word because he didn't want to get the dogs excited.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:46.440
 Are you going to say something, Georgie?

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.440
 Oh, Georgie, your audio.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.440
 I think you're muted, Georgie.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.440
 Sorry, can you hear me now?

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.440
 Yeah, now you're good.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.440
 Yeah, so weren't the experiments in North Carolina

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.440
 with deaf and mute people that the state thought

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.440
 they were, I guess using Chomsky's theory,

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.440
 they thought that these were complete cretins

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.440
 that had like no consciousness, no feelings, no mind,

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.440
 and they actually forcibly sterilized them.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.440
 And then later on, somebody did IQ tests on those people

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.440
 and turned out that they're perfectly intelligent.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.440
 So doesn't that invalidate Chomsky's theory directly?

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:26.440
 How is history connected because of their speech?

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.440
 Yeah, exactly. So these people had no language, right?

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.440
 They were born deaf and mute and all they could do basically

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.440
 is like, I mean, they had sign language,

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.440
 which eventually they learned, but initially

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.440
 they had no language and all they had is perception

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.440
 and visual perception and tactile perception.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:49.440
 And when a psychiatrist did IQ tests on them,

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.440
 turned out that some of them were like slightly behind,

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.440
 but most of them had normal intelligence.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.440
 So it's difficult to argue that Chomsky was right

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.440
 because this directly proves even in humans,

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.440
 people with no language are perfectly capable

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.440
 of conscious experience.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:10.440
 Yeah, everything in reality falsifies Chomsky.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:15.440
 Why is this guy still a tenured professor at MIT then?

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.440
 Is it just inertia?

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:26.440
 Well, at the same time, he was creating his anti-linguistics,

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:32.440
 anti-science doctrine of generative grammar.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:41.440
 One of his students said that even though the press

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.440
 all through the US was saying Chomsky has explained

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.440
 how the brain creates language,

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:55.440
 he in person said when he says generate,

00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:00.440
 he means it in a mathematical sense of account for.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:06.440
 He was knowing that people were being misled,

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:12.440
 that he was aware that it wouldn't actually generate anything

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.440
 that was useless for that purpose.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.440
 But at the same time he was doing that,

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:26.440
 Norbert Wiener with his more holistic approach

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:33.440
 to cybernetics, non-digital, analog approach,

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:41.440
 he was present at MIT, but because he criticized war,

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:47.440
 wouldn't take money from the Pentagon, he was ostracized.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:54.440
 Chomsky was glad to receive funding from the Pentagon.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:37:04.440
 He was a supporter of a Pentagon rocket man

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:13.440
 to be the chancellor of MIT, very close to the Pentagon,

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.440
 powered and taking their money,

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:26.440
 and being in a way the Pentagon's pet anti-imperialist.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:31.440
 Chomsky used to be a close associate,

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.440
 if not even a friend of Marvin Minsky,

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.440
 one of the creators of the AI movement.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.440
 And I think where Minsky greatly disagreed

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.440
 with Chomsky's theory that language is genetically determined

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.440
 because Minsky said, listen, if that's the case,

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.440
 we should have been able by now to create an algorithm

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.440
 that would allow a computer to generate and learn a language de novo.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.440
 And we miserably failed every time we tried.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.440
 - Yeah, that's what Chomsky led the public to believe he had.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:05.440
 But a couple of times when I was teaching linguistics,

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:13.440
 nationally known linguists would go around basically propagandizing.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.440
 And when they would come to my class to talk,

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:24.440
 I would have a chance to explain what was wrong with Chomsky's thing.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:31.440
 I pointed out that you can create a sentence

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:39.440
 if you pick out the right system, right series of his rules,

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:45.440
 you can create a sentence in any language in the world.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:51.440
 But only if you know what the sentence is you want to produce

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:56.440
 to know what series to choose your rules in.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:02.440
 You can't make a sentence that you don't know already applying his rules.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:08.440
 The choice of the rules has to be guided by the finished sentence.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:13.440
 And a couple of them actually understood the concept.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:18.440
 You can see that they only took them a couple of minutes to forget it.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:24.440
 - In one of your articles you said that the real structure of language is images based on images.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:29.440
 So if I understand this correctly, language comes after perception,

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.440
 just like anything else in this world.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.440
 So if language is based on images,

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:37.440
 is the fundamental structure of language based in physical brain structure,

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.440
 which always changes with time and experience?

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:48.440
 - Yeah, the brain structure as formed by interaction with the world.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:55.440
 - So in other words, metabolic rate, which greatly influences changes in brain structure,

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.440
 it may be the ultimate determinant in the evolution of language.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:05.440
 - Yeah, you can analyze language.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:11.440
 Someone looked at letters that nuns had written in their 20s,

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.440
 and then they knew the outcome.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:21.440
 And those who developed Alzheimer's at a relatively young age,

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:28.440
 they could see that their language structure in their 20s was simplified.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:35.440
 And at a young age with a lot of mental energy,

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:45.440
 the language structure is extremely complex and unique.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:54.440
 Every situation demands a fundamental rethinking of the whole thing.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:00.440
 And so there is real uniqueness in everything a healthy person says.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:09.440
 And when the mental energy is lower, what you get is strings of cliches.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:18.440
 - So basically the ability to turn experiences into language depends on the metabolic rate vitally.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.440
 - Yeah.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:29.440
 - And the summation of that is Chomsky was too addicted to the MIT Epstein money to change his ways.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.440
 - To change his what?

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.440
 - Change his ways, change his theories. He was too committed to them.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.440
 I'm just joking.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:40.440
 Didn't Epstein work at MIT?

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.440
 - Oh, not that I've heard of.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:49.440
 Oh, yeah, just a little while before he was notorious,

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:55.440
 he was funding one of their programs,

00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:01.440
 and the guy who accepted his funding was embarrassed and quit.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.440
 - I think him and Minsky collaborated on a few things,

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:10.440
 or at least Epstein sponsored some of Minsky's research.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:15.440
 At least that's what I saw recently on the global research site

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:20.440
 and some of the other more peripheral ones which seem to be speaking more truth

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.440
 than mainstream media has cumulatively done over the century.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.440
 - Well, speaking of that, so obviously we'll talk about all those things,

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.440
 but first I wanted to chat about Ray's newsletter,

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.440
 and then we could kind of go off the deep end on all the coronavirus stuff.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.440
 And so, Ray, you just sent out your Ray Peat's newsletter,

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.440
 Estrogen, Iron, Degenerative Aging, and Progesterone.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.440
 And again, it's insane to me that you're--

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.440
 Go ahead.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:50.440
 I was going to say, I thought you were putting together new parts of the puzzle,

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:53.440
 and I thought it was just amazing that you're still synthesizing these new ideas

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.440
 every two months, you know, so I thought it was a fantastic newsletter.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.440
 What was your motivation behind writing it?

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:10.440
 - Just noticing that people weren't putting two and two together over the years.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:19.440
 Stuff that people could have been actually doing serious work on 50 years ago.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:27.440
 No one really has the motivation or energy to draw the conclusions.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.440
 - And I thought--

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:37.440
 - Incidentally, some people probably still don't have their copy of it

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:50.440
 because Gmail is limiting it to a certain number every 24 hours.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:54.440
 And so I think about half of them still haven't gone through.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.440
 - Bummer. If you need any help with that, let us know, obviously.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.440
 But what were some of the major points?

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.440
 You're obviously conversing with the public all the time.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.440
 What are the huge misconceptions that you feel like this newsletter covered

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:14.440
 that are just repeated over and over that you think are incorrect?

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:22.440
 - That working on one part of it, like taking an aromatase inhibitor,

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:27.440
 isn't going to solve very much.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:35.440
 At the same time, improving one thing is likely to be making something else worse.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:43.440
 And so to look at the whole process as far as you can

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:55.440
 and think of how you can remedy things with the least risk of doing more damage.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.440
 - I have a question on one of the main themes that you have there,

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:04.440
 which says that osteoporosis and dementia are associated with iron overload,

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:08.440
 but they're also associated with an increased likelihood of anemia.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.440
 So what would be your understanding of anemia?

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.440
 Just low ferritin and low iron saturation?

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:22.440
 - No anemia, low blood, low hematopoietin, low hemoglobin.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:31.440
 And about 50 years ago, someone was studying the health of California migrant workers

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:40.440
 and found that the kids running around somewhat hungry and dirty

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:50.440
 were healthier than the local middle class Anglo kids.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:46:02.440
 And one of their features, the immigrant, very poor kids,

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:08.440
 had I think a hemoglobin of 10 or 10.5, something like that.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:20.440
 And it isn't just malaria in Africa that flares up and kills people

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:23.440
 when they give them an iron supplement,

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:32.440
 but right in the U.S. they can see that so-called anemic kids are healthier

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:40.440
 than the ones with the so-called normal levels of hematocrit and hemoglobin.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:45.440
 - So by iron overload, you mean the accumulation of unusable iron

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:52.440
 in the forms of lipofuscin and other iron complexes?

00:46:52.440 --> 00:47:02.440
 - Yeah, and estrogen is one of the things that causes you to retain iron,

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:09.440
 but protectively lowers your hemoglobin and hematocrit.

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:17.440
 And for 100 years, doctors have looked at the women

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:25.440
 sometimes with very low hematocrit or hemoglobin and prescribed iron pills

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:31.440
 and kept prescribing it even if their hemoglobin got lower,

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:39.440
 not understanding that the same thing that makes them overload on iron

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:45.440
 is blocking their bone marrow formation of red blood cells.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:52.440
 - So the well-known effects of increasing hematocrit and hemoglobin

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:57.440
 under the effect of androgens, is that due to the opposition of androgens

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:01.440
 to estrogen or a direct effect of androgens?

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:08.440
 - Both direct on the bone marrow in particular,

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:16.440
 androgen stabilizes it and helps it get warmer,

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:21.440
 more productive, estrogen tends to lower the temperature,

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:33.440
 and that goes, among other things, with a tendency to inflammation and iron toxicity.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.440
 - Have you seen those studies that claim that the purpose, apparently,

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:40.440
 of fever is to deplete serum iron and tryptophan,

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:44.440
 which helps greatly in fighting off an infection?

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:51.440
 - Yeah, and it reduces all sorts of cytokines,

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:59.440
 chilling creates inflammation, secreting inflammatory cytokines,

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:06.440
 and causes cells to take up water,

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:13.440
 and the falling temperature is not only a sign of,

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:24.440
 but it's one of the mechanisms by which estrogen changes the body physiology.

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:30.440
 - Can you run through the calcium metabolism and how that leads to the accumulation of iron?

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:36.440
 What does parathyroid hormone have to do with iron overload?

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:43.440
 - The way parathyroid works, for example,

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:55.440
 under stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:59.440
 that system activates the parathyroid hormone.

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:11.440
 Serotonin, pro-inflammatory, activates the parathyroid to provide more calcium

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:17.440
 to the bloodstream by taking it out of the bone.

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:26.440
 And the way it takes it out of the bone is to suppress the formation of carbon dioxide

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:36.440
 because carbon dioxide helps the present calcium to crystallize into the bone

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:41.440
 as calcium carbonate.

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:46.440
 And when the CO2 production is lowered,

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:55.440
 it's replaced by glycolytic production of lactic acid,

00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:05.440
 and the lactic acid in itself helps to dissolve the bone.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:13.440
 pH isn't the thing because you can have low pH with CO2 forming bone

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:19.440
 and the same pH with lactic acid disassembling the bone.

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:27.440
 And in all the rest of your tissues, including the cells in your bone,

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.440
 making the lactic acid,

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:38.440
 all of the intracellular processes, blood vessels in particular, suffer.

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:45.440
 When they shift from producing carbon dioxide to producing lactate,

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:49.440
 the intracellular pH rises,

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:56.440
 increasing the negative ionization of the cell proteins,

00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:06.440
 increasing their affinity for metals with a positive charge.

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:16.440
 Ionized calcium with two positive charges, iron, aluminum, lead,

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:25.440
 any other metal that is present will be stuck inside your soft tissue cells

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.440
 along with the calcium,

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:34.440
 especially if the calcium is deficient in your diet.

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:39.440
 You will be taking up more iron, aluminum, lead,

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:44.440
 whatever is present in your intestine.

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:52.440
 So the more calcium deficient you are, the more parathyroid hormone you make,

00:52:52.440 --> 00:53:01.440
 and the more other metals will be present under the influence of parathyroid hormone

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:10.440
 to crystallize, poisoning your blood vessels and brain cells and kidney cells in particular.

00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:15.440
 In Gilbert Ling's theory, potassium, which is another alkali mineral,

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.440
 has the highest affinity for the intracellular proteins.

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:22.440
 How are these other metals, such as sodium, calcium, and iron,

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:29.440
 able to displace potassium and disrupt the structure that potassium forms in the proteins?

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:46.440
 The carbon dioxide causes its affinity for electrons as an acidic Lewis acid molecule,

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:53.440
 and as it associates with the proteins, the electrons are retracted,

00:53:53.440 --> 00:54:03.440
 making the electron cloud holding the potassium proton,

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:09.440
 holding the potassium alternatively with protons,

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:20.440
 making it experience a lower attractive concentration of electrons.

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:29.440
 And since the water polarization of the big potassium atom

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:36.440
 doesn't interfere with that lower electronic attractive field,

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:44.440
 the potassium is strongly attracted even to an electron retracted protein.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:56.440
 But as the carbon dioxide is decreased and the pH rises under the influence of forming lactic acid,

00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:06.440
 then the electron cloud on the protein is no longer retracted towards the CO2,

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:13.440
 but it forms a more intense concentration of negative charge,

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:26.440
 which will overcome the highly polarized water layers around sodium, for example,

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:34.440
 but also around other highly concentrated positive charges.

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:43.440
 So once the sodium starts displacing the potassium,

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:57.440
 then the calcium and lead, mercury and iron will have a chance to get in at the same time as the calcium.

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:05.440
 So you're saying that during the elevation of lactic acid production, intracellular pH rises,

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.440
 but that's because the cell quickly expels the lactic acid it produces, right?

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:13.440
 That's what's raising the pH, because if the lactic acid stays inside,

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:17.440
 the pH will drop and the cell will probably die.

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:24.440
 Yeah, but the lactic acid quickly moves out of the cell and acidifies the environment,

00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:32.440
 creating other problems, activating inflammatory signals and so on.

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:41.440
 But what happens inside when the lactic acid leaves is an increased pH

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:48.440
 because of the way the NADH handles its protons.

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:54.440
 Does lactic acid increase the reactivity of iron?

00:56:54.440 --> 00:57:01.440
 I don't recall how they interact directly.

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:07.440
 Okay, so iron basically, by being in the body, if there are a lot of reactive oxygen species,

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:12.440
 they're the ones that turn iron into the reactive form, which is the ferrous iron,

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:15.440
 and that's what attacks the polyunsaturated fats?

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:26.440
 Mm-hmm. The CO2 is known to have an inactivating effect on iron,

00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:37.440
 helping to keep it in a relatively oxidized state because of that acid property of CO2.

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:51.440
 And just by displacing CO2, then lactic acid is, in effect, likely to make iron more reactive.

00:57:51.440 --> 00:58:03.440
 When you reduce the triply ionized ferric iron, you get the highly reactive ferrous iron.

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:15.440
 So the reducing property of lactic acid is for sure going to create iron damage.

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:18.440
 And in that case, the reactive oxygen species are also a problem

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:22.440
 because they also have this reductive effect, right?

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:28.440
 I mean, so keeping the metabolic rate high and preventing the leakage of these reactive oxygen species

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:34.440
 through the membrane, keeping their numbers low, is another thing that will limit the activation of iron

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:36.440
 and turning it into the reactive form.

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:45.440
 Yeah, it's a whole flowing system that changes the nature of the cytoplasmic substance.

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:55.440
 It's a process that isn't just an adding of a lot of little events,

00:58:55.440 --> 00:59:07.440
 but the whole—the way Gilbert Ling saw it was that the nature of the substance of the cell

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:12.440
 has these different ways of existing.

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:16.440
 What is the direct conductor of this whole process?

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:19.440
 I mean, in some articles you mentioned thyroid and other CO2,

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:25.440
 but I guess the main effector of these beneficial changes, which keep the intracellular pH low,

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:30.440
 keep the iron from getting into the reactive state, keep the electron flow going,

00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:33.440
 it seems that all of this, the direct agent is carbon dioxide,

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:38.440
 but the thyroid is just the cause of the creation of carbon dioxide.

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:50.440
 Yeah, this CO2 is the most pervasive and powerful and immediate causer.

00:59:50.440 --> 01:00:02.440
 And it simultaneously goes with your consciousness, your level of motivation and sensitivity

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:12.440
 and all of those things, all of the life properties correspond to basically the level of CO2 in your tissue.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:20.440
 In your estimation, is parathyroid hormone one of the strongest stimulators of lactic acid production?

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:24.440
 Yeah, as I presently understand it.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:29.440
 So all things being equal, if you were to be injected with estrogen or serotonin or PTH,

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:32.440
 PTH would be the worst out of all of those?

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:39.440
 Yeah, except that estrogen ends up increasing your PTH.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.440
 Well, I was talking to Kate Deering, we were trading emails back and forth,

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:48.440
 and we were trying to figure something out, and I realized I had like a

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.440
 estrogen increases parathyroid hormone, prolactin increases parathyroid hormone,

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.440
 aldosterone, like every single thing, serotonin increases parathyroid,

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.440
 so it seemed like that was, I don't know, the final common path of stress.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.440
 Is that how you look at it?

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:17.440
 Yeah, the angiotensin system is very close to it, but I think that's the right way of seeing it.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.440
 But the reverse is also true, isn't it?

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:26.440
 Parathyroid hormone stimulates the production of all of these other mitigators as well.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:33.440
 Yeah, because it creates the degenerative alarm condition,

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:47.440
 and the short-term recuperative stress hormones all exacerbate the long-range degenerative processes.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:52.440
 And last question about this, I'm pretty, I don't know if I caught this ever,

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:59.440
 the parathyroid hormone is stimulating the production of lactic acid from the bone specifically, is that right?

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:11.440
 Well, that's its functional, most known action, but it can't help doing it everywhere in the body.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:17.440
 And then to do that to other tissues, it just has to be in the blood, is that right?

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.440
 Yeah.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.440
 Awesome.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:25.440
 What increases cellular uptake of parathyroid hormone, and what, conversely, what inhibits it?

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.440
 Is there a mechanism that can do one or the other?

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.440
 One or the other, what?

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.440
 Cellular uptake of parathyroid hormone.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:38.440
 In other words, is there a way to make the cell more resistant to parathyroid hormone?

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:45.440
 Like, I mean, I know the medicine talks about receptors, but as you said, the cell is the entire receptor,

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.440
 the entire cell is the receptor.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.440
 What makes the cell resistant to parathyroid hormone?

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.440
 Nothing that I know of.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.440
 Wow.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.440
 So really the only way to protect is limit its synthesis.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:06.440
 Yeah, and vitamin D and calcium and magnesium are the things that are best known to do that.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:16.440
 But at the same time, reducing androtensin and serotonin and aldosterone, for example.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:26.440
 Is there a specific parathyroid hormone receptor that medicine claims is the main mechanism through which that hormone works?

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.440
 I'm not familiar with it.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:40.440
 Okay. Maybe that's why, like, there may be steroids that compete with it, but I guess the receptor hasn't been found yet,

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:46.440
 or at least medicine is not interested in looking at it because they think parathyroid hormone is the greatest thing since sliced bread.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.440
 It's given to osteoporotic people to increase their bone growth.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.440
 Yeah.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:55.440
 Ray, I forgot what article you had posted this in,

01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:00.440
 but apparently parathyroid hormone is harder to suppress as you get older or sicker,

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:09.440
 and it was a DAMI paper, A-D-A-M-I, relationship between serum parathyroid hormone, vitamin D sufficiency, age, and calcium intake.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:16.440
 I think it does increase with age.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:32.440
 One of the interesting things that they don't like to talk about either is that the bone with aging and osteoporosis forms lots of aromatase.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:41.440
 It becomes a powerful source of estrogen at the same time that it's degenerating.

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:46.440
 And that would be ameliorated by what? Just decreasing the activity of the parathyroid?

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:50.440
 Or no, this is a functional aspect of the bone that's not going to change?

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:54.440
 Or how do you reverse that?

01:04:54.440 --> 01:05:03.440
 Yeah. Getting your calcium and vitamin D and magnesium high enough that you turn off your parathyroid hormone,

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:14.440
 that's necessarily going to reduce the local stress and all of the signals that increase aromatase.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:18.440
 Amazing. Might take a five-minute break here. We have Ray Peat on the phone.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.440
 Georgie Dinkov, my partner in crime.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:25.440
 We're talking about Ray Peat's newsletter right now. The newsletter is available by email now.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.440
 It's $28 US, which can be paid through PayPal.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:35.440
 Ray Peat's newsletter, Peats@gmail.com. Ray is sending those out right now.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.440
 You can also email Ray Peat's newsletter to purchase Ray's books.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:43.440
 I frequently come in contact with people that have no idea that you've written any books.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:48.440
 I would strongly recommend people get a hold of these. They're basically collector's items.

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:59.440
 Ray, why don't we talk about Progest-E from Ketogen and how does progesterone relate to parathyroid hormone?

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:06.440
 It strengthens your bones and turns off aromatase.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:18.440
 Once you recognize that stressed bones produce estrogen by their local aromatase,

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:26.440
 then you see one of the reasons that progesterone is going to strengthen the bones because it knocks out,

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:35.440
 it inhibits aromatase and knocks out the estrogen receptors.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:43.440
 In addition to good nutrition and calcium and vitamin D, progesterone, thyroid, vitamin K would be good things for osteoporosis?

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:49.440
 Yeah, everything good helps your bones.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:55.440
 I have a question. In one of your newsletters, you said that serotonin antagonists are highly anabolic for the bone.

01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:01.440
 I've seen a number of different studies come out with the various drugs, one of them ondansetron,

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:06.440
 which is prescribed for nausea but it's really a serotonin antagonist.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:15.440
 It seems that these agents somehow directly work on the osteoclasts and osteoblasts without necessarily affecting parathyroid hormones.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:22.440
 It seems like serotonin has a direct effect on bone health that is, while overlapping with parathyroid hormone,

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:26.440
 there's an independent component of it too. Would you agree?

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:31.440
 Yeah, I think everything really is overlapping.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:41.440
 The receptor idea is just a way of trying to introduce order kind of artificially.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:46.440
 Amazing. Thanks for that. Email Catherine to purchase Progest-E.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.440
 Each bottle contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone. It lasts a very long time, unless you use it topically,

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.440
 which I'm going through bottles every month.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:08:00.440
 Another question on progesterone. In one of your articles, you mentioned that high enough concentrations of progesterone

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:05.440
 can actually make the so-called estrogen receptor protein completely disintegrate.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:12.440
 I've seen many studies confirming that and other substances, such as caffeine, apparently have the same effect.

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:21.440
 Does progesterone have the same sort of disintegrating effect on aromatase too, or is it simply inhibiting its effects?

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:29.440
 I think it's just blocking the promotion.

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:38.440
 For example, one of the powerful promoters of aromatase is prostaglandin, E.

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:56.440
 The enzyme cyclooxygenase that makes prostaglandin is activated under almost exactly the same circumstances that activate aromatase.

01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:09.440
 So there's almost always prostaglandin, E, present, pushing for the formation of estrogen.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:29.440
 Progesterone is known to, in multiple overlapping ways, to block the formation of prostaglandin, E, by creating destructive metabolites of it,

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:51.440
 blocking its formation and probably several parallel mechanisms that prevent the activation, opposing cortisol's activating effect on aromatase.

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:57.440
 What do you think is the main mechanism behind the synthesis of the actual aromatase protein?

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:07.440
 Is it simply under the body detects the metabolic rate is low or there are tissue and organ needs, you know, massive amounts of repair,

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.440
 and that's what triggers genomically the synthesis of more aromatase?

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:16.440
 Or is there another mechanism behind it, like radiation, heavy metals, things like that?

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:32.440
 Yeah, all of those things overlap for more than 50 years. Radiation, hypoxia, vitamin E deficiency, progesterone deficiency,

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:49.440
 all of these have been known to activate the formation of more aromatase.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:11:01.440
 You have to then look at what each one of these things is doing. Each one of those factors, radiation, hypoxia, and so on,

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:20.440
 is also activating many other parts of the cell, which lead to activation of aromatase. So it's like a holistic switch mechanism

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:34.440
 in which everything gathers up a summation of forces to either turn aromatase on or off.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:45.440
 Does the entry of steroids into the cell depend on the steroid structure and the status, the lipophilic or hydrophilic status of the cell?

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:51.440
 For example, cortisol and estrogen are much more hydrophilic than things like pregnenolone or progesterone.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:57.440
 So if the cell is composed of fully saturated fats and is highly lipophilic,

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:06.440
 would that decrease the amount of hydrophilic steroids such as glucocorticoids and estrogen and aldosterone from entering inside the cell?

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:18.440
 Yeah, because at the same time it's keeping the energy state of the cell up, which maintains the hydrophobic condition.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:46.440
 The stabilizing of the hydrophobicity is also the stabilizing of the energy level, and that suppresses all of the things that would call for raising the amount of estrogen or cortisol in the blood.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:13:00.440
 So a very well energized, highly lipophilic cell would be resistant to estrogen even though it may be expressing the estrogen receptor at a normal level.

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:06.440
 So it may look like an estrogen sensitive cell, but estrogen can't really do much because it cannot get inside.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:18.440
 Yeah, and it's probably keeping the estrogen receptors on the verge of disintegration to keep the hydrophobicity high.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:27.440
 Do you think that may account for some studies that show that if you drastically increase the intake of saturated fat in the diet,

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:34.440
 it shows an increase of the amount of estradiol in the urine and sometimes in the blood as well?

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:41.440
 Would that be simply because the body is excreting all of this estradiol that cannot be used because the cells simply are impervious to it?

01:13:41.440 --> 01:14:05.440
 I think so. A group, I think, generally led by Pasqualini has identified the processes of increasing estrogen in the cell or decreasing it.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:19.440
 And in about 10 different ways, progesterone's effect is to get estrogen out of the cell and inactivated,

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:26.440
 made water soluble so that it travels through the blood quickly and is excreted.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:39.440
 So the deficiency of progesterone will leave your cells highly activated by estrogen.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:52.440
 For example, in the uterus or breast tissue that is deficient in progesterone, it's internally, it begins making its own estrogen

01:14:52.440 --> 01:15:03.440
 but doesn't depend on the ovaries or adrenals to, you know, they used to cut those out to prevent or cure breast cancer.

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:11.440
 But if you take out the ovaries and adrenals, you're also taking out progesterone

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:29.440
 and that activates the process of forming estrogen locally, starting with the uterus and breast, but eventually going to every tissue that has been studied.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:38.440
 Since the main method of deactivating estrogen is the glucuronidation process and glucuronic acid production depends on glucose availability,

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.440
 would you say that...

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:42.440
 Sulfation.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.440
 Sulfation, yes.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:49.440
 Would you say that the presence of sufficient amount of glucose in the diet, of carbohydrates in the diet,

01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:53.440
 is vital for the proper excretion and deactivation of estrogen?

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:58.440
 Yeah, I think so.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:17.440
 The glucuronic acid is related to the vitamin C producing system and that requires the normal flow of carbohydrate through the system.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:25.440
 Great stuff. Before we move on, Ray, was there any other part of your newsletter that we should touch on before we move on?

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:28.440
 Nothing occurs to me.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.440
 Okay, great.

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:33.440
 I have a question about lipofuscin.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:39.440
 What is the mechanism through which lipofuscin inhibits the electron transport chain?

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.440
 Does it bind to one of the complexes directly, such as cytochrome C oxidase,

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:51.440
 or does it simply impede the flow of electrons by its accumulation and, I guess, electric repellent forces?

01:16:51.440 --> 01:17:08.440
 My basic idea is that it's consuming the oxygen and the electrons that should be available to the mitochondria

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:18.440
 and it's directly turning them into hydrogen peroxide and superoxide and water.

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:21.440
 But in order for that process to happen,

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:26.440
 basically the accumulation of reactive oxygen species needs to occur,

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:31.440
 which suggests that a block of oxidative phosphorylation is already happening, right?

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:34.440
 Yeah, but it's like an amplifier.

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:43.440
 Once the process starts, you're making more heme oxygenase, releasing more iron,

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:49.440
 getting a more reduced environment that makes the iron more toxic,

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:58.440
 and consuming oxygen, lowering oxygen tension, accelerating the process.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:12.440
 Once a person in old age reaches a point where they're visibly developing massive accumulation of dark pigment,

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:21.440
 it is extremely quick that they will go on to die.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:25.440
 I was going to move on, Georgie. Stop me though if you have another question.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.440
 No, I don't.

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:29.440
 Ray, we were talking before this and I joked,

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.440
 and I said, "How are things in the apocalypse in Oregon?"

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:35.440
 And you said things are halfway through.

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:40.440
 Instead of just going through the news and talking about all the bad things that are happening,

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.440
 of course we can't do that, but can you summarize what's going on?

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:51.440
 Is this the capitalist class winning and then winning over the working class?

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.440
 How can people think about what's going on in a reasonable way?

01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:01.440
 Because it's extremely confusing what's happening, I feel like.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:10.440
 The ruling class knows very well how to herd people, scare them with something,

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:17.440
 get a lemming conformist trend going,

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:25.440
 and keep them scared and inform them that everyone is going to do it

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:30.440
 and you'll be a freak if you don't go along with them.

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:38.440
 And so I think they're even inflating the number of people who are really getting the vaccines.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:52.440
 The propaganda has reached a point, I think, that it is triggering the irritation,

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:58.440
 self-defense reflex in more and more people who are –

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:04.440
 as they start communicating, finding ways around the censorship,

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:10.440
 that frightens the ruling class more and so they panic and get more absurd

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:17.440
 in the lies they're putting out through the media.

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:24.440
 Well, people with two vaccines becoming suddenly un-vaxxed because they don't have a third one,

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:28.440
 I mean, should shake anybody to their core that this is insane.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:34.440
 And of course, I mean, that's – if I were to hypothesize, given the things I've seen,

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:42.440
 that's just to normalize constant vaccination and that's part of the agenda for whatever reason.

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:53.440
 Yes, three vaccines in a year and that's not counting the influenza and shingles

01:20:53.440 --> 01:21:00.440
 and chickenpox and all of the other vaccines.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:15.440
 They haven't revised anything so it says now adults are going to need multiple, many annual vaccinations.

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:24.440
 Even though the information has been coming out for several years that the influenza vaccine,

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:31.440
 for example, makes you much more likely, several times more likely than the unvaccinated

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:38.440
 to develop a respiratory pneumonia-like problem.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:49.440
 So there was a huge campaign the previous year, 2018 into 2019,

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:55.440
 to get Italians vaccinated with the influenza.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:04.440
 And according to everything that's known, that would multiply several-fold their risk

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:10.440
 of developing some other respiratory disease.

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:17.440
 So that very likely was a factor in the high mortality in Italy,

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:24.440
 that they had been so obedient in getting their influenza vaccine.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.440
 I don't know if you checked out that Notion document I sent you, but there were two tweets.

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:33.440
 One was from Marx in 1842 and another one from Illich in 1976.

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:39.440
 And it seems like people were sounding the alarm on the possibility of a medical dictatorship.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.440
 And so I'm sure given the amount of things you've read,

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:50.440
 probably a lot of people have talked about this, that it would come to some kind of technocratic medical nightmare situation.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:55.440
 There's a movie called V for Vendetta, which was fairly recent, which was exactly about that.

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.440
 I haven't seen it for years.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:05.440
 Ray, did – I mean, you've read a lot of Illich's stuff. Was that something he was chronically talking about?

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:27.440
 Oh, yeah. He saw education and medicine as the two basic evils of our society that were destroying humanity.

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:32.440
 What about technology? The Unabomber thought technology is at the core, is the actual direct agent.

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:35.440
 Do you agree with that, of the destruction?

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:52.440
 Well, yeah, the way technology is used in indoctrination, the existence of the technical knowledge itself needn't be harmful,

01:23:52.440 --> 01:24:06.440
 but they create this ideology of the digital view of consciousness, for example, that's separate from technical understanding.

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:27.440
 If Norbert Wiener had been followed, there wouldn't have been this digitized reality quantization of everything as part of the philosophical reductionism.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:30.440
 That reality is discrete instead of continuous.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.440
 Yeah.

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:41.440
 Ray, by the second vaccine, third vaccine, and impending fourth vaccine, would there be something a person could measure on a lab test?

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:48.440
 Would their aldosterone be through the roof or something with inducing that spike protein? Would there be something they could identify?

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:58.440
 Inducing the spike protein? I'm not sure what you mean.

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:09.440
 Like if somebody was skeptical that these vaccines were harmful, could they get a blood test for something that would demonstrate that their physiology was completely out of whack?

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:15.440
 Oh, yeah. I think the antidepressant would be pretty high.

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:19.440
 That's an accurate blood test?

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:22.440
 Yeah.

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:25.440
 Interesting. I've never had a measure.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:35.440
 I don't know if you've seen the news, but China is embarking on a massive vaccination campaign to vaccinate 1.1 billion people by October 1st.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:42.440
 What do you think is behind that? Is China also under control of the powers that be?

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:57.440
 Or do they have another motive, afraid maybe that if this virus narrative falls apart, maybe CIA or who knows who else will release another virus and that one won't be as benign?

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:11.440
 Yeah, I think China keeps in mind the history of germ warfare of the United States, and that's probably part of their thinking.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:19.440
 But they also collaborated with the United States in that Wuhan Institute of Virology on this gain-of-function research.

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:28.440
 So is that a case of keep your friends close, your enemies closer? Does China just want to get an idea of what the Americans are thinking of unleashing?

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:33.440
 Or do you think China is on board with this whole globalization plan?

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:51.440
 I think it's a faction in China. I think the president, he intervened and sort of cut down the Fauci faction.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:58.440
 Oh, I see. So that may be behind his announcement that he's going to redistribute the wealth, make China more equitable?

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:02.440
 I guess, yeah.

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:05.440
 I was going to move on to questions. Georgie, stop me if you have any other.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:10.440
 So before this, Ray, I gathered a bunch of questions from people that watch this show.

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:14.440
 And so I thought we would run through them and then let you go.

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:17.440
 Guys, give this episode a like. Sincerely appreciate it.

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:21.440
 We have an amazing listenership that hangs out every Friday.

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:24.440
 So, guys, thank you so much, Georgie. Thank you, Ray. Thank you.

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:34.440
 So my number my first question here was hopefully like a clarification of Georgie and I were talking about collecting the urine and each liter being about a thousand calories.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:37.440
 But I think I might have Georgie might have said it correctly and I might have goofed it.

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:47.440
 But can you just explain that that test, that at home test for collecting urine and how to quantify how many calories you're burning real fast?

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:52.440
 No, I don't know how it would be used for counting calories.

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:58.440
 Well, didn't you mention that if you discard the morning urine, then you collect the urine the rest of the day?

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:04.440
 Couldn't you do some kind of math and then figure out how many calories you're burning?

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:16.440
 If you measure your water, total water intake and urine, then you know how much water you're evaporating.

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:24.440
 And that goes up as you burn calories. So you have to know the water balance.

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:31.440
 So you basically perspire about a liter of water for every thousand calories burned, right?

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.440
 Yeah. Yeah.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:35.440
 My apologies to Georgie, because I butchered that and I said you were wrong.

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:39.440
 So my apologies, Georgie. Thanks for clarifying that.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:46.440
 Speaking of something else you can clarify, I have a quote from you in 2012 and it says, I have known, this is the relevant part,

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:52.440
 when it's taken to small doses, 50 micrograms of T3 will usually normalize any hypothyroid metabolism.

01:28:52.440 --> 01:29:07.440
 And I actually send that quote to a lot of people and I just wanted to like bring it back up since it's nine years old and see if you still felt similarly about that kind of upper cap of 50 micrograms of T3.

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:16.440
 That's just the equivalent of the old standard two grains of armor.

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:25.440
 It's partly just an arbitrary number because it varies so much with individuals.

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:37.440
 But roughly 25 micrograms of T3 sums up about the same as as one grain of armor.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:47.440
 And since the average replacement dose used to be two grains of armor, that's where that 50 micrograms came from.

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:57.440
 And if somebody was taking 50 micrograms, like the people that you know who have done that, do they take 10 micrograms five times per day with food or do you split up even smaller?

01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:06.440
 Yeah, either way, but for sure split up so it comes in gradually.

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:08.440
 Good. Stop me at any time, Georgie.

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:16.440
 Another question from a listener here, and they said, I'd like to hear from him about some of the reasons that he is so upbeat about Mexico.

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:20.440
 The ones that you mentioned he talked about on the call that you were on with him.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.440
 In fact, I'd like a whole show about Mexico, he says.

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:30.440
 So I mentioned on a live stream saying that we were on a call that I didn't set up by some other people and you were very positive about Mexico.

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:36.440
 And so I think that's on a lot of people's minds right now of, hey, I got to get out of the US or I got to get out of somewhere else.

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:40.440
 And I mentioned that you had a very positive view of Mexico.

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:43.440
 If you want to reiterate any of that, I think people would enjoy it.

01:30:43.440 --> 01:31:00.440
 The objective evidence is that I guess it was about 20 years ago, Cuauhtémoc Cardenas really won the popular vote, but lost the election by fraud.

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:15.440
 And the fact that in actual votes, as well as electoral success, AMLO had national support.

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:27.440
 The fact that the great bulk of the population supports those two individuals shows a lot about the quality of the country.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:35.440
 Very, very different from European-American consciousness.

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:44.440
 Do you think there's any truth to the claims that there was election fraud in the last election, in the presidential election in the US?

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:50.440
 I mean, if this can happen in Mexico, why couldn't it happen here, considering the sophistication of the three-letter agencies?

01:31:50.440 --> 01:32:00.440
 Yeah, the use of digital voting machines operated through computers.

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:08.440
 It's the perfect way to hide the fraud to some extent.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:20.440
 Black Box voting, when it was pointing out fraud by the Republicans, was a very popular website.

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:32.440
 But I think they're still in operation, but no one wants to investigate fraud by the Democrats comparatively.

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:42.440
 Do you think the court system has been completely compromised, or at least compromised to the point where even if evidence is unearthed, it will simply go nowhere?

01:32:42.440 --> 01:33:05.440
 Yeah, I think the courts are well-packed with state supporting, no matter which party. It doesn't really matter that much which fascist party you're keeping in power.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:16.440
 Ray, before I read off more questions, is there anything you want to say about Afghanistan, and is there anything you want to say about the so-called FDA approval of the vaccines?

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:39.440
 Oh, I think there was a possible positive interpretation for Biden wanting to do what Trump wanted to do, get the army out of some of the wars.

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:54.440
 And I think today's bombing probably was the factions that can't afford to have any decrease in war expenditure.

01:33:54.440 --> 01:34:14.440
 The trillions that have gone through the military industry in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan, they don't want to see the tap turned off to their endless money supply.

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:36.440
 Do you think Biden's decision to withdraw, was there anything good behind it, according to you? Or do you think it was more along the lines of a political move because midterm elections are coming, he wants to please the war-weary public, money can be spent on other things, the public really doesn't want any more wars right now?

01:34:36.440 --> 01:35:01.440
 Yeah, I think their interpretation of natural positive action by Biden is reasonable. But the faction that doesn't want to stop the war will kill lots of people to try to get the reoccupation going.

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:12.440
 Great stuff, thanks for that. Okay, here's another one. Ray has previously mentioned that his favorite animals are ants. Are there any animals that Ray considers to be evil or malevolent, such as mosquitoes or hyenas?

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:34.440
 I don't think so. It's just what they interpret as food that isn't compatible with our well-being. I noticed someone who asked the question, I think, had the name sandwich.

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:56.440
 It's a matter of perspective. Mosquito and hyena see lunch when they smell a person. It's just in conflict with human preferences.

01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:12.440
 You have a good memory for remembering that. On that note, do you think that hunting for food is not an immoral activity for a human?

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:41.440
 Yeah, if there's actually a reason to hunt for food, if they really need food. It's like a hyena. You can't say that they're having evil thoughts just because they have a different idea of what lunch is.

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:56.440
 That's exactly the context I was asking about. If a person is hungry, and if food supply becomes a problem, or becomes too compromised, and all you have is a gun in the wilderness, then it's a matter of perspective.

01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:04.440
 Yes, it's a living creature you're destroying, but you're not doing it for fun. You're doing it because you saw food.

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:11.440
 Semi-related, but do you have any favorite examples of mutual aid in the animal kingdom?

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:20.440
 Oh, there are so many of them.

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:32.440
 People are impervious to that idea that nature isn't anything but terrible and harsh and cruel. That's why I feel like just getting your thoughts on it is useful.

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:48.440
 You can see a lot of videos on the internet of animals expressing grief and gratitude and mutual support and so on.

01:37:48.440 --> 01:38:01.440
 I watched one, and it must have been a tiger or something, and a bird had fallen into a tar pit, and the tiger went over to it, grabbed onto its wing, and swung it out of the tar pit. It was pretty good.

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:14.440
 I have several other examples. There are several videos on YouTube where you can see how a herd of buffaloes saves an antelope that a lion has basically latched on.

01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:35.440
 The buffaloes will go in and kick the lion. Usually the lion leaves when he sees a herd of buffaloes, but if he doesn't, then he'll get kicked out.

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:49.440
 This is a very common example of how people are playing with it, not really treating it as food, and just letting it be.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:39:05.440
 I've seen videos of people releasing a grizzly bear from a trap, a very large Canadian gray wolf from a trap, a bobcat, and I think even a mountain lion.

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:12.440
 Typically, if you get that close to these animals under normal circumstances, you will probably get attacked.

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:21.440
 It's amazing that these animals were basically just sitting there quietly, allowing the human to free them up, and in some cases, after that, they refused to leave.

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:26.440
 They just kept following the human around as if they somehow became friends.

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:33.440
 Yeah, actually, animals show gratitude and friendship.

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:43.440
 Have you seen this in birds? In one of your books, you mentioned that birds are apparently really good at trying to get people's attention and form cooperative relationships.

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:50.440
 Yeah, and you probably remember the story I told about the ant.

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:57.440
 I put out an ant that was drowning in honey, and its head was exposed.

01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:16.440
 An ant came along and found a drop of honey, but it ran around to see how big it was, and it saw the head sticking out and jumped back in shock, and then discussed the situation for a while.

01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:25.440
 Very agitated communications, and then it went around to the side and sat down and started eating.

01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:40.440
 Another ant came along, did exactly the same thing, jumped back in shock, except this time the communication was very short, and it went around and started eating honey.

01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:54.440
 I didn't stay there to see if more ants came along and did the same, but when I came back an hour later, the drop of honey and the ants were all gone.

01:40:54.440 --> 01:41:03.440
 Oh, wow. Do you think ants communicate strictly to chemical messengers, or do you think they can do electromagnetic things, too?

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:10.440
 They were obviously doing some kind of sign and touch language.

01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:29.440
 The first one, they would discuss it a while, and the arrived ant would run around, and they would talk about it some more, and it ran around two or three times, describing how big the drop was before it started eating.

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:36.440
 So these stories about a horse whisperer or a wolf whisperer or whatnot, they actually have basis in reality.

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:40.440
 Apparently, people can learn the language of animals and communicate with them.

01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:55.440
 Yeah, I'm convinced that ants, for example, have lived around people enough that they've learned English or whatever language they're around.

01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:19.440
 A couple of times when ants were bothering a roommate who was going to get some ant poison, I just firmly and clearly said, "If you don't leave, that person is going to poison you," and they just disappeared.

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:29.440
 You're saying we could experience a Coco the Ant-like situation with sign language. One day we could figure out the ants' language with their arms and things like that?

01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:46.440
 I think so. It's obviously a very efficient language that can take a new, totally novel situation like that and size up the nature of the problem.

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:55.440
 So the second ant arriving got the idea in just a brief conversation.

01:42:55.440 --> 01:43:02.440
 I interrupted you. Did the ants that were bothering your friend, did they just quickly go away, or what happened?

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.440
 Yep, it just disappeared.

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:19.440
 Great stuff. You know, I have one more question. You called mushrooms an inspiration based on their structure and what they're able to do. What are so special about ants? Why are they so amazing to you?

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:44.440
 At a relatively low body temperature, they can be so quick-witted. As they get very cold, then they slow down. But they think and calculate just with amazing efficiency. Basically as smart as anyone.

01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:53.440
 Do you think them living in those burrows, basically just like the naked mole rat, they're exposed to high concentrations of carbon dioxide?

01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:55.440
 I think so, yeah.

01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:06.440
 Have you seen the studies showing that ants don't age? Basically they die either from a predator or a trauma, basically. Something squashes them. But they don't really age.

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:13.440
 That would be the outcome of living in a high CO2 environment, I think.

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:37.440
 Okay, we'll jump to another question after talking about ants for 20 minutes. Macaroni Delta says, what advice can Dr. Peat give regarding the best way to treat romantic grief, i.e. a broken heart? What a physiological or philosophical approach to it be most effective? I think he had more there, but I cut it off.

01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:41.440
 Find a substitute or replacement.

01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:45.440
 That's excellent.

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:52.440
 That's funny because that's what the dating community would say, is quickly find somebody new. Why do you say that?

01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:55.440
 It works.

01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:03.440
 So do you think the concept of a soulmate is basically just a fairy tale? In other words, there could be many soulmates?

01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:05.440
 Yeah.

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:07.440
 That's really funny.

01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:28.440
 Okay, here's a philosopher. You may have heard the expression. I'm blanking on the name. It was a European philosopher. He said that love is the illusion that one woman is more special than another. I guess this can be extended to both sexes. In other words, you can fall in love many, many times and you'll be just as good if it's with the right person.

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.440
 Yeah.

01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:42.440
 Great stuff. Okay, here's another one. Can you ask Dr. Peat to expand on his views of ontology? He has talked about Meinong previously. Thanks.

01:45:42.440 --> 01:46:01.440
 Yeah, the ontologists have usually been confused, getting mental processes confused with thinking about the nature of reality itself.

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:18.440
 And the idea of continuity and of interaction constantly. Everything is impressing its aspects on everything else.

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:45.440
 And so the nature of being is constantly changing as the world evolves. The substance itself is changing in the ontological sense, the same way a cell changes with experience.

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:52.440
 And that's related to William James' radical empiricism, right? Same thing?

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.440
 Right.

01:46:54.440 --> 01:47:02.440
 Speaking of him, did you know that he had a concept about stress called reservoirs of power? Did you ever read about that?

01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:04.440
 Nope.

01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:10.440
 I was reading a book and it was talking about Hans Selye and then it mentioned Canon and it talked about early concepts of stress.

01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:16.440
 And then it mentioned William James and I was like, what the heck? I thought he was a philosophical person.

01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:20.440
 And then I found a few mentions of something called reservoirs of power.

01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:30.440
 And he was basically talking about what I interpreted to be an extreme stress state bringing on another level of accomplishment.

01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:35.440
 But it was just interesting because he's clearly talking about, okay, here's the actual quote.

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:50.440
 William James suggested that every person, there are reservoirs of power which are not ordinarily called upon, but which are nevertheless ready to bring forth streams of energy only if the occasion presents itself.

01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:57.440
 I don't know, you're familiar with those earlier concepts of stress. Were there any that were interesting to you?

01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:02.440
 No, not especially.

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:07.440
 Okay, we'll jump to another question here. Thank you guys so much for hanging out with us for Friday.

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:14.440
 Ray, I won't keep you too long. I'll let you go very soon. Thank you so much for hanging out. Thank you, Georgie, for making this possible.

01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:17.440
 I have a question about this reservoirs of power.

01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:25.440
 There are well-documented cases where mothers are basically capable of lifting cars just to save a child that's been pinned underneath.

01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:34.440
 And under normal circumstances, they're not known to come anywhere near close to that level of being able to muster up so much power.

01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:49.440
 So, I mean, do you have an idea what may be behind this mechanism? What could be causing the southern and clearly unnatural or at least not normally present amount of muscle contraction force that these women can muster up?

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:52.440
 Is it some kind of a steroid reaction?

01:48:52.440 --> 01:49:15.440
 A very good coordination of the chemistry and the nervous innervation, I think, strengthens the fascia and muscles in a physical way that makes the parts stronger to meet the needs of the moment.

01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:26.440
 So what would the – I mean, clearly, since these women are not being able to muster up those powers on demand, it's only under extreme circumstances.

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:38.440
 Is there any way this can be trained in a person, in other words, to be – to sort of like improve the condition, the physiology to get closer to that clearly higher potential that we have?

01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:53.440
 Yeah, I think it involves things like getting up your pregnenolone basic level and DHEA that strengthens the substance at all levels.

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:56.440
 Great stuff. Ray, I'll only ask you two more questions and then let you go.

01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:03.440
 So this one's from Christian, wondering if you could recommend a safe and prothyroid way of oil painting.

01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:06.440
 Maybe what substances and habits to avoid when painting.

01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:13.440
 Also, maybe if he could talk about his own personal painting practice.

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:23.440
 I try not to use my fingers too much, but I'm always tempted to smear the paint with my fingers.

01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:35.440
 That's not a good idea generally. And to have a very good ventilation is the other essential thing.

01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:44.440
 Great stuff. And then we'll kind of end it here. Could Ray describe what a typical day of eating looks like for him?

01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:59.440
 Very random in a sense, because I got tired of doing it one way and so innovate constantly.

01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:16.440
 The common themes are milk, orange juice, eggs, cheeses, occasional cheese tacos, various soups and so on.

01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:20.440
 And orange juice seems to be one of those difficult things to find.

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:25.440
 Are you using orange juice concentrate right now or do you have a good source of oranges?

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:29.440
 No, bottled pasteurized orange juice.

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:34.440
 Oh, interesting. Do you have a brand? Because I know a lot of people, I get that question all the time.

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:38.440
 And I haven't been in the US for a long time and I'm not sure what's good or not.

01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:44.440
 No, it was just trial and error. I don't remember the brand.

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:50.440
 Awesome. We'll do one more advertisement here. The newsletter, Ray Peat's newsletter that we were talking about earlier is $28.

01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:57.440
 You can send that to RayPeatsNewsletter@gmail.com. You can order Ray's books by sending that email,

01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:00.440
 a name of the book and they'll send a digital copy to you.

01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:11.440
 And then you can order Progest-E from Keenogen, email Catherine, who's very nice and send it out very quickly in a package that provides protection for while the progesterone is traveling.

01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:20.440
 And that is it. Any final words here, Ray, that the world is going crazy and things are hard to deal with right now.

01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:26.440
 Is there any piece of advice you could give to anybody to maintain?

01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:40.440
 Keep learning about the virus. It's currently the most important thing about the reasons for the great dangers of the vaccines.

01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:43.440
 And then, Georgie, you as well.

01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:46.440
 Last question, really, do you think that the powers that be are winning?

01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:57.440
 I mean, I can see it going both ways because this whole technocratic nightmare that they're trying to impose depends on turning the entire population depending on the state.

01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:10.440
 But the United States is not really – the empire is not really in a financial position right now to sort of endlessly pay people to do nothing and become dependent simply because it's in such a massive amounts of debt.

01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:22.440
 And if you look at this fiat currency thing and the printing, they cannot go on forever because it will essentially destroy the dollars, the reserve currency, and then the dream of the neural order people is going to go down the drain too.
