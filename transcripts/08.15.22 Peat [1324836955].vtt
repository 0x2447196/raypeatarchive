00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 Hello.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.040
 Is this the lovely and talented Dr. Ray Peat?

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.880
 I think so.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.960
 How are you doing there, kid?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.960
 Pretty well.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.960
 Oh, you sound good.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.960
 I'm good.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.960
 I was probably vegetables causing a problem.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.480
 Yeah, so that's...

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.320
 Let's talk about on the air, that's very interesting.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.560
 How could I possibly be a vegetable?

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.840
 But you were having a problem, weren't you?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.320
 I mean, we could hear it.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.320
 Oh, sure.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:49.640
 It was not quite as annoying as Robert Kennedy's, but I think it was basically the same.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 But it seems like it's...

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.080
 It sounds like it can even get better.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.880
 You're still not quite through it?

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.880
 Yeah, it's...

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.960
 Well, let's talk about it on the air.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.960
 Let's talk about it on the air.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.880
 Because people were emailing me and they were really concerned about you, you know?

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.200
 Because we didn't know.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.480
 I should have asked you what was going on, but I didn't want to intrude into your life.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.880
 So, you know what I mean?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.560
 That's the only reason I didn't say anything.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.520
 Okay, so let's get going here.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 We'll have some fun.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.520
 We'll have some fun.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.440
 Okay, so we are streaming audio.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.720
 We are streaming, recording audio.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.720
 And now we're going to record video.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:44.720
 And then we're going to re-stream it, right?

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.240
 There you go.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.120
 Broadcasting from the beautiful Hill Country in Texas, this is Juan, RadioNetwork.com.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.800
 Well, very pleasant.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.800
 Good morning to you.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800
 Welcome back.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.800
 We are live.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 Well, we were live five minutes ago, so I guess we're still live.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.800
 Wait a minute.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.800
 That's not right.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.800
 Hold on a second.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.800
 Why isn't that working?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.800
 Hold on a second.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.800
 Let me get the video thing right and I'll figure it out.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.400
 Oh, I know what I have to do.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.800
 Let me change something real quick.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.800
 Sorry, I thought I had it, but then I didn't.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.280
 If you'd like to join the show, well, you have to do it by email because Ray Peat is

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.280
 on the telephone.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.280
 And he's a PhD.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.280
 He's been a PhD for a very long time.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.600
 One of the best ever in the world.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.800
 Does great research and has been working on things for you and helping people since the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800
 '60s.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.800
 He taught in a naturopathic school and his work with hormones is just kind of like legendary.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.800
 He probably knows more about the thyroid than anybody on the planet or the earth plane today.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.320
 Sorry, no planet.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.400
 So if you'd like to be on the show, the email is the way to do it.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.800
 It is patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.240
 Mr. Peat, good morning.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.240
 Good morning.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.240
 Good morning.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.240
 Good morning.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:23.000
 So a couple of months ago, you started having a little bit of trouble talking, right?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.600
 Oh, a lot of trouble.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.600
 A lot of trouble.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:37.080
 Well, several months before that, I had tried some ham and bacon that were preserved with

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.280
 celery juice powder.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.280
 And I knew I was allergic to celery, but it was so good.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.320
 I went ahead and ate it.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:55.080
 For about two weeks, I could hardly breathe the tightest my vocal cords ever got.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:07.480
 And then after several months, I decided to experiment with changing my diet.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:18.840
 Thirty-five years ago, I developed a migraine from eating many vegetable-related foods and

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.840
 spices and things.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.240
 And so I was checking that out to see if I still had any of those terrible allergies.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:36.000
 And I didn't, but they had changed to the phlegm and tightness of the vocal cords.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.880
 And so I was experimenting with a higher, higher vegetable diet.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.760
 And it didn't work well.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.360
 Yeah, a chronic tendency to cough and resisting the cough.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:03.720
 I would get just a constant spasm of the vocal cords, which I think is the same thing basically

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.280
 as what they call spastic dystonia.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.760
 That's what Bobby, Robert Kennedy Jr. has, right?

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:20.640
 Yeah, it makes the cords so tight that you just squeak.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.160
 There are variations on it.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.800
 I've known a couple of people who went silent.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:35.640
 They had the choice of either complete tightness and not breathing, or they just paralyzed

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.440
 their vocal cords and couldn't make a sound other than a whisper.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.920
 And so this all started through just eating certain vegetables that you were allergic

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.840
 to a couple of months ago.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:58.360
 And I think it works through causing a general inflammation, intestinal and respiratory in

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:10.160
 general, but it probably related to aging or something that some people, it's just

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160
 in the vocal cords.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.160
 Interesting.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.120
 Well, this started a couple of months ago.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.360
 The last two shows you were really having a hard time getting through the questions.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.320
 And I didn't say anything, because out of so much respect for you, I didn't want to

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.880
 butt in and say, "Are you having a hard time?"

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.800
 I just didn't know what to do.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.040
 But we just went through the shows and they were fine.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.600
 And now it sounds like you've still got a little bit going on, but you're working through

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.800
 it just by changing your diet.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.800
 Yeah.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.800
 Wow.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:50.640
 Yeah, I'm probably still very allergic, but I avoid the worst things.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.200
 You avoid the worst things.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.840
 So what are you eating now?

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.240
 I cut out basically all of the vegetables.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:08.280
 I'm still trying oatmeal, though I like my oatmeal breakfast.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.280
 Yeah.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.280
 Very easy.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.560
 That's the only vegetable cereal I'm still having.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.560
 Really?

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.560
 Yeah.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.520
 I've been totally off vegetables for about three months because I'm doing this whole

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.600
 carnivore thing, you know.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.880
 And I've never felt better.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.680
 I don't miss vegetables either.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:35.000
 Yeah, I didn't miss them for about 40 years.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.680
 But you never really, did you ever really get stuck getting into the whole heavy meat,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.280
 heavy animal protein thing?

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.160
 Did you ever do that?

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:51.320
 Not philosophically, but in practice that was when I had money to buy tasty food.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.880
 That's what you ate, huh?

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.880
 Yeah.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.920
 It's so funny because I just read an email and I wanted to read it to you because I think

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.240
 this is important that we talk about this because you know how much respect I have for

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:11.040
 you and everybody in your work and there was a fellow that sent in a comment on a show

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:17.760
 that we did with a fellow doctor, his name is Ivor Cummins and he's called the Fat

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:26.040
 Emperor and he wrote a book called, let's see, something like Eat Rich and Live Long,

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.760
 thousands of studies and he's really well researched about the benefits of more fat

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.000
 in on the diet and animal foods.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.840
 So this person emailed in, Doc, and he said, "Have you bothered listening to a single

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.280
 word while questioning Dr. Peat throughout the past decade?

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.760
 Well, ironically, you have another chance to learn nothing this coming Monday."

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.680
 So, I mean, let's talk about that.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:59.360
 I mean, even if you had 12 PhDs and the most respected thing in the world, if you were

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.480
 recommending eating a particular way that didn't work for me, would you still recommend

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.480
 I do that?

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.600
 Oh, no, no, that's the first thing.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:16.640
 Watch and adjust and adapt.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:24.840
 Starting 50, 60 years ago, I realized that more people were getting sick from their supplements

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:33.840
 that were being helped and I just suggested that they try cutting out the supplements

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.400
 for a week or 10 days and it was just amazing.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:47.160
 There was a cure of hay fever throughout the hay fever season in Eugene when people just

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.720
 stopped their vitamin C and other things.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.320
 Isn't that funny?

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:59.600
 So this would be all kinds of things, even vitamin C or vitamins and minerals, isolated

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.160
 minerals, isolated nutrients?

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:14.280
 They can all be extremely hard on the digestive system and cause more irritation than benefit.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:20.360
 I have to tell you, Dr. Peat, three months of just eating meat and butter and eggs and

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.760
 goat's milk, my gut has never felt better or worked better in my life.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.720
 It's just crazy.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.720
 What's that about?

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.600
 I mean, come on, what's that about?

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:38.840
 You can see it works with just about any kind of animal.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:47.840
 Rabbits are among the few animals that don't tolerate a lot of animal fat, but their digestive

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:54.240
 systems are just too adjusted to plant material.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:05.200
 But everyone is benefited in some way if they can totally leave out plant material because

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:15.840
 the muscle and fat contain almost none of the intrinsic allergens.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:26.960
 Plants have to defend themselves with putting poison in their tissues, but animals can fight

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:33.520
 back or run to escape, so they don't need to have poison.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.520
 They can run away.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.480
 Yeah, the carnivore people talk about these things.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.160
 I think some of them are oxalates, some are other things.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.440
 The curious thing about eating a lot of carbs and vegetables, Dr. Peat, and potatoes and

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:53.720
 stuff is that you end up pooping two or three times a day, but it turns out that you're

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.160
 just pooping out all the fiber, and if you don't eat that, you don't have to poop

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.160
 three times a day.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.160
 Do you know what I mean?

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:07.760
 Yeah, they've shown that babies have no trouble making adequate bulk on pure milk

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.440
 diet.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.560
 You don't need fiber to make bulk.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:26.240
 The bacteria normally grow to produce about 80% of the bulk of the movement.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.880
 So do you think we need fiber at all?

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.880
 Even grains?

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:42.080
 Oh, yeah, lots of people show benefit from adding fiber, even though the fiber itself

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.640
 is intrinsically irritating.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:52.640
 There have been studies in which it worked like an antibiotic, basically.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:59.960
 It moved things through the intestine so much faster that the bad bacteria didn't have

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.440
 a chance to grow.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:08.800
 It moved things through faster so that wonky bacteria couldn't grow.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.800
 Wow.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.800
 Yeah.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:22.440
 Women at a fertility clinic, I think it was, were being given antibiotics to see if they

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.320
 maybe had an ovary infection.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:35.160
 And when they took the antibiotic, it didn't improve their fertility, but it cured their

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.120
 chronic PMS and headache symptoms.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:45.520
 And so they were studying what was happening there.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:57.600
 And the antibiotic worked the same way a laxative does to keep the bacteria from producing toxic

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.400
 irritants.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:12.240
 And in a group of experiments, we gave women just raw carrot every day rather than an antibiotic.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.600
 And the same thing happened hormonally.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:21.640
 Their PMS-related hormones normalized.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:32.200
 Cortisol-indicating stress went down to normal just from cleaning up their intestine, getting

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.760
 faster movement.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:45.560
 And the reason for that is that low thyroid makes the intestine move slowly, and that

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:52.920
 lets the bacteria overgrow, produce toxins.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:15:03.240
 And so anything you can do to get the intestine to move faster is going to improve your hormone

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:10.840
 function by not letting the bacteria create the stress leading to the PMS.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.840
 Interesting.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.080
 So that's what this degraded carrot that you like does, right?

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.080
 Yeah.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:24.880
 I eat a carrot every day for about 20 or 30 years.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.880
 So do you wear glasses or does it really affect the, I'm just kidding, on the vision?

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.640
 Is it vitamin A or something?

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640
 Vision?

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.440
 No, that was just for the fiber effect.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.840
 Oh, just for the fiber.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.480
 But is there something to carrots in the vision like it's been talked about or is that just

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.480
 a fairy tale?

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:53.880
 Yeah, the too much carotene from carrot juice, it's the main problem because it interferes

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.720
 with your thyroid function and progesterone.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:07.400
 So if you start getting orange skin on your palms, that means you're maybe exposed to

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.200
 too much carrot juice.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:14.040
 We used to do that back in the 80s when we were drinking lots of carrot juice in the

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.960
 hippie food stores and we would all have these orange palms because we thought carrot juice

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.840
 was the best thing ever.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.840
 It was crazy.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:27.080
 Yeah, boy, if you have orange palms, you know you're having too many carrots, right?

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.120
 Yeah, or maybe just too slow thyroid function.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.800
 Oh, see, that could be it.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.240
 So you couldn't burn through it.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.760
 I wonder how long this whole thyroid thing has been going on.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.920
 I mean, with people like you and others over the last 20 years, it's come out.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:50.480
 But do you suspect that the whole thyroid epidemic, low and all the rest, has been going

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.480
 on for a long time?

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:17:06.880
 Rona Barnes did his PhD work and medical doctor work both in the 1930s and his surveys found

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:14.680
 that throughout the world, probably about half of the population has always been more

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.680
 or less hypothyroid.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.040
 Really?

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.040
 Do we know why?

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:27.680
 Oh, yeah, the mineral deficiency of iodine is probably the worst thing.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:37.280
 But lots of areas where they eat, I forget what grains are worse, barley I think was

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.320
 one and lots.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:51.320
 The cabbage area of Eastern Europe had a terrible incidence of glater and heart disease related

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:56.720
 to hypothyroidism.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:02.840
 But I thought you don't recommend iodine supplementation, so I'm confused.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:08.880
 Nope, never iodine, but very often thyroid.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.440
 But very often thyroid, pink thyroid or whatever.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:22.040
 Yeah, people who take, there have been several dozen studies around the world since iodized

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:32.040
 salt and they found that eating even half a milligram of iodine extra per day because

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:37.760
 of the salt leads to an increase in thyroid cancer.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:44.720
 So, that's why we don't want to do the lady with the umbrella and iodized salt, right?

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.040
 You don't want to do that one.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.040
 What kind of salt do you use?

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.440
 Morton's, canning and pickling.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.920
 Oh, the canning and pickling, yeah.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.080
 That's what Dr. Hal Huggins used to use when we had him on.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.160
 Remember Dr. Huggins and the mercury guy?

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.760
 That was his favorite, the pickling and canning salt.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:13.640
 What about those salts like the Redmond from, I think it's Utah and a lot of folks think

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.080
 that that's really good stuff because of the minerals.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:22.560
 You don't think that, you'd rather do the pickling?

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.560
 Pickling with what?

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:28.000
 You'd rather do the pickling than canning salt rather than even some of the ones with

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 minerals, correct?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 Oh, sure, definitely.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.720
 It's the cleanliness of it that is important.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:47.720
 Very low pollution in general where some of the mined salts are on the borderline of toxic

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.840
 with iron, for example.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:20:02.360
 If the salt is pink, it has too much iron and if it's gray, it might just be mud from

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.560
 poor refining of seawater.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.680
 Yeah, wow, wow.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.880
 So go with that pickling and canning.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.560
 It's one of the most inexpensive salts on the planet.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.560
 Really?

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.560
 I mean, it's a box of what?

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.560
 About a buck and a half for a big box of it, right?

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.440
 Yeah, it must be close to two pounds.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.880
 Yeah, Morton's Pickling and Canning Salt, go figure.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.480
 Dr. Ray Peters with us, Patrick Timpone, on Radionetwork.com.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.360
 I'll tell you about his website.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:35.000
 Well, I'm really feeling much better because, and I should have said something, but I didn't

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.920
 want to assume that you had something going on with your brain because you know what I'm

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.080
 seeing when you couldn't speak very well over the last couple months?

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:49.000
 And so I'm just so pleased that you figured out what it is, which was the vegetable thing

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.600
 in your throat and not anything with your brain.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.600
 Your brain's fine, right?

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.600
 Apparently.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.600
 Because I thought we were going to lose you there for a minute, sir.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.160
 I said, "Why isn't that good?"

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.160
 Apparently fine brain.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.160
 Let us do a quick break and then we're going to take some emails, okay, Doc?

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.640
 Stay right there.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.720
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone, on Radionetwork.com.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:16.400
 See, I should have said something, but I didn't want to say anything because, you know, it's

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.280
 like, here's this guy, he knows everything about this stuff, a lot of stuff, and what

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.280
 do I know?

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.280
 I can't say anything.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.040
 Oh, well, we just live and learn, hopefully.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.720
 This is a product that's on sale right now, Restore 20.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.320
 It's a promo code, 20%.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.240
 The first supplement I like to take in the morning right after I wake up is Pine Pollen

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.480
 Pure Potency, or P4.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:43.040
 This is Cirque Rival's flagship testosterone and androgen support formula.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.160
 It's made with the pollen of pine trees, which is rich in testosterone, androstenedione,

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.240
 DHEA, and a bunch of plant sterols.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:55.760
 These are all substances, phytochemicals, that support the body's natural androgens,

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.920
 or male hormones.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:02.760
 Of course, men and women are using this product, but usually it's men in andropause, men after

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.680
 age 40 whose testosterone production has started to decline.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.080
 Many of Cirque Rival's supplements can be taken any time of day, but Pine Pollen Pure

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:14.520
 Potency, it's important that you take at very specific times of the day.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:19.320
 Now, it can be taken once, twice, or three times, depending on how much you want to supplement

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:25.200
 yourself with the phytoandrogens found in it, but the key is taking it at morning, right

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.880
 upon waking, midday or noon, and then again right before bed.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.040
 So once, twice, or three times a day, but always at those times, and that's because

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.560
 that's when your body's naturally producing its own testosterone.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.320
 And all we want to do is amplify that sign wave.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.640
 We don't want to start to take testosterone at a time where our body's purged it from

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.640
 the bloodstream.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.000
 Instead, we want to take it at a time where those levels are already spiking, and we're

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.440
 just subtly helping to increase them.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.000
 This product tastes fantastic.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.840
 I think of it like an orange creamsicle, and that's because in addition to that subtle

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:03.400
 pine flavor, there's a little bit of orange peel, Tahitian vanilla bean, cloves, and then

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.280
 a little bit of maple syrup, just to give it this nice kind of sweet orange flavor.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.640
 So it's really delicious and easy to take.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.340
 So if you're looking to increase your testosterone or androgen levels, and you want an alternative

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.880
 to pharmaceutical testosterone replacement therapies, there's nothing that does it better

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.520
 than Pine Pollen Pure Potency.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.000
 And this is a promo code, OneRadio.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000

 It's a great product.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.840
 We think you'll really like it.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:51.720
 It's a food, so you won't be doing anything weird with your body.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.480
 It's just a food from trees, things like that.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.560
 Have you tried our sulfur?

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.800
 You might say, "Wow," if you try our sulfur.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:05.160
 My friend was down in Los Angeles recently, and he brought up some pure sulfur.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.560
 We just ordered some from you.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.560
 Yeah, that's awesome.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:12.880
 Yeah, I was just looking at it, and I was like, "Wow, this stuff really is totally different."

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:18.160
 I put a tablespoon in my mouth and just chugged it with water.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.160
 Wow.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.160
 Yeah, thanks.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.160
 A lot of people get that "wow" thing.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.440
 I felt something the first time I took it about three years ago, and we've been promoting

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:31.560
 this pure organic sulfur ever since.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:36.160
 Two pound orders, three different prices, United States, Canada, worldwide.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.160
 I'm embarrassed in how old that commercial is, three years.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.000
 I do what I can.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.680
 It's a great product, and you can join the crowd, and people order it over and over and

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.000
 over again because they really like it.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.360
 That's why they do that.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.360
 It's on our website.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.640
 If you want more than four pounds, email me, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:07.480
 The EMF protection device that you see on your screen and also on audio, you can go

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:13.120
 to our One Radio Network website and look at the EMF protection device that's called

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.480
 Blue Shield.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.120
 This thing really works.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.000
 I've got one up here in the studio.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.960
 I have one downstairs that goes out 90 yards.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.800
 It's a little cube.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.640
 It deals with the cells in the body.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:34.760
 It just helps the cells to somehow magically deal with electromagnetic fields in a better

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.760
 way.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.760
 It doesn't block it.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.000
 It's not trying to block anything.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.880
 They figured it out because they know how these things affect the cells in the body.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.080
 This Australian company figured it out about 20 years ago.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.440
 They've worked with them with animals, chickens and cows.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:56.400
 They reduce mortality, increase the milk supply, egg supply.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:01.840
 The placebo effect is there because not a lot of cows listen to the show.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:02.840
 It works.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.960
 They've proven it with peer-reviewed studies.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.160
 They're not peer-reviewed, but they've done studies.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.440
 I just threw that word in there because I get used to saying it.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.440
 Check it out.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.600
 The EMF protection device.

 That didn't work.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.200
 I think this will work.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.200
 This will work.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.200
 Broadcasting from the beautiful Hill Country in New York City.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:35.960
 Broadcasting from the beautiful Hill Country in Texas.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.280
 This is One Radio Network.com.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:43.640
 We're talking with Dr. Ray Peat and he's a PhD.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.840
 It's RayPeat.com and you can get his newsletter and we'll tell you about that.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.900
 I think it's RayPeat's Newsletter.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:51.900
 Right, doc?

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.900
 Plural at gmail.com.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.900
 Ray Peat's Newsletter.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:54.900
 Possessive without the plastic.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:55.900
 Possessive.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:56.900
 Ray Peat's Newsletter.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.340
 It's Possessive Without the Apostrophe.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.140
 Without the apostrophe, yeah.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:07.540
 So you were in Mexico for a while and they do plenty of beans and stuff down there.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:12.100
 In general, do you think beans are okay for some of us to eat or most of us or what do

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.100
 you think?

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.260
 Oh, the way they're traditionally fixed.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:23.140
 The black beans which take about two days or more to cook.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:33.460
 They're fine people to digest them easily and they're nutritious but if you eat them

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:40.540
 out of a quick food restaurant or out of a can, they're likely to be more toxic than

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.380
 beneficial.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:47.380
 So what if we just buy black beans organic at the store?

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.420
 Can we fix those up so they're relatively good for us?

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:56.620
 Yeah, you have to soak them and prepare them for almost two days.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:57.620
 Really?

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.620
 Two days?

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:03.660
 Quickly tell us how to do that in case somebody, people like beans and want to do it.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:04.660
 How do you do it?

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:11.740
 I've never done it myself but I've seen it in process and then tasted the results and

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:22.820
 they serve them on a plate, just one bean deep surrounded by their juice.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.300
 They're very delicate.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.300
 Really digestible, huh?

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.300
 Really digestible.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.300
 Yeah.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.300
 Wow.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:34.500
 So you're soaking and sprouting and I'm sure people can find it on YouTube on how to traditionally

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.500
 prepare beans.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.900
 I'm sure they're up there somewhere.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.980
 There must be some videos.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:46.380
 Yeah, the soaking, the black beans take much longer to soak than normal beans.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:51.740
 And then you talked to us about the nixtamalization of corn which is a whole process that they

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:57.780
 go through oftentimes in Central America that can literally make corn a really good food

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.580
 and otherwise it's not so good.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.860
 Yeah, and some of it's made in the factory.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:14.980
 You're speeding it up too much and if you squash one of the pieces of hominy open after

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:23.540
 they supposedly have cooked it, you can find opaque white starch inside and so that means

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:31.980
 that your end product, like your tortillas, are just never quite going to taste right

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.540
 or have the proper nutrition.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:42.340
 It depends on the size of the kernel so you can't do it by rote.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:50.820
 You have to check each piece of cooked corn to make sure it's translucent all the way

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:51.820
 through.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:30:00.820
 I guess we lost all the traditional practices over the years of preparing food.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:09.100
 Yeah, the Chinese, for example, and other Asian cultures knew about the process probably

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:15.100
 as long as 20 or 30,000 years ago.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:22.180
 A lot of the carnivore people we've been talking about, I think I sent you a few videos

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:29.140
 and the fat people are arguing, they say you can prove that really the brain wants to do

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.140
 fat and not sugar.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.140
 Do you agree with that?

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:38.780
 Oh, no, it depends on the person.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.820
 Some people are sugar heads, some people are fat heads?

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:55.060
 The good thing about fat is that in a famine, a little bit goes a long way and so it's designed

00:30:55.060 --> 00:31:02.900
 into us that it should taste good because it's a survival food.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:12.980
 But when you have fruit every day, for example, you can store just as much fat as you need,

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:20.500
 but your energy level stays a lot higher so you burn your energy every day.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:27.940
 The fat person tends to burn less than all their fat.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:33.380
 What happens if you add fruit to your meat and your fat?

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:38.580
 That completes the diet, makes it more nutritious.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:51.860
 But ideally it can help you prevent obesity because it satisfies your appetite in a way

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:59.140
 that doesn't necessarily happen with just fat and meat.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:10.900
 Too much meat keeps your metabolism in turmoil and keeps it turned on so you tend to eat

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.900
 too much.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:16.300
 I found the opposite, Doc, that I'm just never hungry doing this diet.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.300
 I'm just not hungry.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:22.140
 And then I only eat when I get hungry, which is only a couple times a day.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:33.540
 Yeah, that's the famous weight loss diet where you eat all the fat and meat that you want.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.540
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.540
 I haven't lost any weight, we'll see.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:42.060
 Here is, oh, yeah, here's, oh, somebody sent this, Adam Bergstrom, who's on our show, he

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:49.820
 said the medical name for death by celery is celery-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis,

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:55.340
 A-N-A-P-H-Y-L-A-X-I-S.

00:32:55.340 --> 00:33:00.540
 Every year, celery kills hundreds of sensitive people who don't sit down immediately after

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.540
 eating it.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.540
 Wow, isn't that interesting?

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:07.540
 Does that make sense to you?

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:16.380
 Yeah, sugar is recognized as an antidote, either adrenaline or sugar.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:24.860
 They both lower the shock symptoms and get your metabolism running again if you're having

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.780
 an anaphylaxis reaction.

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:29.780
 What is anaphylaxis?

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:34.620
 Is that what you had with the celery?

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:42.380
 Pretty similar, but mine was just very intense allergies.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:51.020
 My blood pressure was affected at the extreme, but the worst thing with anaphylaxis is your

00:33:51.020 --> 00:34:01.060
 blood sugar goes up and down, you go into shock and stop producing energy, and so getting

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:09.740
 your energy turned on again is what handles the allergic anaphylaxis.

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:15.260
 I listened to Colin before this show, I was wondering about aspirin, if I'd ask you again.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:20.340
 I told him that I thought you were okay with aspirin, but I will ask you again because

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.260
 he wanted me to.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:27.580
 Some people say it causes leaky gut or harms the stomach, and you?

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:37.620
 I was reading some life extension articles yesterday, and I found one which aspirin had

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:46.580
 the most extreme effects on life extension of any of the substances that they tested.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.580
 Do you think that's true?

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:54.740
 Yeah, this article seemed to be done by very competent people.

00:34:54.740 --> 00:35:02.900
 Have you seen any evidence that aspirin really does do the whole bleeding thing, or can puncture

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:07.100
 and leaky gut and the rest of it?

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:18.180
 Some of that is definite misinterpretation to sell Tylenol, and Tylenol does affect many

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:28.140
 systems harmfully, but to increase their sales, they said bad things about aspirin, including

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:35.260
 that it is a very dangerous cause of bleeding.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:40.980
 When you look at old people who have been very sick for a long time and finally go to

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:48.780
 the hospital, chances are they've been taking aspirin for whatever bothered them for years

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:53.780
 and years before they went to the hospital.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:36:05.180
 When you're under stress enough to send you to the hospital, just that prolonged stress

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:14.980
 takes 12 hours of very intense stress to cause very serious bowel bleeding.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:23.380
 Any sick, stressed person who goes to the hospital is going to be inclined to have a

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:31.340
 bleeding problem, and are just by chance more likely to be taking aspirin than people who

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.340
 didn't feel sick.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:37.820
 But Dr. Peat, isn't that the case with most anything?

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:43.700
 If we don't take into consideration the state of consciousness and the other worry

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:49.020
 or relaxed feelings and all of these things going on with all of us, how it affects what

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.260
 we eat and take?

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.020
 I mean, it's got to, right?

00:36:53.020 --> 00:37:01.220
 Yeah, everything has multiple meanings that you have to check out.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:09.340
 No wonder we're all bonkers with trying to figure out our teeth.

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:17.620
 Since we are different, can we be different in such a way that some people could do really

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:22.300
 well like on a vegan diet and another person would just almost die?

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.820
 Is that possible?

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:36.540
 Yeah, when you look at a very ideally done fat diet and a well-done carbohydrate diet,

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:42.980
 you can make each of them very safe and life-extending.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.180
 By just the amount and the combinations?

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.660
 Yeah, the combinations in particular.

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.820
 The combinations, wow.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:59.460
 So is there any benefit to having a low fasting blood sugar and a low A1c and just not having

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:08.260
 the blood sugar jumping up around when you're on a more animal-based diet and fat?

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:19.140
 Oh, that's a good basic condition to have moderate to low blood glucose just because

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:25.660
 you're not surging through stress episodes.

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:37.300
 The adrenals and pituitary are constantly signaling the pancreas to adjust your blood

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.940
 sugar and that affects your nervous system.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:42.940
 Everything, right.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.380
 So it's a beneficial thing to have more stable blood sugar.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.380
 Yeah.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.380
 Cool.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.980
 Okay, here's Luke in Germany.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.220
 We'll get to some questions.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.820
 Long-time listener, first-time emailer.

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:58.700
 Thank you for having me, Dr. Peat Ahn.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:06.460
 How much does total phosphorus intake matter if the diet has a good calcium-phosphorus

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.860
 ratio?

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:13.860
 Is a low phosphorus diet preferable to a normal phosphorus diet if the calcium-phosphorus

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:18.340
 ratio is exactly the same in both cases?

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:25.420
 I think within a very, very broad range, it's the ratio that matters.

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.140
 It's what, sir, that matters?

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.420
 The ratio that matters.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.420
 The ratio.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.420
 Mm-hmm.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.420
 The ratio.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:36.980
 And that would be, how do you, is that done through hair analysis?

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:41.540
 Oh, no, just looking at the food you eat.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.820
 I see.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.100
 And can you give us a general idea of what that ratio is?

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:52.580
 Oh, close to one to one, if possible.

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.580
 One to one.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:59.900
 It's okay to be three to one is still the safe ratio.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:03.060
 And the three being which one, calcium or?

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.620
 Phosphate.

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:16.500
 It's very safe to have high calcium and not too dangerous to have a slight elevation of

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.500
 the phosphate.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:27.620
 A chronic six or seven to one ratio, for example, is going to cause some serious problems.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:32.180
 And which mineral is the six when it's a problem, the phosphorus?

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:42.420
 Yeah, when you have five or six or seven times as much phosphate as calcium, even your risk

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:47.260
 for things like lung cancer are increased.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.860
 Wow.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.540
 And the high phosphorus foods are meats, right?

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.540
 Meats and grains.

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.540
 Meat and grains.

00:40:56.540 --> 00:41:02.700
 So if you're eating meat, maybe adding, make sure you can do some goat's milk or cow's

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.700
 milk, right?

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.700
 Get your calcium.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.700
 Right?

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:09.260
 Is that good?

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:14.300
 And that's your favorite way to get calcium, isn't it, if I understand talking to you?

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.300
 Milk?

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.420
 Is it what?

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:19.020
 Your favorite way to do?

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:30.580
 Oh yeah, because it's chemicals that control stress, make you use your calcium and magnesium

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:34.900
 most effectively.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:46.700
 And generally goes with things like not having a mental decline in old age.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:51.260
 So I found this one came in this morning, let's go to it here because this ties right

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.260
 in.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.580
 Dear Patrick, a question for Dr. Peat.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:42:02.300
 As our dairy cows are mostly pregnant, please ask Dr. Peat about the hormones in milk and

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.460
 how they might affect us.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:11.180
 It really depends on who's managing the dairies.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.700
 They don't always have to be pregnant.

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.300
 Oh, I see.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.540
 This sounds like this is just an individual.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:25.180
 So there's a way to not have them always be pregnant and that's better?

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:31.180
 Because then when they're pregnant, the hormones can affect us negatively?

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:35.980
 I think it's more stressful to the cow.

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:47.940
 We should be producing huge amounts of milk while trying to make a calf.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:52.540
 So is there any issues with just drinking raw goat's milk or raw cows or any kind of

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.820
 cow's milk with the hormones in general?

00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:00.700
 Yeah, they should be avoided.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:07.100
 Right but if we're getting like raw goat's milk or even organic cow's milk, should we

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:10.820
 even be thinking about if they got hormones we don't want or not?

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.420
 No, normally they're such very small amounts.

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.420
 I see.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.700
 It doesn't bother anyone.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:17.700
 I see.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:18.700
 Okay.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.860
 This is Anna, Dr. Peat, for you.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:29.500
 Is it possible to grow back joints that have been damaged by osteoarthritis?

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.660
 By hospital?

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:36.620
 By osteoarthritis, to have your joints kind of come back into form.

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:40.140
 The joints.

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:43.420
 They want to know if it's possible to rebuild the joints.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:53.820
 Well, I've seen joints that were effectively rebuilt literally overnight.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:44:00.260
 I think I told the story about my plumber before who said he was about to retire because

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:07.220
 the cartilage was so destroyed and his knee was stiff.

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:16.660
 Getting up a three-step porch was very, very painful to him.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:27.380
 But he rubbed a whole bottle of progesterone, ankle to thigh on that leg and just took a

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:32.380
 rest break from his plumbing work.

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:42.980
 Just after that, 40 minutes or so, his walking was more comfortable and fluid.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:53.780
 The next morning he said he had to show off his leg and he ran up and down the stairs

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:58.940
 one night and his wife had been a violist.

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:05.380
 He said that was the first time in years that either of them had slept through the whole

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.940
 night without needing aspirin.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:11.940
 Is that right?

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:18.940
 Despite that, he never got another bottle, never used it again.

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:32.380
 I saw him 10 years later still working full-time even though his knee was supposedly finished

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:39.060
 previously but he had totally forgotten that he ever had arthritis.

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:45.020
 So that would be an argument for a lot of people that believe, and give me some leeway

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:49.580
 here, but that believe that something's going on with their shoulder or knees or their joints

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:53.500
 are gone, that people say, "Oh, you're bone on bone," or whatever.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:56.500
 It could be a hormone issue that they don't know.

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:57.700
 Oh, sure.

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:02.660
 Low thyroid, high estrogen are the worst things.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:13.380
 I've known several women who were absolutely sure that if they took less menopause estrogen

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:23.500
 treatment that they would have even worse rheumatoid arthritis.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:29.620
 But since they were totally disabled, I finally convinced them to try it.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:34.460
 And in a week, their symptoms were gone.

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:42.980
 The red inflammation in the joint simply faded away.

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:45.540
 Just by cutting out the estrogen extra.

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:46.540
 Wow.

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:47.540
 Wow.

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:53.220
 So that's why you've been a fan of this product that you helped develop called Progest-Ease.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:57.780
 Take a little dab of that two or three times a week or whatever.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:01.660
 You think it's beneficial for us, for most of us.

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.660
 I do that.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:06.240
 I don't know what I'm doing but I like it.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.820
 So we have a fellow here, or a lady, Dr. Peat.

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:16.620
 Her name is Amy and she's got an 87-year-old mom who has recently been experiencing hearing

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:21.220
 loss in one ear and dizziness when standing.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:27.540
 The doctor said it was fluid in her ear and diagnosed her with Meniere's disease.

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:32.380
 The treatment is diuretics and low salt diet, which she already eats.

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:38.020
 Do you know what could cause Meniere's disease and would you recommend she does this treatment?

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:47.660
 It depends on the type of diuretic.

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:52.380
 You can achieve the same thing by adjusting the hormones.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:48:04.540
 Progesterone, for example, is a diuretic that can relieve Meniere's disease very quickly.

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:06.740
 So progesterone is a diuretic.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:13.540
 Wow, I wonder how she could tell if mom's getting the right kind of diuretic.

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:20.140
 How could she do that?

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:28.780
 It really requires when a person is that age, they should find someone who will really study

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:35.140
 it with them because it can make a big difference in their general function.

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:36.740
 Yeah, pretty tricky.

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:40.180
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.340
 We've got a good show for you tomorrow.

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:45.260
 We're going to be talking with a regenerative farmer.

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:49.060
 Who else are we going to do?

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.060
 I'll look at the schedule.

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:59.620
 In general, Dr. Peat, do you think it's worth the time, effort, and reasonable and beneficial

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:08.820
 to do these blood tests every now and then and look and see what's going on?

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:09.820
 It's interesting.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:10.820
 Interesting.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:14.620
 I like the way you say that.

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:25.860
 Yeah, I've never had it done myself because I can tell from my symptoms and functions

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:30.860
 that everything is within a workable range.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.500
 You can feel it.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:36.760
 You know if something's out of whack with your body.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.140
 That's pretty fun, isn't it?

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.140
 Good for you.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:40.140
 What was that?

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.480
 I said that's pretty fun.

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:42.480
 Good for you.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.980
 Just don't eat any more celery.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.460
 You'll be fine.

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:52.500
 How does Dr. Peat feel about avocado and avocado oil?

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:58.180
 Oh, I don't see any reason at all for avocado oil.

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:12.180
 But for ripe avocados, they're one of the pleasantest foods I can think of.

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.180
 Yeah, really good, right?

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.220
 I mean, the best fat ever, isn't it?

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:20.260
 If you're going to eat something other than vegetable and animal fat?

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:36.940
 Yeah, the amount of fat in the flesh is harmless if you only eat an occasional serving of the

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:37.940
 avocado.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:48.900
 But it's possible you could eat like a quart and a half a day and have an imbalance of

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.620
 your fats.

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:53.140
 What balance, sir?

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:59.140
 The fat balance could go out of a healthy range.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:02.420
 Oh, if you really overdid the avocado thing.

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:07.660
 Yeah, but a couple of avocados a day, I think you're safe.

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:09.580
 And eggs, you like eggs?

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:10.580
 You're a fan of eggs?

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:11.580
 Oh, sure.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:14.420
 Yeah, they're pretty good food, aren't they?

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:15.420
 Pretty good.

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:16.420
 Yeah.

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:30.620
 Yeah, as long as you have a backup so that you don't get either too much protein or not

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:39.820
 enough, the powerful effects they have on your insulin secretion can distribute your

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:41.260
 blood sugar.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:50.300
 So I try to avoid having a dinner of scrambled eggs at bedtime unless I have a lot of ice

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:53.380
 cream at the same time.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.740
 So wow, that's great.

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:58.220
 Scrambled eggs and ice cream, doesn't get much better than that.

00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:00.020
 So what does the ice cream do?

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.980
 It keeps your blood sugar up.

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:06.620
 So when you have eggs at night, what does it do?

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:08.100
 It dampens your blood sugar.

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:13.820
 It tends to hold it down all night.

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:18.300
 You know, that's so funny you mention that because I've tried eggs at night that some

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:23.920
 friends of mine recommend and I never did well with them too much and I do better with

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:27.220
 them like in the morning.

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:32.100
 So it's just you think lowering my blood sugar too much and it'll wake you up or something.

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:37.140
 Yeah, many people told me the same effect.

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:42.660
 What's going on in an egg that lowers your blood sugar?

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:46.660
 What's going on with eggs that lowers your blood sugar?

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:52.340
 Such high quality amino acids are powerful stimulants.

00:52:52.340 --> 00:53:03.900
 Your pancreas and the insulin lowers, gets the free amino acids turned either into energy

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:08.980
 or fat storage or building muscle.

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:17.700
 And so the amino acids quickly go away which can leave you short on glucose.

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:20.580
 Fascinating.

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:25.540
 We put a video on our front page and I'm trying to find the fellow's name and I really

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:26.540
 kind of liked him.

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:33.340
 He's got like two million visitors on his website.

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:37.980
 And not that that means he knows what he's talking about but a lot of people like him.

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:45.380
 And this video was all about the egg and he had all these graphs.

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:46.380
 His name is Eckberg.

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:47.380
 Do you know him?

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:48.380
 Yeah, I've seen his videos.

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:52.140
 Stan Eckberg, yeah.

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:56.140
 And he has all these graphs about the egg and all these different foods.

00:53:56.140 --> 00:54:00.660
 And he was saying there that these eggs have some kind of protein that in some senses are

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:03.140
 even more usable than meat.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:10.340
 Yeah, it's considered the highest quality protein of all.

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:17.900
 In fact, potato protein slightly exceeds egg protein for quality.

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:22.580
 I'm sorry, what protein does?

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.580
 Potato protein.

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:24.580
 Potato protein does.

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:25.780
 Yeah, we have people that say that.

00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:29.540
 Potato protein is actually even better than egg protein?

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:35.980
 Technically, in that sense of biological sufficiency.

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:40.260
 Wow, wow, wow.

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:47.380
 Do you think that if you hard cook them or what we call hard boiled or hard cooked or

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:54.340
 cook them too much that it is detrimental to the nutrients in the egg?

00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:56.140
 That's likely.

00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:59.740
 But not a lot.

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:09.140
 Too much oxidation makes it taste worse and worse, the more over oxidized it is.

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:16.020
 Yeah, I saw a video, Dr. Peter, of a fellow that said this is the way to do omelets, right?

00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:20.540
 So rather than mix them up like I was taught to do, you know, like chefs do, and then do

00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:25.460
 them in a pan, he said just put them in the pan, two or three, and slowly kind of turn

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:30.620
 them around so you're not really, you know, you're not really kind of, you're breaking

00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:31.620
 them up a lot.

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:34.020
 And boy, those scrambled eggs taste good.

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:35.020
 You know what I mean?

00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:36.020
 They're alive.

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:40.540
 Yeah, and they have functions that the other eggs don't.

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:48.180
 It isn't just the nutrients, but the slightly undercooked egg has antiviral and antibacterial

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:49.180
 actions.

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.180
 No kidding.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.180
 That's cool.

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.180
 But it tastes great too.

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:56.420
 I got a whole new way of making scrambled eggs that I've been doing my whole life.

00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:57.420
 It's kind of fun.

00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:00.980
 Here's a good one for you.

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:09.220
 Does Dr. Peat consider clarified butter or ghee in the same category as butter as far

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:12.780
 as part of his diet?

00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:14.420
 And then he has another question.

00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:16.460
 So do you think it's the same?

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:21.500
 I think it's the same nutritionally, but I never eat it myself.

00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:23.380
 Yeah, you just do the butter.

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.380
 Yeah, yeah.

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:27.620
 And it tastes better than ghee, right?

00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:29.580
 It's more fun.

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:37.540
 Does Dr. Peat prefer wheat bran or oat bran for his morning cereal?

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:46.620
 That's what I've been eating in recent months, just partly because of the taste of it.

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:57.180
 But there are differences between wheat and oats and other brands.

00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:06.380
 The cellulose of wheat bran is considered the safest of all brands.

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:15.180
 But just in case you happen to be allergic to wheat, oats is a good alternative.

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:20.780
 Do you remember cream of wheat we used to eat when we were kids?

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:23.780
 And we used to put butter and olive oil in my house, we were Italian.

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:26.180
 Do you think that, I mean, that didn't kill us.

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.180
 I mean, it had to be fairly good.

00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:30.180
 We had it quite often.

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:34.180
 Oh yeah, pulled ender.

00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:37.180
 The same with cornmeal.

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:39.180
 It was one of my favorite mushers.

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.180
 Yeah, they're fun.

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.180
 They're fun, aren't they?

00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:45.180
 Boy, especially in the winter in St. Louis, before you go to school and you have some

00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:47.180
 cream of wheat with butter, right?

00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.180
 Oh man, olive oil.

00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:53.180
 I guess the fat kind of carried us on to school or something.

00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:54.180
 I don't know.

00:57:54.180 --> 00:58:00.180
 Could you please ask Dr. Peat, blood glucose level that stays the same all day upon waking

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:08.180
 up before the meal, 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes after the meal and bedtime, unless it drops

00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:11.180
 into hypoglycemia, what can that be about?

00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:15.180
 So this person, let's see, let's go through this.

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:22.180
 Their blood sugar kind of stays the same all day before a meal and even after a meal at

00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:26.180
 bedtime, unless it drops into hypoglycemia.

00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:33.180
 So what can you suggest might be going on if the blood sugar is not raising after a

00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:35.180
 meal?

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:39.180
 Different things could cause that.

00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:49.180
 It's probably no problem, just maybe the way they cook their food.

00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:54.180
 The way they cook their food, can you elaborate a little bit on that?

00:58:54.180 --> 00:59:04.180
 Yeah, if you cook everything so that it's ideally palatable and well cooked, you extract

00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:16.180
 quite a bit more sugar and starch than you would with the way stylish people tend to

00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.180
 undercook their food.

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:21.180
 Interesting, stylish people.

00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:26.180
 So what's your favorite way to cook a potato you think that works best for you?

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:30.180
 Yeah, what's most digestible for yourself.

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:37.180
 Yeah, so have you found any particular way that works for you the best, what's most digestible?

00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:46.180
 I like well-boiled potatoes that are just falling apart, so they kind of spontaneously

00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:47.180
 mash up with butter.

00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:50.180
 Yeah, like these little red potatoes?

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:51.180
 Yeah.

00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:54.180
 Yeah, kind of fun.

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:58.180
 Here's an email, and plus of course butter, right?

00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:02.180
 I mean, isn't that just like necessary with potatoes?

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:05.180
 For your taste, pretty much, yeah.

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:07.180
 Pretty much, yeah.

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:17.180
 If you take a thyroid T4 plus T3 and it brings down your temperature, how can you tell if

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:24.180
 it is the dose is, let's see, how can you tell if it is the dose is too high, making

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:29.180
 you more hypothyroid, or it is knocking down stress hormones?

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:33.180
 Well, let's see, if it's bringing your temperature down, isn't that good?

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.180
 No?

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.180
 No, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.180
 I'm confused.

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:46.180
 If you're under heavy stress, the thyroid lowers your stress, but you have to measure

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:52.180
 it every day for days and days in a row to see what's happening.

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:55.180
 Yeah, so I was totally opposite.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:58.180
 You want to keep your temperature up, right, in general?

01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.180
 In general, yeah.

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:04.180
 Yeah, especially in the morning, that's when we can tell if our thyroid is happy, right?

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.180
 Right.

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:09.180
 And the Berta Barnes is what, about 98?

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.180
 Want it to be in the morning?

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:12.180
 Yeah, close to that.

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:13.180
 Yeah, yeah.

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:19.180
 And that'll give you an idea of if Mr. Thyroid is working well, correct?

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.180
 Okay.

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:28.180
 Hey, Dr. Peat, are there any commonly sold materials that you think people, oh, should

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:32.180
 stop buying because they're especially damaging to the environment?

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:37.180
 For example, right now I was planning to put down a new vinyl floor, but I was reading

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:41.180
 online that vinyl is extremely bad for the environment, so I'm not sure if it should

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.180
 be hardwood.

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:44.180
 Do you have any...?

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:46.180
 What was the substance?

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:49.180
 The substance says that he's thinking about doing vinyl but thinking it's bad for the

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.180
 environment.

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:56.180
 He's asking you if you have any ideas on some materials that would be not good for

01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:01.180
 the environment.

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:08.180
 The CO2 from what source are they considering?

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:11.180
 Well, I don't think it's CO2.

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:14.180
 I think it's just things like vinyl or other plastics.

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:17.180
 Oh, oh, oh, sure, plastics.

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.180
 Sure.

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:23.180
 The more you do to upset the environment, the worse things get.

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:25.180
 Sure, sure.

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:32.180
 Which is why we take little cloth things to the store rather than have them put on plastic,

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.180
 right?

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:36.180
 No sense piling on if you can't.

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:44.180
 Dr. Ray Peat, is the cause for varicose veins in men the same as in women, or is there a

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:51.180
 slight difference that would Dr. Peat recommend to reverse and remove the appearance of varicose

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:57.180
 veins that are bulging all over the surface of both legs of a man in his 20s?

01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:02.180
 Wow, we have a fellow in his 20s, lots of bulging varicose veins.

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:05.180
 What do you think?

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:21.180
 In both men and women, hypothyroidism has a big role, but the differences are the cortisol

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:34.180
 excess is more likely in men, estrogen excess more likely in women to contribute to it.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:40.180
 And what increases cortisol to levels we don't want?

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:44.180
 Just about everything bad you do.

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:47.180
 Living on earth, right, Doc?

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:56.180
 Yeah, and an extreme ketogenic diet makes you run constantly at a high cortisol level.

01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:08.180
 So there are lots of habitual things that can spend your tissue reserves faster than

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:11.180
 normally so that you age faster.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:18.180
 And what would be symptoms of your cortisol too high?

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:28.180
 Thinning of your skin, so the famous one is the white of your eye has a blueish appearance.

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:38.180
 When you're not getting enough protein, for example, or have too high cortisol, you have

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:41.180
 that blue sclera effect.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:55.180
 But all of the events of menopause are basically identical to the signs of excess cortisol.

01:04:55.180 --> 01:05:02.180
 Oh, so when ladies go through menopause, they present signs that would be similar to excess

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:03.180
 cortisol.

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:14.180
 Yeah, if you enumerate them, someone who's diagnosed with menopause will recognize them

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.180
 in Cushing's syndrome.

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:23.180
 And with Cushing's syndrome, they can say, "Oh, that's just menopause."

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:32.180
 It includes facial hair, loss of head hair, gain of weight and blood pressure and instability

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:48.180
 of blood sugar, food cravings, breaking blood vessels and weak skin that appears too fragile,

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:57.180
 of constipation, diarrhea sometimes, everything getting destabilized.

01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:03.180
 It's identical in both menopause and Cushing's syndrome.

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:04.180
 Interesting.

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:09.180
 Dr. Ray P., Patrick Timpone, One Radio Network.

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.180
 This is from Pierre.

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:14.180
 Pierre, I'm not sure where he lives.

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:21.180
 He doesn't say, "Dr. Peat, from time to time, there will be a little small purple splotch

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:23.180
 on my forearm.

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:28.180
 Sometimes, the size of a dime stays for maybe a week and then fades away.

01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:30.180
 What could be causing this?"

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:34.180
 I, for a couple of years, was having that frequently.

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.180
 Were you?

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:44.180
 And I think it's one of the early signs of developing intestinal allergies.

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:45.180
 Allergies?

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:55.180
 It increases your cortisol and estrogen generally, destabilizing capillaries.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:07:06.180
 But along with that goes autoimmune type of inflammatory symptoms that make you break

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.180
 your blood vessels.

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:15.180
 So, he may be eating something that he's allergic to or could have some gut issues,

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:18.180
 leaky and so on, that he's allergic to.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.180
 Yeah, the wrong flora growing in your intestine.

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:22.180
 The wrong flora.

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.180
 You mean the wrong foods?

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:28.180
 Yeah, the wrong food support, the wrong bacteria.

01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.180
 I see.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.180
 Okay.

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:37.180
 How does Dr. Peat recommend people test their vitamin A levels and what does he consider

01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:41.180
 the ideal healthy range to be?

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:43.180
 Vitamin A.

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:48.180
 I've seen and tested in quite a few people.

01:07:48.180 --> 01:08:08.180
 The things that are regulated are thyroid function, progesterone function and vitamin

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.180
 B12 intake.

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:19.180
 So, you can't look only at vitamin A. You have to see how things are functioning.

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:27.180
 It tends to take care of itself if you're eating a mixed diet because the carotene is

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:36.180
 in all of the yellow and orange plant foods and you can turn that to vitamin A if your

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:38.180
 hormones are okay.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.180
 Okay.

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:44.180
 Robert wants to know what would be the best strategies to lower high cortisol.

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.180
 High cortisol.

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:47.180
 Did we cover that or not?

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:55.180
 Yeah, everything that is pleasant reduces your stress feeling.

01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:58.180
 Everything that isn't pleasant will reduce cortisol, right?

01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:00.180
 Or will raise cortisol.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.180
 Sorry.

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:11.180
 Yeah, keeping your meal frequency up is very helpful.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:14.180
 A smaller meal several times a day.

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.180
 This is from Sylvia.

01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:21.180
 I often have eye bags and I just don't know why.

01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:23.180
 I don't like them.

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:27.180
 What does Dr. Peat think the main cause for bags under the eyes?

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:28.180
 Good question.

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:39.180
 Stress and high cortisol and high estrogen are associated with them.

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:54.180
 Generally, it's a sign of stress or elevated adrenal problems.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:58.180
 Adrenal, get the adrenal up, right?

01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:01.180
 The adrenals get a little hot.

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:06.180
 And just living here in the body will do the adrenals.

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:09.180
 What else affects the adrenals negatively?

01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:17.180
 Eating allergenic foods really turns out to be like bread.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:26.180
 Bread turns out to be enough to give a lot of people a puffy under the eyes.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:30.180
 What about caffeine, coffee?

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:34.180
 Is that adrenal?

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.180
 Coffee.

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:39.180
 Does that affect the adrenals, coffee?

01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:44.180
 Oh, it can disturb them if you...

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:53.180
 Many people drink it without food and using it as a speed stimulant.

01:10:53.180 --> 01:11:01.180
 But if you use it with food, it improves your efficiency of energy production.

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:06.180
 It can either make things much worse or improve things.

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.180
 Or much better.

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.180
 So that's why people...

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:16.180
 So people that want to skip breakfast and they just have coffee, that's not the best choice.

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:26.180
 Yeah, on an empty stomach, coffee really raises your cortisol and damages tissues.

01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:27.180
 Interesting.

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:31.180
 So if you're going to have bacon and eggs, then have some coffee, right?

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:32.180
 Yep.

01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:34.180
 There you go.

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.180
 Well, that was easy. I'll take coffee with my bacon and eggs.

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:41.180
 Sherry wants to know, "My body doesn't produce enough potassium.

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:46.180
 Other than food or supplements, is there any way to produce more potassium in the body?"

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:48.180
 Potassium.

01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:51.180
 Body shouldn't produce calcium, but...

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.180
 Potassium, Doc, potassium.

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:56.180
 Potassium?

01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:57.180
 Yeah, potassium.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:05.180
 It should be able to get enough potassium from just about any food you eat.

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:10.180
 There's almost never a potassium deficiency.

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:11.180
 Yeah.

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:13.180
 Okay.

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:19.180
 Patricia says, "I believe some women after menopause and taking injections of testosterone,

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:22.180
 some of them say they feel better and sleeping better.

01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:24.180
 What does Dr. Ray Peat think?"

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:27.180
 I'm a 76-year-old lady.

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.180
 A little testosterone?

01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:34.180
 Oh, it makes just about everyone feel better.

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:41.180
 But in a woman, it's going to for sure increase facial hair.

01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:42.180
 Right.

01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:51.180
 And in a man, very often at that age, his estrogen is already higher than a woman's.

01:12:51.180 --> 01:13:01.180
 And so, it's very doubtful that it is helping the average man in his 70s.

01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:07.180
 But it will almost always make a woman of that age feel a lot better.

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.180
 Oh, it will feel a lot better.

01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:15.180
 And I would argue too that a testosterone from a food like we promote, pine pollen,

01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:21.180
 is real different than taking injections or BBs and all of the rest of it.

01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:22.180
 You know what I mean?

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:27.180
 I've known people that took these BBs and injections and they feel great for 30 days,

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:29.180
 and then they feel terrible.

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:30.180
 You know what I mean?

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:33.180
 And they say, "Well, I don't know. I'm not going to do that anymore."

01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.180
 Yeah.

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:36.180
 You know.

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:46.180
 So, two questions. What would be the cause of high triglycerides despite following a low-fat diet?

01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:49.180
 And what would be the best way to reduce them?

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:56.180
 So, does a low-fat diet reduce triglycerides?

01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:03.180
 Too much starch can cause elevated triglycerides.

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:05.180
 Starch, potatoes.

01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:06.180
 Yeah.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:09.180
 But stress does too.

01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:22.180
 And high triglycerides are seldom anything to worry about because usually it's just a person is feeling stressed,

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:25.180
 and so they're eating some extra starch.

01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:31.180
 And if you cut back on your starch immediately, the triglycerides will come down.

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:43.180
 Isn't it pretty prolific that stress or needing comfort, then we go to the pasta or the potato?

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:45.180
 To which or the potato?

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:50.180
 In other words, folks get stressed or nervous or just not feeling well, right?

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:55.180
 They go right for the potato or the pasta, right? Or the bread.

01:14:55.180 --> 01:15:03.180
 Oh, yeah. Potato is a good choice because it's almost a complete food.

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:07.180
 And that can help straighten you out a little bit if you're all stressed out, can't it?

01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:08.180
 Yeah.

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:10.180
 Yeah. Good old potatoes.

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:15.180
 Years ago, we interviewed a lady. She wrote a book, Dr. Peat, called "Potatoes, Not Prozac."

01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:19.180
 I always remember that. And that's what she said.

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:23.180
 So, potatoes will help put you to sleep?

01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:27.180
 Oh, yeah. A guy called me years ago.

01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:32.180
 His sister had heard about using potato juice.

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.180
 Right.

01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:40.180
 And he hadn't slept, she said, for about three months.

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:48.180
 And he was basically feeble-minded from the exhaustion of not sleeping.

01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:49.180
 Isn't that interesting.

01:15:49.180 --> 01:16:01.180
 And so he couldn't understand the idea of making juice out of making potato soup out of just the juice.

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:05.180
 In other words, throwing away the starchy part.

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:12.180
 But finally, she got him a big bowl of potato soup.

01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:22.180
 He went to sleep right in place, ate half a bowl of soup, and had his first night's sleep right there beside the soup.

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:28.180
 So how was he making juice? I mean, not raw. You wouldn't do it raw, would you? Raw potatoes?

01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:33.180
 He used a centrifugal carrot juicer.

01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:36.180
 Yeah. That's really...

01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:42.180
 Didn't they, at some point, people were doing like raw potato juice in Europe for cancer or something?

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.180
 Did I dream that? Or are they doing it?

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:54.180
 I don't think it has to be raw. It works okay if it's thoroughly cooked.

01:16:54.180 --> 01:17:00.180
 But I know what you're saying about potatoes, because if I would eat a potato at night,

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:06.180
 you know, Dr. Peat'd like six or seven in an hour, so I was worthless. You know, I couldn't do anything.

01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:09.180
 And I wanted to work on my screenplays that I write.

01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:15.180
 So with the meat, I don't do that. I don't go to sleep. I can just keep writing until midnight.

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:17.180
 So that makes sense, doesn't it?

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:23.180
 Yeah. It just changes a well-balanced, complete food.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:30.180
 Interesting. What if I would do potatoes and the meat at the same time? I wonder if that would work.

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.180
 At the same time as what?

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:37.180
 Yeah. In other words, do a potato and also do heavy protein, too.

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:43.180
 Oh, that's right. There's a standard meat and potatoes.

01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:47.180
 Yeah. That's why it works, because it's a combination that kind of goes together.

01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:53.180
 Yeah. See, I never did that. I always did the potato alone. That's why it probably didn't work for me.

01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:58.180
 Right? What are the dangers of elevated iron levels in the body?

01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:09.180
 The causes of elevated iron and how to reduce them, elevated iron?

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:16.180
 Eating too much iron really is the only problem.

01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:20.180
 Eating too many iron-rich foods, right?

01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:21.180
 Yeah.

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:27.180
 And I think what are some of the high... I know like blackstrap molasses, that's a high food, right? Iron food?

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:35.180
 Oh, yeah. And it's got a lot of anti-nutrients of different kinds, kind of risky stuff.

01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:44.180
 Yeah. Dr. Peat, you've talked about your abilities to affect electrical devices and even cloud chambers.

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:51.180
 My Mac speakers are broken and distort everyone's voice, making them totally undecipherable,

01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:55.180
 but your voice comes through clear as a bell. Any explanation?

01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:58.180
 Well...

01:18:58.180 --> 01:18:59.180
 What do you think?

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:03.180
 For affecting the voice?

01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:09.180
 Yeah. Like he said, you've talked about abilities to affect electrical devices and even cloud chambers.

01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:12.180
 I don't know what a cloud chamber is.

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:24.180
 Yeah. A friend took me through the Exploratorium in San Francisco and after hours turned on the cloud machine to show me how it works.

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:25.180
 Right.

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:48.180
 And as it started clouding up, I moved closer to it and a cylinder, it was a glass cabinet, and the cylinder parallel to my body opened up in the cloudiness inside the chamber

01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:54.180
 and it was exactly corresponding to my movement towards the chamber.

01:19:54.180 --> 01:20:01.180
 And then when I backed away from it, it collapsed the clouded area.

01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:29.180
 So some field coming out of my body was preventing the cloud particles from forming and it was the same shape of a field extending about a foot and a half roughly beyond my skin

01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:35.180
 that I saw in working with lab equipment.

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:44.180
 Many people have a field like that. Sometimes it's as much as a yard away from your body.

01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:45.180
 Yes, sir.

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:47.180
 Sometimes only two or three inches.

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:48.180
 Yeah.

01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:51.180
 But it's an attachment to your body.

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:55.180
 Yeah. Some people call it maybe an aura. An aura maybe?

01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:56.180
 Probably, yeah.

01:20:56.180 --> 01:21:04.180
 And it's an electrical field that we emanate, I think, I believe it's because of our state of consciousness.

01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:14.180
 Right. Researchers have measured that field in the piece of human skin growing in a dish.

01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:31.180
 And then if you metabolically poison that with a little cyanide, for example, so it doesn't respire, the size of the field shrinks in proportion to the energy.

01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:47.180
 And if you wash out the poison, the field comes back. And it's definitely something operating in accord with the respiratory enzymes of the skin.

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:52.180
 But in some people it projects far beyond the skin.

01:21:52.180 --> 01:22:03.180
 Fascinating. Fascinating. I think that's where the whole thing over the holy pictures, you know, with the Christian saints and all that and Catholic.

01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:07.180
 I think that's what that was about. Have you ever seen those holy cards when we were kids?

01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:09.180
 Yeah, I think so.

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:17.180
 Yeah. Yeah. It used to show like the halo kind of thing. And in the movies sometimes they'll show Christ as protected with light coming out.

01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:22.180
 And it makes sense, though, right? And we are light beings, aren't we? Light beings?

01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:33.180
 Well, to that extent, our living fields maintain this structured field around our body.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:39.180
 And the structured field, I wonder what the purpose of it is to attract others or protect us?

01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:45.180
 Yeah, I think it's a communication device when it's operating properly.

01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:47.180
 Communication device.

01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:48.180
 Between people.

01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:56.180
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense, doesn't it? And I think we, you know, I know we can communicate with animals, too.

01:22:56.180 --> 01:23:03.180
 I mean, I talk to the snakes all the time and I think I've only seen one or two in 25 years and I'm in Texas.

01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:08.180
 And I just kind of tell them, you know, I'm good. I'm not going to step on you. I don't want to hurt you.

01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:14.180
 Right. You know, I love you. And and they just stay away.

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:16.180
 You know, they just stay away.

01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.180
 I do that with ants.

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:20.180
 Do you? Yeah.

01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:27.180
 I suppose I've said my roommate is going to poison you all if you come in the house again.

01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:31.180
 It's so funny. I did that the other day. It's so funny you say that.

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:34.180
 So I talked to them, too. They were coming in my kitchen, Doc.

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:43.180
 And I was talking to him, I say, now you guys get out of here because I got to I'm going to nuke you if you don't, you know, I'm going to nuke you if you don't.

01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:50.180
 It didn't quite work. But so they were they were these fire ants and they're hardcore and boy, they just kept coming in, coming and coming in.

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:54.180
 And I finally just, you know, nuked him. It took a while.

01:23:54.180 --> 01:24:00.180
 And I was sad. I mean, I really was in that weird. I felt badly for killing them.

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:04.180
 Ants, go figure.

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:08.180
 But they are little souls, aren't they? They are little little beings.

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:12.180
 But but you've been able to tell them to leave and they have left.

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:20.180
 You know, when you get to know an ant, if you see an ant in this daily location.

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:26.180
 Yeah. And just patiently watch what that ant does.

01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:32.180
 They're the ones I've watched long enough.

01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:40.180
 They definitely have their private life and they're definitely individual personalities.

01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:44.180
 Correct. Oh, yeah.

01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:49.180
 Well, you're fun to talk to. I'm glad you're coming back from your celery voice thing.

01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:54.180
 Just a fascinating story. And I'm glad that your brain is fine because we want you around for a long time.

01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:58.180
 Don't go anywhere. OK?

01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:02.180
 All right. You take care of yourself, Dr. Ray Peat. OK?

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:04.180
 OK. Very good. Love you so much. Thank you. Bye bye.

01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:08.180
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Tampone on Radionetwork.com.

01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:11.180
 Well, isn't that great?

01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:16.180
 Yeah. So I'm just going to retell the story for a minute.

01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:21.180
 About two months ago, Dr. Peat was just like he was really having a hard time talking.

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:25.180
 And I mean, really, you could listen to the last two months.

01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:30.180
 And I was just concerned because he just couldn't get the words out.

01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:35.180
 But I didn't say anything because who am I? I mean, I don't know what I'm doing.

01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:45.180
 And talking to a fellow like this who has been studying this stuff for 60 years or more, renowned nutritionist.

01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:50.180
 So I didn't say anything because I mean, what was I going to say?

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:58.180
 So during the last week or two, I was sending him all these videos that we were talking to these carnivore people with the fat.

01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:02.180
 Because, you know, I assumed wrongly, it's not good to assume, right?

01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:07.180
 That maybe there's something with his brain and he was needing more fat for his brain.

01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:14.180
 I was just trying to help. But he was very sweet and emailed me back and said thanks for these and all that.

01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:28.180
 So it turns out, we hear this morning, that it was a, what happened was he did this celery thing, some kind of celery thing, celery juice or something.

01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:32.180
 And with a product, I didn't get the whole story, you know, totally.

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:43.180
 But it was an allergic thing to celery and it affected his vocal cords similar to what Bobby Kennedy Jr.

01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:46.180
 You've heard him talk, right? It's kind of almost permanent with him.

01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:53.180
 But he was having a hard time just breathing, choking and getting it out and it wasn't a brain thing.

01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:57.180
 So I was really concerned with him, you know, I was like, oh man.

01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:05.180
 So that's the story. And you can tell he's still got a little bit going on, but he's coming out of it just from getting off the vegetables.

01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:07.180
 He's not eating any vegetables now.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:16.180
 For those of you who think I'm crazy for not eating vegetables, not that what Ray Peat says is right, but these vegetables, you don't need them.

01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:20.180
 I mean, in my opinion, I think you feel better without them. I do.

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:23.180
 Yeah, we just, boom, gone.

01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:30.180
 Okay, well, that's what all the carnivores believe anyway, that the vegetables are, you don't need them.

01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:35.180
 So Ray Peat's off of vegetables, so he's a make-believe carnivore.

01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:40.180
 Oh, God. All right, I will see you tomorrow. What's going on tomorrow?

01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:45.180
 Let me look here, let me look.

01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:51.180
 Oh, yeah, we're going to talk about yoga. I haven't talked to a yogi person for a long time.

01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:54.180
 Robert Bustani is going to be here tomorrow at 10 o'clock.

01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:58.180
 And then Kate Kavanaugh, she's a regenerative farmer.

01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:04.180
 We're going to talk more about meat and fat and eggs and the good stuff with her.

01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:08.180
 And then Adam Bergstrom, 2.0, on Wednesday.

01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:15.180
 And then a lady who had an out-of-body experience that changed her life, wrote a book, and now that's all she talks about,

01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:17.180
 which is kind of like what I do, too.

01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:20.180
 So here we have it. That's our week.

01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:25.180
 Jennifer Daniels tomorrow.

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:28.180
 We've got some other things. Cool. Cooking, cooking, baby.

01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:32.180
 All right, I will see you tomorrow, 10 o'clock. I love you all very much.

01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:36.180
 Don't forget, Pine Pollen on sale. This is not the testosterone doc was talking about.

01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:45.180
 This is from pollen, trees, living foods, and it works with the body to increase testosterone levels.

01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:48.180
 Not injections and not BBs in your butt.

01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:54.180
 And can, as Dr. Peat said, help ladies feel better.

01:28:54.180 --> 01:29:04.180

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:10.180

01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:13.180

01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:17.180

 And all the personal emails that come in, I answer.

01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:26.180
 I do it, spend a lot of time doing it because I think that's my job.

01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:38.180
