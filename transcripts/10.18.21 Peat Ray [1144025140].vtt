00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Broadcasting from the beautiful hill country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Well, a very pleasant good morning to you. This is Patrick Timpone, and we're back here, and it's OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 I think I need to move my camera over a little bit so I don't get lost in the picture here.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 And it's October 18th, 2021, and we were just with you about 15 minutes ago, and we're back with one of our fav guys,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 and really just such an honor to have him on, it's Dr. Ray Peat.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 And Dr. Peat started long ago, really working with progesterone hormones in '68.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 He wrote papers, physiological chemistry and physics in '71 and '72.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 His dissertation, University of Oregon in '72, he outlined his ideas regarding progesterone

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 and the hormones closely related to it as protectors of the body's structure, wow,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 and energy against the harmful effects of estrogen, radiation stress, and the lack of oxygen.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 And he's been working with practical therapeutic effects of the various life-supporting substances,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 pregnenolone, progesterone, thyroid hormone, and coconut oil.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Man, see, I'm going to be buying some coconut oil now, because I had no idea there was such a coconut oil guy.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Dr. Peat, good morning.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Good morning.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 So coconut oil is good stuff, huh?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 And butter.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 And butter, oh man, yeah, I love butter.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Coconut oil, what's in coconut oil that we like?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Why do we like that?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 It's the saturated fat.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 It's shorter chains than in butter, and so it's easier to metabolize quickly.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 It tends to heat up your metabolism, burn calories faster.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 You can get fat on butter, same number of grams of fat than on that amount of coconut oil,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 but they're both very safe for your health.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 So coconut oil heats up our metabolism, and Dr. Peat, we want to do that because?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Well, sugar is the other main thing that will heat up our metabolism just by burning the right kind of fuel.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 And the faster your metabolism runs, assuming you can back up the possibilities by having the nutrients,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 everything you need to go ahead at that speed, then everything is easier to normalize the faster you run the machine.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 For example, if you slow down the rate of metabolism and oxidative respiration, you produce more free radical damage.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 So the faster you oxidize, the less damage you get from oxidation.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 The faster we oxidize, the less damage we get from oxidative stress?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Yeah.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 That would be, we could deal more efficiently or better with poisons or chemicals or things that oxidize the biomolecules?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Yeah, to an extent, the free radical theory of aging has a lot to it, but the faster you run your machinery,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 if all the nutrients to do it are present, then you produce less of those toxic free radicals.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 The faster we're running the machine. So the machinery, you're talking, speaking of the metabolism, can you explain to us what that is really?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 Is it the whole energetics of the body just moving faster?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Yeah. If you think of oxygen as the end point, everything tends to fall towards the atoms of oxygen.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 So if you remove oxygen from the system, all of those electrons that were flowing rapidly towards oxygen,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 creating a little bit of water and carbon dioxide, those electrons have no place to go and they are what creates the free radical damage.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 So the rate of aging theory 100 years ago was popular, saying that if you could slow your oxygen consumption,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 you wouldn't age so fast, but exactly the opposite happens.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 So the aging is caused by?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 A breakdown of order and the faster you run electrons through the system, the tighter the ordering is.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 The faster we run the electrons through the system, the tighter the ordering is.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 It's sort of like there's a negative electron pressure when the system is really running.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 In a laboratory, you don't want the germs to escape. You keep a negative pressure sucking air so that nothing leaks out of the lab because it's pulling air into it.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 It's the same with the whole system of electrons flowing from one thing to another.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 If you slow the flow, then they can wander off. They get a positive pressure rather than a negative pressure.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Those are the ones that are random and can do damage.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Wow, those are the ones that cause the oxidation.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Yeah.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 You don't want to just stop the free radical process by using antioxidants because that can, in fact, increase the electronic pressure of the cell.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 It has turned out 50 or 60 years ago, everyone was enthusiastic about slowing aging by using antioxidants.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 Like vitamin C and things like that.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Yeah, and vitamin C is a good example because inside cells, it's an oxidant. If you overload the system with the reductant vitamin C, it can stop the oxidative effect of vitamin C in the cell.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Vitamin C in the cell is in the form of dehydroascorbate. About 70 or 80% of it is in the oxidant form.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 If you overbalance that with too much, you start getting leaky electrons.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Leaky.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 It's the same with some of the treatments using things like an acetylcysteine or anything that donates electrons.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 It's easy to get too much of them and they will tend to disorganize the system.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Wow. Could that explain why maybe a little bit of vitamin C or people have a good experience with a little?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Yeah, all of our foods except seeds and nuts and grains, every food we eat contains enough vitamin C.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 The people who started saying we need 3 or 4,000 milligrams a day, it's true if you live on bread and pasta and peanuts and such, you can get scurvy.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 But if you eat fruits and vegetables and meats, eggs, fish, milk, all of those provide adequate vitamin C but they don't show up in the chemical tests that people use because they were looking for a reductant form of vitamin C which is what we have inside the cells.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 So if you eat meat, the meat has oxidant vitamin C in it which can interchange when we eat it and show up as the reductant form and back into the dehydrated form.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 So why could it be like some people believe that they have symptoms of flu, whatever that is, detoxification or whatever it's doing that would help them but could that just be placebo?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 No, Linus Pauling and several other people advocated taking doses of around 5,000 or so milligrams per day and one of his followers said take it to bowel tolerance meaning up to the point where it causes diarrhea and what it's doing is cleaning out your intestine.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Oh.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 And detoxifying your body.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 So that's what's going on, it's just helping the body to get rid of whatever it's trying to get rid of.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 Yeah and you get exactly the same results from any good laxative.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 Castor oil or whatever.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 Yeah.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 Yeah my mom, they used to give us castor oil when we were kids, Dr. Peat, right?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 We were feeling bad, give us a hit of castor oil, she said go to bed, you'll be good.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 So we go, we wake up and we poop and okay go to school.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Yeah.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Interesting.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Well, Dr. Thomas Cowan put out a video about the cells and what they really are and all of that and we've been streaming it all weekend, I found it fascinating.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 I sent it to you and he was talking about on this video the work of Hillman and Gilbert Ling that the whole things of the cells and we believe inside are not what we've been told and not what the pictures, right?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Not what the pictures that the medical people tell us. Can you explain to us why this is important and what he's talking about?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 For example, one of the pictures in Cowan's video is, I guess it's red blood cells or some, there are nucleated cells that could be, I don't know, frog blood, I skipped along in the video.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 But anyway, the cell shows a ring colored material and then a dark nucleus.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 About a hundred years ago, people looking at pictures like that under a light microscope saw that outer thing as a membrane and Hillman has gone over the microscopic history of biology and shown that all of those main items,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 all of those main ideas of standard biology are based on different kinds of optical illusions.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 For example, that black ring around the cells under a light microscope, all of these is a visual illusion resulting from the different optical density of the cell material and the surrounding material.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 You put a drop of oil in water under the microscope, it looks like it has a nice thick membrane around it. That's nothing but a pure visual effect.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 But it was taken by so many biologists to mean that there is actually a barrier membrane that led to ideas like the sodium pump and all kinds of pumps to explain cell function.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 But between Hillman showing how these effects happen visually or physically and Lange's work showing how you explain the functions in terms of physical states of matter and water,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 he showed that there is a coherent explanation for what people call the sodium pump and so on.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 For example, if you take a piece of hair that has the protein and lots of potassium and calcium and other things bound with it, you wash it free of all of the minerals in an acid solution.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Then you dip this piece of totally dead hair into some blood serum and it will take up the potassium from the blood, excluding the sodium and the other minerals,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 resembling a living cell that according to the standard conceptions would have to be pumping one thing in and another thing out.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 So just by that simple demonstration of dead hair or any dead biological material taking up this balance of the things that are in its environment,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 it's selective and binds them but it doesn't pump anything. It's a passive process.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 The passivity of the whole thing from Lange's point of view explains that it's in our nature to do well in effect.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 It's our nature. So what is it that the mainstream biological virologists and people have been doing for all this time that Lange and Hillman contradict?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 How does that affect our view of our body?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 What's really going on that helps us to understand what our body is doing in these cells if it's not like we're being told?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Ling and many other people were showing that the body basically knows best what it wants from the environment.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 They were introducing the idea that it has to pump things and it takes energy to live. Everything that's in the cell at a different concentration than outside,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 they say that takes energy. When Ling added up all of those things, being alive took at least 15 times as much energy as the cell could possibly have.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Life is impossible from the membrane pump perspective.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 The way science works, you can supposedly demonstrate one pump working, someone else demonstrates another pump working, and all together you need 15 times more energy than the cell could possibly have.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 No one is pushed into explaining how that would be possible.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 What does that mean to us? Are we getting back to the idea that just with the proper nutrients that the body is going to do what it needs to do and heal?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 Very much. For example, the role of carbon dioxide is very obvious in Gilbert Ling's perspective.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 Carbon dioxide is one of the most beneficial materials in the universe. It makes water alive, basically.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 If you're respiring intensely, producing a lot of carbon dioxide, that shifts away from the lactic acid and free radical damage.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 The carbon dioxide has an antioxidant effect against the harmful free radicals. It's the only antioxidant that is successful in the body.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 So that's why when we over-breathe, get rid of too much carbon dioxide, we're not really helping ourselves.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 We're turning up our lactic acid and the free radical-producing damage form of oxidation.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 So what's really going on in the cells is not really what we believed. Do you think it's more like this idea of this goo stuff? What do you think our bodies are made out of?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 I think in the video I saw one picture that looks like it was Sidney Fox's spontaneous formation of microcells where he just heated amino acids and wet them.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 They formed little cell-like structures in a warm medium with amino acids and water.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 They would bud and grow just like living cells, but there was nothing present but amino acids and water.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 So the basic substance, you could say, is amino acids and water.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 The other things, nucleic acids, that simplest form of protein and water, will then select the materials for making nucleic acids.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 So the genes, in effect, come after the living cell and the genes are shaped according to the pre-existing cytoplasm.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 All of that is perfectly understandable by Gilbert Lange's perspective.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 In the 60s, Leningrad included that work of Sidney Fox's in his textbook, but it was so alien to standard biology and medicine that later editions of the book after Leningrad died removed that most important chapter.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 So that would explain the idea that what we think and what we believe, our state of consciousness, as well as our nutrition and our lifestyle, is affecting everything and not genetics affecting us.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Right.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Wow. This job is just the opposite of what we're told, right? All this genetic stuff is like, "We're going to fix the genes and you're going to be healthy," or something.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 Yeah, for the standard medical, biological approach, it's all a machine and they think they understand what a machine is.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 I see. So would that then harken back to the idea that just because grandpa or grandma had a bad heart, we're not going to have a bad heart necessarily, right?

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 No, but the tendency is there.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Where would the tendency be?

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 For example, there have been many historical studies looking at the records of populations.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 Right.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 And it works in animals, too. If you starve grandma, the offspring are likely to be, in effect, malnourished for four or five generations after that.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 But that would not be something that... So it would just be all the way into the whole total organism would have this tendency, right, to be starved or something.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 Yeah, if you overfeed the starved grandma's offspring, then it doesn't have to run that average of four or five generations. You can do it all in one generation.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 Oh, I see.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Like if you start with a baby born with a malnourished small brain, if you give it the nutrients and the support that the organism needs to use the nutrients, a good body temperature, for example, is necessary to grow brain material.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 And so with the right support, a small underdeveloped baby can go on developing outside of the uterus.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 And the earlier you start with repairing the historical damage, the more complete the correction can be.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 And working with animals, people have demonstrated that just by supplying the essential nutrients for brain growth during gestation, they can create animals, a rat or a chicken, for example, with a brain bigger than that species ever had and more intelligent than anyone.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 Fascinating. So that would add to this whole idea of somehow of evolution and how the species evolves.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Yeah, definitely. This proves that our intelligence is a product of the genes only because with an animal or a species that never got very far mentally, giving it great support, you can make it much more intelligent.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Giving it great support. So that would be a really good argument for moms and pregnancy and really making sure they're having all the nutrients.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 Yeah, and in the present situation, not vaccinating pregnant women, the animal studies have shown that every vaccination has an adjuvant that is intended to create systemic inflammation.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 And every inflammation during pregnancy damages the development of the fetus.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 Every inflammation in gestation is damaging the fetus in some way.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 Yeah, thousands of experiments have demonstrated how sensitive the developing fetus is, but the World Health Organization goes on and advocates pregnant women getting influenza shots with adjuvant designed to create inflammation.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 It's probably the biggest crime of history to advocate vaccinating pregnant.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 So these adjuvants are mercury and aluminum and other very anti-inflammatory things and poison, right?

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 Yeah, or it could be the newer plant extracts or fats or things that they don't have a history of creating damage and so they're putting them in as adjuvants that create inflammation, but no one has a history of the specific damage from that specific adjuvant.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 And what are these? These are new kinds of adjuvants that they're using?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 Yeah, in the present, RNA vaccines, some of them are using either synthetic lipids or plant extract.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Have you been learning any more about these injections that are going on? Are they as dangerous as many people are saying in your opinion?

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 I suspect that Mike Yeadon and Suchard Bhakti are the closest to being accurate. They don't agree with each other on every detail.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 But for example, Yeadon says, "I can't see any benign explanation for how this could be done innocently."

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 He thinks there's a deliberate motive to sterilize the population.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 Yes, sir. When we had Bhakti on our show not long ago, Dr. Peat, he was really more concerned about these boosters that he felt like if somebody just got one, they could maybe get away with it.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 It's a mass effect. A little damage isn't as bad as sequential damages, one after the other, endlessly.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 I was speaking with a lady, maybe early 40s, a young child, very healthy and not vaxxed. She actually had intermittent bleeding and things like that, and really disrupting her cycle after being close and proximity to vax people for a night.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 Interesting. So there's something going on.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 Yeah, the Pfizer manual for instructing the people who administered the vaccine, they were aware of research going back several years showing that whatever nucleic acid might be circulating in your blood shows up in your breath and your skin.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 Wow.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 The shedding is perfectly soundly established going back 10 or 15 years.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 So that would be what the shedding is, would be in the breath or through the skin somehow.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 Yeah. And they warned about letting a vaccinated person be in the presence of a pregnant or breastfeeding woman.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 Really? Wow. What about us guys? I mean, we're only hearing the shedding with the ladies and disruption of that. Anything there with the guys?

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 Oh, if it causes those extreme changes in women, there will be some analogous change in men.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 So are we going to, do you think we're just going to want to be around vax people?

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 Yeah, several people have warned that vaccinated people should be quarantined for at least two weeks.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 You know, somebody sent me an article and I haven't read it if it's true, but that's what they're wanting to do with the kids in Florida, some of them, for 30 days after they've been vaxed. But I'll have to check that, you know, that article out. I didn't know the source to it.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 Yeah, they have been talking about a self-propagating vaccine for years. You vaccinate one person and that person sheds and vaccinate everyone around them.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 So the idea has been proposed as a way to spontaneously vaccinate the whole world without having to treat everyone.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 Oh great. Oh great. That's great news. Dr. Ray Peat is with us. Thank you, sir, for being here. Stay right there. We're going to do a quick commercial, okay, and then we'll come back and we'll take some emails. Is that all right?

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 Okay.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 Thanks.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 Stephen Buhner, master herbalist, wrote an entire book on pine pollen previously. We asked him, what's the difference between gathering some pine pollen, eating that, and then maybe taking survival pine pollen and the grape alcohol, the tincture? What's the difference in the body?

00:32:40.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Okay, the difference is pine pollen is probably one of the best nutrient food substances on the earth. And you see, it's made to be uptaken by all of the life around it. All of the other plants take it in and use it for growth. Many of the animals eat it, and it's a very nutrient substance.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 If you eat it, what happens is it goes through your GI tract and then puts it into the bloodstream. And there's a lot of great stuff in it. I mean, it's really high in amino acids and protein and vitamins. So it's a very magnificent substance.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 It's kind of a nutrient longevity tonic food, and it will over time raise levels. But if you really want to raise them fast, you don't want to let it go through your GI tract, hence the use of the tincture.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 And you can click and order this product right on our website. Any of these are thrival links. Take you right to the pine pollen and order away. OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 I wouldn't make so much noise. I wouldn't be so crazy. And pine pollen, this is from Sir Thrival. We do have a couple of the Sir Thrival products on sale right now.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 And that would be the colostrum, which I love this product. I like to mix it with, I actually have some here with some cacao and some organic milk. And I actually put some mushrooms in there too. Some different mushrooms.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 And it's really a nice little drink I like to have in the morning sometimes. And then some of the Groteen product from Shen Blossom. It's a really, the first ingredient in the Groteen product is bamboo pith.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Can you imagine that? Bamboo? Yeah, why not? I mean, panda bears eat bamboo. So anyway, Sir Thrival, it's a great company. They have beautiful products.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 And the colostrum and the digestive bitters are on sale using promo code TREAT20. Kind of a Halloween thing. TREAT20. 20% off on colostrum and digestive bitters.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 Now through the end of the month on any Sir Thrival link. So check it out. Get some Pine Pollen, get some colostrum, some digestive bitters, and I think you'll have fun.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Dr. Cowan argued on, not argued, but made his position during this video that I sent up to Dr. Ray Peat. And he seemed to like a lot of it. I don't know about all of it, but some of it.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 And that this idea of heat and where Hippocrates said, "If I can produce a fever, I can cure anything." Cowan is arguing, or presenting rather, conjecturing that this gooey gel kind of stuff, rather than the way our cells really are,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 and the toxins get in there. And then when the body produces a fever, that it actually is melting this kind of fourth phase of water, the Gerolpolic stuff and the gooey stuff.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 And this is how the body detoxifies with a fever when they've been using, what about the Indians? They go in with sweat lodges and of course saunas and steams, you know, since the beginning of time, really.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 Long time. Indians used to do it a lot. I guess they knew what they were doing.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 So if you'd like to get a sauna, I think it's a wonderful way to keep healthy. I mean, I'm doing great with it. I just love our sauna.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 It's the Relax Far Infrared sauna, and you can get one for $1,295 if you email me, Patrick@1radionetwork.com.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 $1,295, that's the best price you're going to get anywhere. I think the retail up on their site is $1,595.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 And we'll ship you one delivered for that price, and we ship them all over the world.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 We shipped a couple to Ireland last week, so we ship them all over the world.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 And these saunas get really, really hot, you'll sweat, and then it's the Far Infrared technology that also helps the body to detoxify.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 They've actually done studies, it's pretty cool, where they've taken the urine samples of people,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 and they'll see how much mercury and aluminum and every metals that come out.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 You do the sauna for 30 minutes, and then they'll do the samples again, and there's more comes out.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 So evidently, just heating up the body is not only getting it through the skin, but it's actually working through the kidneys, bladder,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 and I suspect more stuff's coming out with the poop as well. I don't know that, I don't think they measured the poop.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 So I think these are a great way to keep healthy, ongoing. You could sauna every day, probably the rest of your life,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 as long as you're getting the good electrolytes and water, like I do, probably every day for the rest of your life, and just be okay.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 Just email me if you'd like to get one, it's Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com, and I'll give you the best price possible,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 just depending on where you are, and we'll hook you right up, okay?

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 [music]

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 From the hill country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 We're talking to Dr. Ray Peat, his website is RayPeat.com, you can get his newsletter just by emailing

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 RayPeatsNewsletter@gmail.com, RayPeatsNewsletter@gmail.com, all right?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 What's your next newsletter on, or the current one?

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 Immunology, somewhat about the current COVID thing, but more on the background of the theory of immunology

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 and how it was directed in the wrong direction by the pharmaceutical industry.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 Paul Ehrlich was a drug salesman, and people knew about the vaccines against smallpox,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 and he was saying his drugs were magic bullets with the precision of an antibody,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 and so he was taking amiss about the smallpox antibody and using it to sell his magic bullet drug,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 and that has taken on a whole world of development,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 because the drug companies like that idea that there's something natural about their magic bullet chemical

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 that is so specific for every disease, it's as good as our natural antibody system.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 And this was all, what, early 1900s?

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 He was working with toxic dyes, working for the German dye industry,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 and found that the dyes were specific for different kinds of tissue,

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 and got the idea that he could vary the dyes with chemicals in addition to the color

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 and kill, for example, an amoeboid disease without killing the host.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 So that was where the magic bullet idea came from.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 Wow.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 What about this idea we were talking about, Doug, and Cowan mentioned, and I've kind of thought was true,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 on the fever idea? Do you think that's valid? You know, fevers and heat and saunas?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 Oh, sure. Just recently I've been seeing the effects of raising the body temperature on people with Parkinson's-like symptoms

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 or Alzheimer's, losing memory and general cognition.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 And if you just even artificially get their brain temperature up to where it should be, around 99 degrees,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 their functions come back pretty well.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 But you have to be sure not to get the body temperature up without keeping the food coming in,

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 having orange juice or milk while heating the body.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 Otherwise, these people in a weakened condition suddenly needing a lot of metabolic energy,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 it's very common to faint when you warm up quickly.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 So if Patrick or other people that are generally healthy are doing saunas, if we're not feeling faint or whatever,

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 we just feel good, should we still, you think, do some orange juice and milk before, after, during?

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 Yeah, before, during and after. It's all protective.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 It's all protective. So I wonder how the heat could be helping the people with these neurological, Alzheimer's kind of things.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Could it be melting some of the yuck stuff out of the brain? Do we have any ideas how that could work?

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 I think it's shifting away from lactic acid, which is toxic, getting the CO2 up.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 Years ago, a misunderstanding in the class convinced me that CO2 has very amazing curative properties.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 One of the students in the class had, I think it was her mother or mother-in-law,

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 she was taking care of hemiplegic for six months after a mild stroke, but half of her body was useless.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 She gave her a spoonful of baking soda in a glass of water and in 15 minutes, the paralysis lifted.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 Wow. And all during the course, there was no recurrence of it, just that one dose of baking soda was enough.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 And in that situation, I think what it did was open up blood vessels in the brain.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 CO2 is a vasodilator in the brain, and so it restored circulation and restored energy-producing metabolism.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 It sustained its own production of CO2.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 My goodness. Well, back then, didn't they, Dr. Peate, in the late 1800s and around 1900,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 I mean, they were using all kinds of these kinds of things, even turpentine, right, to help people.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 I mean, all kinds of different natural remedies.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 Yeah, and scientific medicine, so-called, had as its purpose the elimination of all of the alternative healing practices.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 The AMA was responsible for closing a great number of competing schools using not very good ethics in the way they did it.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 Were they using cannabis for healing at all back there, do you know? Was cannabis being used?

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 Oh, sure, it was a regular.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 Really?

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 When I was about eight, the law had just been passed outlawing cannabis use medically.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 But I had a doctor who happened to have it growing in his backyard, so I got dosed with it for a while,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 but didn't especially feel any benefit from it.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 Interesting, wow. Well, let's take some emails, okay? You ready?

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 Okay.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 So, here's somebody that has some gold crowns and half-crowns, and it was told that there's some kind of infections or bacteria under a couple of them,

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 and advised to remove them. Do you think, Dr. Peate, could there be another way to solve this problem rather than taking them off?

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 Yeah, gold is antiseptic the way amalgam is, but since silver and mercury are much more soluble,

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 they're the worst ways to have a permanent filling, but a gold crown intrinsically is powerfully germicidal,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 and it doesn't dissolve toxins into your body in any extent.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 Yeah, yeah, interesting.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 Here's a lady, she turned 40 in December. I turned 40, and presently I'm struggling with the changes in my body.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 This past winter, I started dealing with migraines around the time of my period.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 I knew immediately that something was awry and started revisiting Dr. Peate's work.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 The migraines seemed to be abated for now, but now I do suffer from premenstrual headaches.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 The most pressing issue currently is that I gained an unexpected bit of weight over the last year or so,

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 and very unusual for me. I feel like I have a pregnant belly.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 If I let my belly relax, my sex drive is also not where I'd like it to be.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 So she's really going through it with, I guess, perimenopause, right, going through menopause.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 Is it possible that I'm still recovering from estrogen dominance, and now my body is in a healing mode?

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 Around the late 30s and into the 40s and 50s,

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 the failure of progesterone is the main problem related to menopause and premenstrual syndrome.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 The pharmaceutical industry was responsible for creating the idea that the menopause is a deficiency of estrogen,

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 when in reality it's a deficiency of progesterone.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 If your thyroid is being blocked progressively by stress or inadequate diet or rising estrogen,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 the production of progesterone is largely the consequence of this.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 So as estrogen rises, thyroid and progesterone decline.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 That means that your digestive system is going to be sluggish and tend to increase the endotoxins absorbed from a sluggish intestine.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 All of those processes interact, so cleaning out the intestine by having very fibrous food every day.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 Very often that will break the whole cycle of migraine and related symptoms.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 But the reason the intestine needs the fiber to work properly is because it's under-energized by the decreasing thyroid.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 So supplementing thyroid is very similar to supplementing fiber in your diet.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 It gets the endotoxin down and gets your intestine working.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 All of those increase the progesterone.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 Just by supplementing progesterone, it sometimes will help to get the thyroid going again and restore, at least for a few years, the proper balance.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 And she was wanting to lose this weight, so would this work on that the same way?

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 Yeah, it increases your calorie burning.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 The endotoxin from a sluggish intestine is poisoning your ability to burn calories.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 And the fiber is mainly from vegetables, huh?

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:23.000
 Yeah, the one I started emphasizing was a carrot salad, shredded carrot with a little bit of olive oil and vinegar and salt for flavoring.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:36.000
 But it could be cooked oat bran or well-cooked mushrooms or cooked bamboo shoots.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 Bamboo shoots, huh?

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 Yeah, those are all pretty safe, bulk-forming, laxative.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 Do you think the, so you can find these organic psyllium kind of powder? Take that, do you think that works okay, too?

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 Yeah, it's not as tasty as some of the others.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the carrots, though, have a lot of fiber. The grated carrot salad, that's why you like that.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000
 I thought you put the coconut oil and vinegar. Do you use olive oil?

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 I like the taste of olive oil better.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 Okay. So, next one here.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 I lost it.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 My mouse is just attacking me, Doc. Hold on a second.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 Do you do pretty good on the computer? Pretty nimble on the computer?

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 Okay, here. So here's a person, dear close friend with Guillain-Barre syndrome. Guillain-Barre, is that right?

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 I think so.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 Yeah, after two Moderna shots. Wow.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 Terrifying months. Been walking tall and proud with a cane and now can move right.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 I told him I would ask your help in knowing more things he can do to continue to recover.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 So he is recovering from this two Moderna shots, but more things that he can do to get rid of this guy?

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 Making sure that your thyroid is adequate for keeping your temperature up.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 You can see changes in nerve function very quickly when you go from, say, 97 degree oral temperature to 98.6.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 Just using a quick-acting thyroid, for example, and foods that support high energy metabolism.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 So keeping that metabolism ramped up there will help the body to deal with whatever these shots.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:17.000
 Yeah, and part of the mechanism by which it's working is to increase your level of pregnenolone and progesterone,

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 which help to regenerate and repair nerves.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 Okay. Any advice for someone, writes Ryan, trying to heal gut issues but cannot tolerate eating high sulfur or high histamine foods?

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 They create a lot of anxiousness and a feeling of swollen, hot brain.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:43.000
 Wow. Could this be from mobilizing heavy metals?

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 Well, histamine alone can do terrible things.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 So the first aid often is just to take an antihistamine or aspirin or maybe introducing a little coffee into your diet

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 because coffee has some antihistamine effects.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 And making sure that your quick-acting carbohydrates are available depending on your individual digestion.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 It might be sugar in milk or orange juice or even tortillas or potatoes or whatever agrees with you.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 So quick-acting carbs are what you just mentioned there.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 Yeah.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 Orange juice, milk, tortillas.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:53.000
 Michael writes to Dr. Peat, "Does vitamin E sufficiently thin the blood to replace daily aspirin use?

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:02.000
 The most recent decision from US Preventive Services Task Force to reverse it recommendation of daily aspirin seems to be unfounded

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 but wanted to know whether it would be good to rotate to introduce vitamin E to reduce aspirin dose."

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 Oh, sure. They both have similar effects.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 But I suspect that the recent anti-small dose of aspirin campaign is just an extension of they have some other drug that they want to sell.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 Dr. Peat, really?

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 Here's one for you from Chelsea.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 "Do you have any idea on what causes ALS aka Lou Gehrig's disease and any ideas how to treat it?

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:52.000
 This is for a 50-year-old pro athlete. Seems to affect athletes at a higher rate."

00:56:52.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 Yeah, about 20 years ago, some guy with a new diagnosis of ALS contacted me

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 and I had never worked with anyone with that before.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 So we sort of fumbled along trying different things.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:31.000
 The things he did included shining a bright heat lamp on the back of his head and neck and back for an hour every day

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 and using progesterone and pregnenolone and thyroid and extra nutrients, vitamin D and milk,

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 just a very protective, general supportive diet.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 After about a few months, he was going to his neurologist regularly.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 The people who started the diagnosis at the same time he did went through the expected decline.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 He declined along with them for three or four months, but then he stopped declining

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000
 and went into a recovery.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 It was less than a year before he had sold his apparatus that he needed to use the bathroom and so on.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 Everything was working again, so he sold his sick equipment and went back to work at the business.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:59.000
 So you're just talking about, Doc, one of these red, what they call these, chicken lamps, right?

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.000
 Yeah, clear front was fine.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
 I'm sorry?

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.000
 It doesn't have to have a red glass. It can just be one of these.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.000
 Oh, just heat.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000
 Reflector.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
 Yeah, just heat.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:20.000
 My dentist, Dr. Stuart Nunley, back in the day before he became aware of mercury,

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.000
 he had what they diagnosed as ALS, right?

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000
 I mean, he could barely walk. He was in a wheelchair.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:35.000
 He met Dr. Huggins, this was many years ago, and Dr. Huggins really had him do a lot of saunas.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000
 That was one of the main things.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:44.000
 And he just dumped a lot of the mercury. He just got rid of a lot of the mercury.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000
 I think vitamin C, too. I think vitamin C, if I understand.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:55.000
 Oh, niacinamide was the other thing this guy took.

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:02.000
 He was in a wheelchair for just a couple of months, I think, before he was recovering.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:11.000
 Here's a 50-year-old man who wants to increase his testosterone level and wants to know what he can do.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:22.000
 The reason around that age that testosterone falls is that, exactly as in women,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
 everything is tending to turn to estrogen.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000
 Stress makes the aromatase enzyme increase,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.000
 so you're probably still producing a normal amount of testosterone,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:46.000
 but it's being modified, turned into estrogen.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:01:02.000
 So the way to raise your testosterone safely is to reduce the stresses that are causing the inflammatory aromatase.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000
 Otherwise, when you just take a shot of testosterone,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.000
 that isn't fixing the mechanism that caused the problem,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.000
 and so it's going to make it worse as you have more testosterone to turn into estrogen.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
 Right. So you don't recommend those.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000
 They've got these low T-centers all over the country, right, giving people shots and BBs and everything?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
 Yeah.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:40.000
 Richard wants to know, "What food source of collagen do you find works best?" Collagen food sources.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
 I like oxtail soup.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
 Oxtails, yeah. That'll do it. Oxtails.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:54.000
 Because of the high gelatin content of the ligaments and tendons.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:05.000
 I found a place, Doc, here where you can actually get from nicely raised pigs' cheeks and jowls and feet and stuff like that.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
 Yeah, if you know how to cook them, they're great sources.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
 Pretty good. Pretty good.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000
 What can be done for inguinal hernia?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
 I-N-G-U-I-N-A-L. Sorry, I don't know how to pronounce it.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
 Inguinal.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:27.000
 Inguinal hernia. Nutrition, exercise?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
 Yeah. D-H-E-A.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
 D-H-E-A.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
 It's usually low when the connective tissues give away like that.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:51.000
 And making sure that your cortisol is in balance with the DHEA and progesterone and pregnenolone.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:01.000
 The cortisol weakens your connective tissue, tends to create things such as hernias.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:12.000
 And the DHEA with aging declines while the cortisol, if anything, tends to rise with aging.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:29.000
 And so, fixing your nutrition, vitamin D, calcium, thyroid function will help to raise the DHEA concentration relative to cortisol.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000
 And what would be some foods that might help this hernia, kind of you think?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.000
 Oh, high protein foods. Eggs.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
 Eggs.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000
 Seafood. Shellfish in particular.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:56.000
 Copper is one of the minerals needed to make strong connective tissues.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
 That would be like lobster, shrimp?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
 Oysters.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
 Oysters. Stuff like that.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:11.000
 Now, you told me like in the seafood department, you like, you think some of the best things are, what did you say, without?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
 Scallops. Is that right? Scallops?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
 Oh, yeah.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
 They're good ones?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
 Yeah, we can get some nice ones here.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:31.000
 Here is a person that's been recently diagnosed with cutaneous lupus and was told it could turn to system lupus within the next six months.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
 Dr. Peat, just share what he understands about this autoimmune syndrome.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:44.000
 It is open-ended question. I realize, good news, I have a life prescription for hydrochloroquine.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
 L-O-N, bad joke.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000
 Okay, Chandra wants, she's been diagnosed with cutaneous lupus.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:03.000
 I guess that's similar to systemic lupus erythematosus.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:11.000
 The skin is often one of the first places you see it.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:26.000
 There is an infectious, it's a tuberculin disease, but I haven't seen one of those.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:47.000
 Several women over the last 40 years have been diagnosed as having essentially an incurable, untreatable lupus causing arthritis and skin symptoms.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:59.000
 They all quickly recovered as soon as they figured out how to lower their estrogen.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
 Lowering the estrogen, interesting.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:27.000
 Vitamin D, calcium, preferably milk in the diet, and not too much meat or seafood as a source of too much phosphate, and supplementing thyroid and progesterone as needed.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:49.000
 They've had their blood tests that showed they had the classical lupus pattern of antibodies, and they were recovering by the tests as well as by their symptoms.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
 Good to have you here, thanks for coming on Dr. Peat.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
 There's an organization, Dr. Peat, called Let's Get Checked.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000
 I bought this little thyroid check thing, and I'm going to do it today.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
 Because I'm on little piggy thyroid, I wanted to see my TSH.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
 It's really interesting, I hope it's accurate.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
 I'm showing people here, you can't see it because you're not on video.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
 It's about an inch and a half long little tube.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:30.000
 What you do is you just take your, and they've got a special way to do your blood, and you fill this tube up with blood.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
 And you send it in.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
 You don't have to go to the place.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
 I think it was like 90 bucks.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
 I guess it's accurate, I don't know.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
 But it seemed like a very reputable organization.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
 The test looks all well put together and very organized and everything.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000
 I guess it would be possible to get a TSH level off of enough blood like that, huh?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
 Oh sure.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
 Yeah, must be.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
 Do you see that whole thing with Theranos and this lady?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:10.000
 This lady who convinced about $100 million worth of investors that she could do like what, 25, 30, or 40 different tests from one drop of blood?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
 Have you followed that story at all?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
 Amazing story.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:20.000
 Oh yeah.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:27.000
 She had no shortage of people wanting to invest in her.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
 Yeah, yeah.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000
 I mean they had big time people like George Shultz and really heavy hitters.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
 Bill Clinton and all this.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
 And it turns out this thing didn't ever work.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
 Never worked.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
 Man.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
 Here's a question.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
 This is interesting.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
 I have a question about chickenpox.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
 It seems that I have it.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
 I'm 31 and quite puzzled.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.000
 If it's really chickenpox, I think I even had it as a child.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000
 What could I do or what kind of question should I be asking myself?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
 Well, if you already had it.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
 Chickenpox isn't really a disease.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
 It's a detoxification thing.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
 Isn't it, Doc?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:18.000
 I think it spreads from -- school teachers are very susceptible to it, even though they

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
 had it when they were a kid.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:30.000
 Being around kids that develop it, it can spread to the teachers and their families.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:38.000
 But usually the second time you get it, it's only a few spots rather than the first time

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
 and cover your whole body.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
 But for this person, probably not much they need to do.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
 It's probably just going to work itself out, right?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
 I think so.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:58.000
 And local anesthetics can ease the inflammation and pain and itching.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:08.000
 Let's see.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000
 I've been doing some pine pollen that Patrick talks about, an elk antler for testosterone.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
 This is a lady.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
 I feel pretty perky, a little bit tingly.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:25.000
 And I'm also doing some progesterone from Dr. Peat on my gums and lips.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
 So it seems like I'm doing better.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
 I'm feeling better.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:36.000
 But should I get some compound pharmacy cream for estrogen to help with dryness down there?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:44.000
 Are you suppositories to moisturize down there?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:54.000
 A few simple things like better nutrition, vitamin A and D and calcium and so on can

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
 help.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:09.000
 But the local moisturizing effect, the amount of topical estrogen it takes to do that is

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:19.000
 being absorbed and spreading all through your body with the usual risks of promoting cancer

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
 and so on.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:36.000
 The whole idea of menopause as an estrogen deficiency is actually a reduction of estrogen

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:44.000
 in the bloodstream while the estrogen builds up inside cells where it does the damage.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000
 And the reason you don't see it in the bloodstream is from a progesterone deficiency.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
 Progesterone.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.000
 So when you don't see estrogen in the blood, it's because it's staying inside cells and

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
 doing its damage.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000
 I bought some of that one that you developed, which is progestes, a little bottle.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
 I keep it in the fridge.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
 Trouble with the fridge is I don't remember to take it because it's in the fridge.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
 But when I do remember, how much do I do?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
 I just kind of dip a little.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
 You just take a little dab of it, you think, every day for a guy?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
 Yeah, that's what I do.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
 Just take a little dab, huh?

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
 And what does that do for us guys?

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
 What does it do for us men?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:38.000
 If you're having any rheumatic symptoms, sore joints, for example, rubbing it in that area

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
 causes the inflammation.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:53.000
 But generally, if your body is turning your testosterone into estrogen, you are likely

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:59.000
 to be losing a general sense of vigor.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:06.000
 And the progesterone, by inhibiting the aromatase, turning...

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
 To estrogen, right?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
 Yeah, yeah.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:15.000
 The progesterone is going to actually raise your testosterone when you're in a certain range.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
 Oh, cool.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
 So it's just a good thing for guys to take a little hit of that, right?

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
 Yeah.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:28.000
 If you don't need it, then it has its intrinsic antitestosterone action.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:38.000
 So a young 30-year-old isn't likely to see any benefit, but rather a blocking of their testosterone.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
 Well, if they would take it when they're 30, right?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
 Yeah.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
 Yeah.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
 Well, you and I are way above that, so we're okay.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
 Doc, stay right there.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
 Let me do a quick little break here before we go.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
 I just want to mention this great company.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
 I just love these people.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
 This is Shen Blossom and Brandon Amelani.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
 He's been doing this for a very long time.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
 He has some incredible formulas.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
 This formula here that I like a lot is called Arise.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
 I take this along with my pine pollen, and it keeps everybody happy south of the border.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
 Very, very powerful for...

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
 But it's working on the entire body, too.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
 Pine pollen's a food, which is great.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
 And this works on the entire body.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
 It's called Arise.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.000
 So, guys, if you're wanting a little help with Mr. Libido and all that...

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
 I'm not married.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000
 I'm still a single guy, so I'm just kind of warming up for something.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
 And then this is great.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000
 This is called a Mountain Detox.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
 And this is a formula that you can take before and after eating

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.000
 that will help your body to just detoxify from different...

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
 all different kind of little things that are running out of control.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
 No telling what they are.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
 And then I mentioned...

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
 Oh, I got this one.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000
 Hold on.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
 Oh, I like this product.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:09.000
 This is called Grotine, and it's really a premium quality, concentrated, plant-based protein kind of formula.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
 One of the first ingredients is bamboo pith.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000
 I mentioned this.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
 It's called Grotine.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
 These lights don't work for it.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
 But you don't need a whole lot.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
 A little teaspoon.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:29.000
 And I put it in my smoothie with cacao maybe or whatever and milk or almond milk or mucow milk.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
 And this is a great thing.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
 It'll keep you going.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000
 You can take this in the morning in your smoothie and, you know, have a good time.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
 And it's just a nice thing to take.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
 So, these are all products from Shen Blossom.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
 They have some wonderful mushrooms.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
 Just all kinds of great things.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
 Minerals.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
 Really, really nice, high quality, extremely high quality products.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
 All from Shen Blossom.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
 OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:03.000
 From the hill country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000
 Dr. Ray Peat is here on the third Monday of the month.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
 Third Monday of the month.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
 Let's see.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
 Okay, this is interesting.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
 Let's see.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:21.000
 Suzy wants to know, "Dr. Peat, the relationship between histamine and hormones.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
 I'm entering menopause 53.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
 I experience increasing sensitivity to histamine."

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
 Wow, another one.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:33.000
 "During my 40s, such as strawberries and chocolate giving me migraines and other foods like meats,

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:40.000
 more than a day old giving me insomnia, taking progesterone, and it has somewhat raised my histamine tolerance.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:46.000
 I'm reading that some doctors think histamine tolerance is a gut dysbiosis problem.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:55.000
 Should I be looking at thyroid or gut dysbiosis or hormones, increase progesterone to adjust the histamine sensitivity?

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.000
 I do not take any thyroid supplements right now."

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000
 That's the basic idea.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:16.000
 The mast cell isn't the only source of histamine, but it's a major source, and it's one that has been studied the most.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:25.000
 Estrogen activates the mast cells to produce more histamine,

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:35.000
 and progesterone has the opposite effect, reducing histamine formation and release from the mast cells.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:43.000
 So for such things as the bladder oversensitivity,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:55.000
 you can pretty much just turn that off by increasing your thyroid and progesterone because of their effect on the estrogen.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
 And we want to get that TSH 0.5, right?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
 Around that, 0.2 or 0.3 or 0.4.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
 That low?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
 That low.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
 So now I'm going to do this little test I told you about.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
 I've been taking the piggy thyroid for a couple months,

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:19.000
 and so if I get this guy and it says my TSH is maybe 1 or 2, it used to be 3,

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
 hopefully it'll be down. I'm feeling great.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000
 Would I just increase the piggy and just keep it until I get to 0.5?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
 Is that how you do it?

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
 What about your temperature?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000
 Temperature when I wake up in the morning, like 91, 98.1, something like that?

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
 That's probably good.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
 Pretty good, huh?

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
 After breakfast, it should be up to 98.6 or 97.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
 Yeah, it goes up. It goes up like after the show, it's up there.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.000
 Yeah, that's the most practical way to judge your thyroid level,

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.000
 but you can back it up by looking at your blood test.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
 Is there a big difference between the little piggy stuff like I have?

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
 I got it from Vietnam, this natural piggy stuff.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000
 And the stuff made in the lab, is there a big difference?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
 Not really.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
 Not really?

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:23.000
 There are a lot of companies that don't really know how to process the natural glandular material,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:30.000
 so if you find the product that works just right, then you should stay with it

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:37.000
 because a lot of the products aren't labeled accurately.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.000
 It can either be too strong or too weak.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
 The good thing about the synthetic is it's very consistent.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
 Very consistent, yeah.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:57.000
 Okay.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:03.000
 Dr. Peat, please explain shedding. I'm just hearing all kinds of things.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:10.000
 I went to an Eagles concert last month, and you either had to be vaccinated or tested,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.000
 which I got tested against my will, but I wanted to see the Eagles in concert,

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:22.000
 so I questioned shedding because I was around thousands of people that had been vaccinated,

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:27.000
 but I really haven't had any kind of experience from it.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000
 Interesting.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
 People are always shedding.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000
 Everything, right?

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:43.000
 Yeah, whether they've been vaccinated or not.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:53.000
 For years, they've been testing breath as a way of analyzing what's going on in your body.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:02.000
 If you put a cold piece of metal under your nose and exhale the hot air under the cold thing,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000
 it condenses fluid, and then they analyze the fluid.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:23.000
 As big as large stretches of DNA and RNA are somehow getting into the air stream when you exhale,

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:38.000
 and rubbing the skin, you can find all kinds of genetic material as well as proteins and other chemicals,

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:55.000
 so you can pretty well tell what a person has been exposed to by testing both their skin and their breath.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:01.000
 Pretty large molecules. It's hard to imagine how they get vaporized.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
 Interesting. Wow.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.000
 We have a lot of emails that we haven't gotten to,

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:14.000
 so next month, I promise you what I'll do is I'll dig into the older ones.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
 If you've sent those in, sorry.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
 I just failed to do that today and just took the newer ones,

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
 so we've got a lot from last month we didn't get to.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
 I'll do a couple here before we go. We have another show coming up.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
 Dr. Peat, this is John. He's in California.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
 John says his testosterone level is 1,139.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000
 Wow. He's 77. His total cholesterol is 266.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
 Estradiol 27, DHT 47.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000
 I do not feel any benefits with such a high testosterone. Is that an issue?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
 That's pretty high, right? 1,139?

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:01.000
 Yeah, but if it isn't turning to estrogen, that's a good thing.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:09.000
 If it was turning to estrogen, he would be experiencing something like breast growth.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
 But I think it's okay to have very high testosterone.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
 It's okay. Yeah.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
 Dr. Peat, this is Julie.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000
 I'm really wanting to try orange juice like you and Adam Bergstrom have been talking about,

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
 but I can't get organic oranges or organic orange juice.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
 I live out in the country near some stores that don't have organics.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.000
 Is it okay if I drink orange juice from conventional orange juice?

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
 Yeah, I use that a lot.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
 You use it a lot?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
 Just according to how good it tastes.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
 Yeah. I have noticed.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000
 I really do think the organic orange juice and juice oranges taste better.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:54.000
 It tastes sweeter, I think, unless it's just a placebo thing, Doc. I don't know.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:00.000
 How about this? Would you please ask Dr. Peat if my organic orange peels and powder,

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.000
 that would be a good source of vitamin C, organic orange peels?

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:16.000
 Oh, it does contain vitamin C, but I don't think it's a main value.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000
 The organic orange peel is clean because a lot of the chemicals,

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:28.000
 agricultural chemicals would be concentrated in the peeling,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:41.000
 but the anti-inflammatory chemicals that are in the juice itself are very concentrated in the peeling.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000
 So the main benefit would be to make marmalade out of it.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.000
 So you think in general, in your opinion, with the conventional oranges,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
 that most of the yuck stuff would be in the peels and not in the juice, you think?

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
 Yeah.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:03.000
 Well, that's good news, really. It's hard to find organic oranges even.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:09.000
 Yeah. When we find some, even if they're bitter, not good for juice,

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000
 we use the peeling for making marmalade.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
 Oh, marmalade.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:23.000
 Dr. Peat, adrenal glands are required for making cortisol and aldosterone from progesterone.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:32.000
 How did progesterone substitute for the absence of adrenal glands in Hans Selye's experiments?

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
 S-E-L-Y-E-S experiments.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:48.000
 It's just the shape of the progesterone molecule that is such a stabilizing function

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:56.000
 that it doesn't have to be turned into either aldosterone or cortisol,

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:03.000
 but in the absence of those, the progesterone itself has some of that function

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:17.000
 in the sense of helping to retain sodium in your bloodstream and to not get hypoglycemia,

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:25.000
 but it's not being turned into either of those.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:34.000
 And if you have, for example, a tumor producing too much aldosterone or cortisol,

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:40.000
 taking a large amount of progesterone protects against the excess of those.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.000
 So it's an intrinsic property of the progesterone

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:53.000
 that can balance either an excess or a deficiency of the other hormones.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
 Interesting.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000
 Here is a lady that recently started taking progesterone, about 30 mg a night,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:04.000
 during the second two weeks of my cycle to deal with PCOS and fibroids.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000
 While I'm on it, it helps me when I stop for the second two weeks.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000
 I feel bloated and discomfort in the ovaries.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
 Any advice on dosages?

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000
 Also, just started tiny amounts of Silomel.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
 You guys are the best. Thanks.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.000
 Before we get to that, when you just do a little dab of the progestes,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
 do you know how many mg we're getting?

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.000
 Because a lot of people are taking 30-50 mg of the progesterone creams.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
 Oh, in the cream.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:41.000
 I don't have any idea how much you're absorbing through your skin

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:53.000
 because people's skin has different amounts of blood supply and thicker, thinner skin.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.000
 So it's highly unpredictable from a topical--

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
 How much you're getting in there.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000
 Yeah.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
 Because they claim you get one squirt for 50, but who knows how much is going in?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
 About 5 or 10 percent.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
 Is that right? Wow.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
 So what about the progestes?

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
 How much is going in a dab of that?

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
 We don't really have a way to measure that, do we?

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:23.000
 If it goes into your mouth, it's essentially 100 percent absorbed.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
 And milligram-wise, can you--

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
 An eighth of a teaspoon is 50 milligrams.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
 Wow. An eighth of a teaspoon.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
 Let me write that down. That's not a lot, is it?

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
 No.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
 Pretty small.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.000
 An eighth of a teaspoon is 50 milligrams of the progestes.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
 But it's going right in your mouth so you know you're getting it, right, Doc?

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:56.000
 Yeah, that's why just two or three drops gives you maybe 15 milligrams.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:02.000
 And so there's no real issues about getting just a little bit too much of that?

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
 Not in that range.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:16.000
 Some people with extremely high estrogen can hardly feel half a teaspoon of progesterone

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
 until they get their estrogen under control.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:26.000
 What would be a sign--before we go--what would be a sign of extremely high estrogen for boys and girls?

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:32.000
 What would be some signs if you think--just to tell you your estrogen is not happy--too high?

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000
 Irritability is one of the main signs.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000
 Restlessness.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:50.000
 And then with prolonged exposure, the breasts develop.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000
 I'm sorry. Oh, for guys, you could actually start to grow some breasts, huh?

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:08.000
 Yeah, and girls often start getting the effects, both the development of the nipples and the irritability

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:15.000
 and the psychological effects of estrogen when they're only around nine years old.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
 Wow. So too much estrogen for the young ones.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000
 Yeah.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:26.000
 So that's what happened when this whole thing happened with maybe soy milk early on,

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
 when that big craze happened years ago?

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000
 People start getting their kids soy milk?

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:41.000
 Oh, yeah. In the animal studies, it made the male young more feminine.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
 Their genitals were feminized.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
 Wow.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:50.000
 And their susceptibility to cancer later in life was increased.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:58.000
 Yeah. I read stories about somehow the Philippines got all hooked up in this whole soy milk craze, Doc,

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
 I guess in the '80s, right, when it all came out?

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:07.000
 And they were starting to have their periods at 10 years old.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
 Oh, yeah, sometimes earlier.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
 Wow. That's not good, right?

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
 No.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
 No. Okay.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:23.000
 In some of the areas where their regular diet included a lot of coconuts,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:30.000
 the age of puberty averaged as high as 18 in those areas.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000
 Wow. What's that all about? Is that good? Is that better?

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:47.000
 Yeah. I think it allows better development of bones and full development of the brain and personality.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
 Really? Fascinating.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:57.000
 So just in general, our culture, these young girls starting their periods at 12, 13,

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:03.000
 it's probably more unnatural than what it would be if we lived out in the woods or something, maybe.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
 Yeah.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
 You think?

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
 Right.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.000
 Right. Well, that's what we get for moving out of the woods, Dr. Peat.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
 Well, it's just an honor to have you here. Thanks so much for your time.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
 And how's your painting coming? You still painting?

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:27.000
 Oh, the weather has been too cold to spend much time outside lately.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
 Oh, so that's where you paint. You paint outside.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
 Yeah.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
 Ah, you paint landscapes and things.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:39.000
 Oh, everything, but just to not mess up the house with paint.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
 That's right. Don't mess up the house.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:48.000
 Dr. Peat's newsletter is raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
 raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
 raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:33:00.000
 He has a lot of huge, just all kinds of articles, and he's here on the third Monday of every month.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
 Dr. Peat, thank you.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
 Okay. Thank you.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000
 We love you. Thank you very much. And you take care of yourself, okay?

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
 Okay.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
 All right, sir. Thank you. Bye-bye.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:18.000
 Dr. Ray Peat, he's the real deal, man. The real deal. What a sweet guy.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.000
 He knows a lot of stuff, huh?

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000
 Okay, we're going to take a little break here, and then we're going to talk to Rulan Xu.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:32.000
 She's a biochemist and a quantum physicist and a really cool gal and a very smart lady.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:41.000
 And we're going to talk about, among other things, pro-euthane and keeping younger with her product, PearlSim,

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:47.000
 which we love, and to brush your teeth, the best ever teeth brushing thing.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:52.000
 Okay, we're just going to get set up here, stay right there, and joined by Rulan Xu.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.000
 So take care. We will see you. Thank you. May the blessings be.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
 Pass on these links to everyone that you care about.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:05.000
 And don't forget, all of our shows are on BitChute. You know BitChute?

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:11.000
 And we have the link to the BitChute page right on the front page of One Radio Network, BitChute.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000
 All of our videos are there. You can sign up and subscribe.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.000
 Prescribe to the BitChute and hit the little bell, and we'll tell you every time we put a new show.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:29.000
 Also, on the front page of One Radio Network, there's a Telegram thing, and you can join us on Telegram.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:36.000
 And then, because who knows how long we'll last on Facebook, every time we turn around we get put in jail for 30 days.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:42.000
 So we're just out of jail for a 30-day stint, and the food was pretty good, and we're...

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000
 Just kidding.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:51.000
 So I love you all. May the blessings be. Just see you in a few minutes. Stay right there.
