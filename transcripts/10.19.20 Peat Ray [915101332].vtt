00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 - Our listener supported One Radio Network.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.600
 - Well, very pleasant, good day to you.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.480
 This is Patrick Timpone, oneradionetwork.com.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.640
 Another week of broadcast for you.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.560
 Dr. Pollard, Gerald Pollack, will be on this week sometime.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.540
 Some, a lot of interesting people

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.880
 that I won't get into right now.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.460
 So stay tuned, check in with our Facebook page.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.080
 We talk about things and also the guests

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.080
 and sign up for our newsletter on oneradionetwork.com.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.260
 oneradionetwork.com.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.520
 This morning, we are going to spend a little time

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.920
 with someone who visits us from time to time.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.880
 His name is Dr. Ray Peat.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.160
 Ray Peat has been studying these kinds of things

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520
 that we talk about in health for just an incredible,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.200
 incredibly long time.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.840
 A PhD, goes way back and studying,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:15.040
 specializing in physiology.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.240
 And he did work on hormones back in '68.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 He wrote his dissertation on hormones, '72, on progesterone.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.000
 And his main thesis is that energy and structure

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.380
 are interdependent at every level.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.380
 Energy and structure interdependent on every level.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.960
 And it's the third Monday of the month

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.320
 and we have lots of great questions for him.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.240
 And we'll say hi to Dr. Peat.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.720
 Good morning, Dr. Ray Peat.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.560
 How are you, sir?

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.520
 - Good morning, very good.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.480
 - Yeah.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.280
 So how does this idea that energy and structure

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.280
 are interdependent, how would this bring a little context

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.040
 to what we're experiencing these days on planet Earth

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.900
 with everything going on with this virus?

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:17.960
 - A Russian soil biochemist more than 100 years ago

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.640
 at the very beginning of the 20th century

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.640
 was trying to figure out how such deep soil came to exist

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.540
 in a big part of Russia.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.520
 Feet of good, rich soil, feet deep.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.640
 And he, over the years, developed the idea

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.880
 of the possibilities that were generated

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.760
 just by the streaming of energy from the sun

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.400
 being absorbed by the Earth.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.780
 And in this stream of energy,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.720
 there are various things developed like chlorophyll

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.720
 that were able to catch the energy acting like an antenna.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.000
 So that a red light, for example,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 that isn't nearly as energetic as blue light or ultraviolet,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.920
 but with this antenna, chlorophyll can capture the energy

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.360
 in a way that is just exactly enough

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.360
 to remove hydrogen from water

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.960
 and attach it to carbon dioxide, creating sugar.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.480
 And following that idea that a certain structure

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.080
 tunes into the streaming energy,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.000
 all powered primarily by the sun,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.520
 some of it apparently by internal,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.040
 maybe nuclear energy in the Earth,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.520
 some kind of heat source in the Earth.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.080
 But the streaming energy,

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.080
 even though much of it is a fairly low energy,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.720
 such as red light, if you have the right structure,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.680
 like an antenna, it will tune into it

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.240
 and use it to build new substance.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.240
 And then that substance can be run through another structure

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.840
 in an animal or in the plant during the night

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.760
 so that the energy that was put in by that antenna

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.720
 from the sunlight can be drawn out

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.280
 just as much energy as the plant put in

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.160
 can be used by the sleeping, the nighttime plant,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.160
 or by an animal to create all kinds of structures

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.800
 in the animal as the hydrogen returns

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.120
 to the oxygen forming water.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.120
 So starting just with water and carbon dioxide,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.240
 the flow of energy creates all of these structures

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.920
 of plants and animals,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.920
 and ultimately can build up extreme changes in the soil,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:48.640
 creating a rich world ecology

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.320
 that supports all kinds of agriculture

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.760
 and industry and so on.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:02.840
 What has been going on for hundreds of years

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.880
 is people extracting too much energy,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.320
 destroying the structure,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.700
 deforesting the continents,

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.240
 letting the soil dry up and blow away

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.240
 so that these stored structures and energies

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.120
 are being depleted.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.000
 The whole West Coast now has been mostly deforested

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.280
 of the old massive sequoias, redwoods,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.320
 and pine and fir forests.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.960
 And they used to store huge amounts of water and energy.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:55.580
 And with them gone,

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.840
 the moderating influence is lost.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.560
 And so the summers become very hot,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.000
 the winters colder than normal,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.480
 and you get destabilized weather.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:15.400
 So the deforestation is really the main climate changer

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:21.440
 that the whole continent has been changed

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.060
 to lose that moderating influence.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.960
 People often don't realize how important

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.280
 that the massive living wood of a forest

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.800
 is during the winter months

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.800
 when there isn't much energy being captured from the sun.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:53.160
 If you look at the carbon dioxide concentration

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.600
 in the atmosphere in the Northern Hemisphere,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.160
 it rises to a peak in the springtime.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.160
 And then as the leaves flourish under the summer sun,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.080
 the atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.920
 So by the end of the summer,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.420
 you're back about four, five, 6% lower.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:22.360
 And a big part, maybe something like 40%

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.160
 of this rise in carbon dioxide during the winter

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.640
 is coming from the trunks of trees,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.640
 the seemingly inert, massive block of wood

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.280
 all across the Northern Hemisphere.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.280
 This is metabolizing just like an animal

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.080
 putting out large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.080
 But as those trunks are turned into lumber,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.200
 they stop refreshing the amount of carbon dioxide

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.200
 in the atmosphere and also fail to humidify the atmosphere

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.160
 as they're using the energy.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.720
 A friend of mine who had an infrared camera

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.260
 mounted on his car,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.120
 driving in the winter,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.200
 noticed big white forms in the dark

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.680
 indicating warm trunks of trees.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.240
 They were standing out like warm animals would

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.780
 in the infrared emissions,

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:42.120
 showing that the trunks of large trees

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.060
 are emitting infrared warmth into the environment.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:53.060
 - So, as we humans just deforest more of planet Earth,

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:58.780
 are you making the case that we can generally expect

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.980
 more variations in climate,

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.260
 warmer and colder in some places?

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:08.260
 - Yeah, unless we spend the next 100 years

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:13.180
 reforesting the Northern Hemisphere,

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.380
 it has already been changed so much.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:22.220
 The trees don't regrow as vigorously as they used to,

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:27.780
 but one benefit is that the total carbon dioxide is higher

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.360
 so that will stimulate regeneration.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.220
 - So, when all this deforestation and the fires

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.880
 are going on in California,

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:44.300
 does that affect someone in Texas or New York,

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.300
 their weather?

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.700
 - When the fires were burning,

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.260
 you could see from the satellite pictures,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:56.260
 you could see streams of smoke going 2,000 miles,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.500
 they were visible.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.900
 - Wow, but not only the pollution, Dr. Peate,

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.900
 but just the long-term effects of what you just described

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.380
 so eloquently on the trees

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.380
 and the relation with the climate,

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.940
 that affects all of North America

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.900
 just from the deforestation in California

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.220
 as long-term weather?

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.060
 - Yeah, and all around the hemisphere,

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:26.060
 the circulating atmosphere goes from Siberia

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.100
 to the US, to Europe.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.420
 - So, there's no telling what kind of weather

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.760
 we'll experience five years or 10 years.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.280
 It could be colder or it could be hotter,

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.540
 just depending on where you are

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.340
 and the way the winds are blowing?

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:49.100
 - Yeah, the weather scientists,

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.660
 up until, I think it was 1976,

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.300
 was that when Three Mile Island happened?

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:01.220
 Time Magazine and all of the mass media

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.500
 were periodically reporting the prediction

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.500
 of a coming ice age anytime in the next decades.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.580
 Since the 1940s, they'd been talking about

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:18.580
 the expected cooling of the planet.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.860
 And then, suddenly, following Three Mile Island,

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.540
 when people were starting to realize

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.880
 the dangers of nuclear energy,

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:35.980
 an article released from the Pentagon

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.900
 just two or three months after Three Mile Island,

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.780
 to create a distraction,

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.540
 that nuclear energy wasn't the danger,

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:52.540
 they started the climate planetary warming fear

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:57.180
 caused by burning coal and oil.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.540
 - Really?

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:04.540
 - Creating a propaganda basis for shifting

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.260
 from fossil fuels to nuclear energy

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:13.260
 because the Pentagon depends on the spent fuel,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:21.780
 the material produced for nuclear electricity production,

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:27.140
 is what the Pentagon uses for making bombs.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.700
 - And bullets and stuff, they do these bullets

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.900
 that have this magic stuff on 'em.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.840
 And so, who did this and what year?

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.660
 - That was 1976.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.900
 - '76.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.460
 - Since then, there's been no talk of a coming ice age.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.100
 It's all planetary warming.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.980
 - And that's, sir, and then '76 was NASA

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.200
 that began the propaganda on the global warming?

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.700
 - Yeah, a paper from the Pentagon.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.300
 - Pentagon.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.460
 So the Pentagon, the war people,

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:04.020
 need this spent material to, I think they,

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.420
 they coat bullets in it, too?

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.860
 I think they did all kinds of stuff, right?

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.220
 - Yeah, they use the depleted uranium.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.020
 - Depleted, that's the word I'm looking for.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:16.580
 - To make super heavy missiles

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.420
 that will go right through an inch of steel

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.600
 because of the high energy and weight.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.180
 - Wow, wow.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.820
 And there are people that are arguing now,

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.700
 if you look at the Sunspot people,

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.960
 are making some pretty interesting conjectures

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.140
 that we are going to experience

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.180
 kind of a mini ice age going forward.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:45.100
 - Yeah, the Sun studying experts

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.380
 are still predicting that.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.500
 They haven't been received very well in the mass media.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.180
 - That's right.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.320
 It doesn't quite go along

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.060
 with the man-made global warming thing, so.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.420
 I guess it's possible, right,

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.780
 that we could experience a mini ice age?

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.520
 I mean, if the Sunspot people are correct,

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.960
 and they're pretty close, aren't they, generally?

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.960
 - Yeah, yeah, within 10 years or something like that,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.080
 10 or 20 years.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.760
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us,

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.880
 Patrick Timpone, oneradionetwork.com.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.740
 It's rayPeat.com.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:30.740
 His newsletter is rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com, right, Doc?

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.800
 Ray Peat's newsletter.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.060
 - Yeah, Peats with an S.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.500
 - With an S, Peats, right, @gmail.com,

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.380
 if you'd like to get on his list.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.540
 And I think every couple months,

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.600
 you get a nice email, very affordable,

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.220
 get his newsletter.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:52.180
 So here we are, gosh, almost to the end of the year

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.720
 with this virus thing.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.760
 Have you had any other insights, Dr. Ray Peat,

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.880
 of what you think could be going on here?

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.660
 Any predictions on how long it'll last?

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.500
 These kinds of things.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.780
 What are you thinking with your research

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.140
 and with your gut about what's going on here?

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.220
 - In what area?

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.180
 - And with the corona, in the corona.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:20.180
 - Oh, if you look at the warnings

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:24.760
 that have been coming for 10 years

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.060
 from the Rockefeller Foundation

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.020
 and then from the World Economic Forum

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.800
 and the Gates Foundation,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.200
 for example, the meeting they had in New York

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:44.340
 about a year ago in the fall of 2019,

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:50.440
 they were outlining in detail

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:55.440
 what to do for a corona epidemic or pandemic.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.560
 They proposed the lockdown

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.560
 and all of the measures were publicized to world leaders,

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.600
 China, Europe, Russia,

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:15.120
 all of the major countries,

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:20.520
 especially those that participate in World Economic Forum,

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:26.640
 were given the plans what to do when the coronavirus

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.120
 mutates supposedly from animals in the Southern Hemisphere

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:40.080
 and become able to infect Americans

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.240
 with the danger of killing millions of people.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:49.480
 All of this was put out ready to disseminate

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:54.440
 as soon as they were ready

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.720
 to actually identify such a virus.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:03.720
 So almost simultaneously with the supposed release

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:09.080
 of a virus or appearance of a virus in China,

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:14.160
 this meeting was going on teaching people

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.400
 how to respond to it, how to be afraid of it,

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:24.400
 to believe that it is going to kill lots of people.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.240
 And they did such a tremendous job

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.960
 of creating fear in the population

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:38.120
 that there were surveys of young people in their 20s

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:43.680
 asking them how many people of their generation

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.280
 did they think would die from it.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.840
 And I think it was a majority of them

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.840
 said it might be several percent of their own generation

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.960
 rather than almost no one in their age group.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:08.360
 So it was a vastly exaggerated infectivity

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.280
 and virulence of the virus.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:18.280
 And if you look at those public records

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:23.280
 of how the thing was programmed in advance,

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:31.200
 there really was no factual basis

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.200
 for identifying a pandemic or epidemic.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.120
 Nothing was really happening

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.000
 that didn't happen every winter.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.920
 In the past, they didn't test widely for coronaviruses,

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:54.120
 but when they did, it was about as frequent

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:59.200
 in hospital patients as flu virus

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.720
 or syncytial respiratory virus.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:08.200
 The major things that cause colds

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.400
 and influenza-like symptoms

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.720
 never were purely influenza.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.920
 They were a mixture, including coronavirus.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.600
 So if they had been testing widely five or 10 years ago,

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.200
 they would have been finding similar rates of infection

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.000
 and mortality every winter.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.720
 So looking at the best facts,

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.600
 it turns out that nothing happened

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.520
 except a planned fear epidemic.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.320
 - Fear epidemic.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.400
 And I guess it would be easy to argue

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.440
 that if people are in fear,

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.160
 then they could feel all kinds of things going on

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.320
 with their immune system and think they're sick

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.560
 and are really sick.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.880
 They can make themselves sick.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.000
 That's fair, right?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.760
 - Yeah.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.600
 If they have a cough and a fever,

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.600
 they were told that that means coronavirus.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.640
 And so they would go to the hospital to get treated,

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.800
 but there was no treatment for it.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.200
 But the hospitals were being paid extra

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.520
 if they diagnosed a corona infection.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.640
 And some hospitals were putting people down

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:37.560
 even after they tested negative for coronavirus.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.320
 There is documentation that some hospitals

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:45.320
 were switching them over to the corona cases.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:50.400
 And in many cases, they were then intubating them

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.520
 and pumping oxygen-rich air into their lungs.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:01.160
 And in the best circumstances,

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.640
 when you put someone on a respirator for several days,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.640
 their likelihood of ever coming off the respirator alive

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.960
 is very small.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:22.880
 So much of mortality was the result of the treatment.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.560
 For example, an Italian doctor working in Europe

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:32.880
 wrote articles on proper treatment

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.600
 of people with respiratory disease.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:41.440
 And he, after outlining his proper treatment,

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:47.320
 a gentle provision of a small amount of extra oxygen,

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:53.080
 but not under pressure, not forcing it in,

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:59.280
 in his hospital, there were zero deaths

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.200
 from respiratory disease.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.200
 And a hospital also in Berlin, I think it was,

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:11.120
 nearby hospital, the mortality rate

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.480
 of respiratory patients was 60%.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:20.640
 So an all or nothing difference

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.040
 simply depending on a scientific treatment

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.640
 or a panic-induced treatment.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.080
 - Wow, it's amazing that this continues to go on.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:38.080
 Now we, is it true, in your opinion,

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:44.600
 that these tests just don't show

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.680
 that someone actually has some unique,

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:53.360
 virulent, communicable, potentially deadly virus to share?

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.720
 - Since the best figures on the death rate per infection,

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:10.320
 when you confirm an infection,

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.120
 the death rate is 1/8 of a percent,

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:22.160
 right down with the annual so-called influenza infections,

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.960
 which usually consisted of a mixture of either bacteria

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.640
 or different viruses or the influenza virus or a mixture,

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.880
 or in about half the cases,

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.040
 they couldn't identify a pathogen.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.160
 It was probably just stress-induced pneumonia,

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.080
 which happens in old people.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:52.600
 Their intestine stops working, they absorb endotoxin,

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.880
 that creates serotonin and histamine,

00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:00.880
 which cause edema of the lungs and pneumonia.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:07.400
 So as far as the evidence actually connects

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:13.760
 deaths to confirmed corona infection,

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.160
 it's no more deadly than what has happened

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.860
 every winter, basically forever.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.880
 Basically forever.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.480
 Dr. Ray Peat, stay right there, sir.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:29.480
 Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.760
 Well, it's just very curious what's going on, isn't it?

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.080
 Glad you could join us today.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:36.920
 It's a pleasure to be here.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.840
 We are live with Dr. Peat on October 19th.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.680
 We're gonna do some shows live.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.600
 Dr. Peat doesn't do the camera thing.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.720
 He isn't all set up like me.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.720
 He's not a geeky guy, and so he is just on the phone.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.040
 And so we're doing him live.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.160
 So you can get your questions in.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.200
 We have a lot.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.560
 We're gonna get to 'em all.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.920
 There's a nice big sale going on right now

 have been shown to be very effective

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.760
 with helping the digestion on all levels.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:45.840
 And these bitters are nice.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.040

 Actually, put one in your glove compartment

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.040
 if it doesn't get too hot in there,

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.240
 and then you can, if you go out to eat,

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.760
 you can do that before you go in.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.200
 And also, a little bit of colostrum.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.560
 Dr. Massey has said that it could be

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.560
 a really nice thing to do as well before you go out to eat,

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:11.120
 that it helps any kind of strange usual suspects

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.960
 that you might get in restaurant food

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.960
 to not cause as much problems in your tummy.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.460
 So you can do both of those.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.200
 So it's all about digestion now.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.040
 Great sale.

 We're gonna talk to Gerald Pollack tomorrow.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.600
 I believe he's here.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.460
 Here's physicist, biologist, chemist,

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.060
 Dr. Gerald Pollack on far infrared saunas.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.300
 - Infrared energy is what builds this fourth phase of water.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.200
 And the idea of a sauna, you know,

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.600
 you go in and you sweat and you receive this infrared energy

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.500
 and you feel great after you come out.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.520
 I felt the same and so have so many people.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.920
 And most of us think, well, you know,

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.680
 it's just some sort of psychological issue.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.300
 And it might be.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:06.200
 However, experimentally, we know that infrared energy

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.640
 builds the fourth phase.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.080
 Your cells should be filled with this fourth phase.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.840
 But you know, we tend to be somewhat dehydrated

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.620
 and missing some of this fourth phase.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.740
 And so what happens is if you subject yourself to infrared,

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.780
 the infrared is absorbed by your body,

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.280
 absorbed by your cells,

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.560
 and it converts ordinary water to fourth phase water.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.240
 And then you feel better.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.600
 - Isn't that really cool that according to Pollack,

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.440
 and again, we're gonna talk to him tomorrow,

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.900
 it's been several years.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.120
 He's really part of an interesting fellow.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.720
 According to him that, you know, the infrared,

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.960
 far infrared, I suspect the near does too.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.040
 I don't know.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.040
 It actually helps structure the water in your body.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.080
 He was saying the far infrared turns your body

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.920
 into more of this fourth phase stuff.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.400
 And this is the same goo that Dr. Thomas Cowan argues

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.720
 and others that are in the blood vessels

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:10.160
 that are really encouraging the blood to go around the body

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.280
 you know, like the sap and trees,

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.760
 this fourth phase of water in the blood vessels.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.320
 And it's not the heart,

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.280
 according to Dr. Cowan's arguments and research,

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.520
 it's not the heart that's pumping everything.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:28.200
 It is really the whole body that's doing the pumping

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.200
 through this fourth phase of water.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.800
 So you'll probably hear from Dr. Pollack

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.640
 maybe Thursday or so, but stay tuned.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.460
 We'll let you know.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.680
 We're gonna record it tomorrow.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.240
 And then we're gonna have it this week.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:45.240
 Dr. Gerald Pollack on oneradionetwork.com.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:51.320
 And if I hit the right button here,

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.280
 I think we're gonna be just fine.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:57.520
 - We talk about your health, wealth, and well-being

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.960
 on oneradionetwork.com.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.520
 - And we're talking with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.160
 He's kind enough to come by and visit with us

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.360
 on the third Monday of every month.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.480
 And as I said before, we generally are able to do it live

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.120
 'cause we're just doing a telephone thing.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.600
 We still got a few clicks on your line,

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.360
 but I don't think it's a show, stop, or doc,

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.200
 so we're just gonna continue.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.640
 But you may wanna call your little phone company later

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.720
 and say, "Would you check my clicks?"

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.980
 But who knows?

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.420
 My goodness.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:34.140
 So before we start taking some emails,

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.480
 I'm sure you've heard all the talk about the exosomes

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.880
 and the cow ins, and there's some people in the world

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.680
 that are really arguing that there really, really isn't

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:49.000
 some virus going around that you and I are getting,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.320
 that the body's creating these exosomes

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.800
 when they get poisoned,

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.040
 and that's what we're sharing in all of that.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.920
 I think the last time we talked,

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.000
 you were kind of a, kind of sorta on that idea,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 not necessarily all in, but some of it.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.400
 - I think all organisms have been shedding

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.400
 their genetic information in different ways,

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:21.400
 and the exosomes, pretty much for the last 50 years,

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:29.080
 they've been identified, it's only the last 15 years

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.780
 that there's really much study going on.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:38.720
 And internally, they are now recognized

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.560
 as a maintenance repair process.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:47.520
 When a tissue is under stress,

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.720
 it sends out these exosomes secreted

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:56.860
 into the bloodstream and lymphatic system,

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.200
 and they're carried to the bone marrow, for example,

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:05.200
 where replacement cells and repair cells can be made.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:12.280
 So there's a two-way communication going constantly,

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.000
 and it increases under stress.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.740
 And some of these can escape,

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:23.440
 for example, from the lungs.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:28.440
 Coughing or sneezing can blow saliva and mucus

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.900
 into the air, carrying some of these exosomes.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:37.900
 And so it is only a new branch of biology,

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:45.060
 but the basis has been understood for 80 years or more

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:51.460
 that there seems to be sharing of genetic information

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.860
 across species all over the world.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:33:01.320
 Genes or fragments of genes are drifting around

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.480
 and being absorbed by other species.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.480
 And viruses have a structure similar to these exosomes,

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:16.600
 which they're named exosomes with reference

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.800
 to the individual cell that creates them,

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.240
 and they're external to the cell,

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.200
 but they've been studied

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.160
 as an internal communication process,

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.040
 but they're also exosomes in the sense

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.480
 of being external to the body.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:40.480
 And in that situation, then they can function as viruses.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.480
 And under an electron microscope,

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:49.720
 many of them have a complicated structure

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.360
 and can be confused for virus particles.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:59.400
 And in fact, there are no very good

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:04.040
 electron microscope studies confirming

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.000
 that there is such a thing as a coronavirus

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.360
 in these infected people.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:15.360
 The coronavirus has been imaged over the last 20 years,

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:20.120
 but this particular coronavirus,

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.440
 no one has caught enough of them

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:28.440
 to really study it visually under the microscope.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.560
 - Yeah, so that's what Cowan's group has argued,

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.920
 that they have people out there looking for it,

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.600
 but nobody's ever really found it.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.760
 So you're saying that only because

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.720
 they just haven't found enough of it?

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:51.720
 - Yeah, and the testing is now somewhat more scientific.

00:34:51.720 --> 00:35:00.560
 For a while, they were mixing together PCR tests

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:05.560
 which simply amplify any trace of nucleic acid

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:11.080
 that resembles those in the virus.

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:16.080
 And those tests were even questionable

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:22.640
 since no one proved that the original sample

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.640
 that they used as a reference,

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:30.640
 that that was actually present in the infected people.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.960
 So the PCR test itself,

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:39.080
 its meaning was not generally agreed on.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:44.080
 And then the antibodies based on a blood test

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.680
 were being mixed in,

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.240
 and all of these positive tests

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:56.240
 with their different meaning were being called cases

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.520
 even though the person wasn't sick.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:02.880
 A positive test in a healthy person

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.880
 still allowed them to be called a case of coronavirus.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.360
 And in some cases,

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:16.080
 if they happened to die of any cause

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.080
 after having a positive test,

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.520
 they were put down as a coronavirus death.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:27.560
 And there is now called a rapid antigen test

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:34.200
 which uses traditional immunology tests

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:40.600
 to identify different antigens on the virus.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:46.680
 And so that seems like a more reasonable test

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.960
 assuming that they had the real thing

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.440
 to standardize their test on.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.240
 - Do they have the real thing to standardize their test?

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.560
 - That's what is in question.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.400
 - We don't know.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.120
 We don't know.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.680
 - Hmm.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:10.600
 Well, I guess as long as the world in general

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.240
 continue to connect Dr. Peat,

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.040
 the testing positive with cases,

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.720
 this is just going to go on, it seems like, right?

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.800
 I mean, there's more lockdowns in Europe and in France

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:28.600
 and the UK are doing passports for people with,

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.160
 as you see this,

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.960
 what they're proposing in the UK

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.240
 is if you test positive,

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.720
 or if you test negative, you'll get a little passport

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.640
 and you can go out without a mask.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.440
 And if you test positive, well, then you can't.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.280
 - Yeah.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.440
 And the rising number of cases

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:51.280
 in the places that I've looked at the data,

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.280
 the increasing testing has corresponded exactly

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.840
 to the increased number of cases.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:04.680
 And so if you test 10 times as many people

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.360
 this week as you did last week,

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.440
 it looks like you have 10 times as many cases.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.960
 And so you have an epidemic of testing

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.480
 rather than a natural sickness epidemic.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.840
 - Yes, sir.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.240
 Well, very, very curious.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.120
 Ray Peat is with us,

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.240
 Patrick Timpone, oneradionetwork.com.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.600
 Let's dig into a few emails for you, Dr. Peat.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.640
 This is from Grace.

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.640
 She says, "Broda-Barnes method

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:39.520
 "for diagnosing thyroid issue is simple.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.040
 "Physicians do not agree with this method or diagnosis.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:48.040
 "If a male or female over 55 low body temperatures

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:53.840
 "consistently decides to supplement thyroid,

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:58.840
 "which one seems like an optimal option?"

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:04.840
 "Sinomal or Sinoplus, and why the preference?"

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:10.720
 - Oh, Sinoplus or Sinoplus is the balanced T4, T3

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:16.680
 in a four to one ratio,

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:20.640
 which is similar to the glandular tissue

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.640
 that occurs in humans, pigs, and cows and so on.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:31.160
 And so for the first 100 years of thyroid supplements,

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:37.800
 they used the meatpacking industry's thyroid glands

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:44.520
 dehydrated, and that is what Broda-Barnes researched

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.320
 in the 1930s when he wrote this book,

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.160
 Solved the Riddle of Heart Attacks, for example,

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:59.140
 and Hypothyroidism, the Unsuspected Illness.

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:05.360
 He was doing actually fieldwork, empirical study,

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:12.480
 showing the association of the metabolic rate

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:17.600
 and the symptoms of hypothyroidism.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.600
 And at that time, the recognized absolute

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:27.920
 definition of hypothyroidism was to measure

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:32.920
 the oxygen consumption or the carbon dioxide production,

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:38.880
 same thing, but the oxygen consumption per minute at rest.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:46.080
 And that, it took an apparatus that cost a couple hundred

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:52.280
 dollars that many doctors had in their offices

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:57.280
 and the patient would just come in before eating,

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:03.360
 lie down quietly, and breathe through the machine

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.120
 for two or three minutes.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:11.120
 And if they were hypothyroid, they would only use

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:16.040
 a very small amount of air per minute.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.400
 If they were hypothyroid, they could go through

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:24.400
 the reservoir of air in half the time or a fourth

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:29.520
 of the time, so it's very easy to do

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.420
 and is absolutely definitive.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:38.600
 A person can't live on half the normal amount of oxygen

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:45.080
 if they're producing energy, if the energy is flowing

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.880
 through their system at a proper rate.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:52.360
 And that reduced flow of energy is what leads

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:57.360
 to the accumulation of jellied edema under their skin

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:07.040
 is where you see it, a thickening of the subcutaneous

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.520
 layers and thickening of the blood vessels,

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:17.520
 increasing blood pressure problems, strokes,

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.760
 everything circulatory and dependent on energy

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.520
 becomes a problem when the energy isn't flowing

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.240
 through the system.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:32.720
 And Broderbarnes found that simply taking

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.600
 the temperature orally, well, he advocated

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:42.400
 under the armpit temperature, if you would lie

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:47.400
 for 10 or 15 minutes with a thermometer in your armpit,

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:53.240
 he found that that was as reliable as the oxygen test

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:59.680
 almost, but he was, most of his career,

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:05.760
 he worked in Colorado Springs where the climate is cool

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:11.760
 and so hypothyroid people would be exposed most of the year

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:16.840
 to a cool climate and so their low temperature

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.800
 always showed up.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:23.800
 I found that in a warm Eugene summer

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:29.080
 where the humidity is high, many hypothyroid people

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.440
 during the summer would have approximately

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.480
 normal temperatures, but their heart would still

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:41.200
 be pumping very, very slowly, sometimes way down

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:46.200
 into the 35 to 40 beats per minute range.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.720
 Never up into the 75 to 85 range

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:56.720
 where a normal metabolizing person has a heart rate

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.480
 even during warm weather.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:06.760
 So his temperature basis for diagnosis

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:13.120
 was extremely scientific, but it was dismissed

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.520
 under the influence of drug company advertising

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.360
 when a product, Synthroid, came on the market

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:27.240
 which consisted only of thyroxine T4.

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:33.280
 That was tested on young men, healthy young men,

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:41.200
 medical students, no women were tested

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:46.200
 and they found that the effect of synthetic thyroxine

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:51.600
 was the same as the standardized glandular

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:56.960
 armor thyroid product and on that basis of equivalency,

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:04.280
 they then began testing the blood content of iodine

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:13.600
 to confirm the presence of the thyroid hormone.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:20.280
 So first they didn't test the Synthroid on females

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:26.200
 and females have several times the incidence

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.680
 of low thyroid problems because of the effect

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.760
 of estrogen blocking thyroid secretion.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:40.240
 And so all of the women who were getting along

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:45.440
 with a glandular thyroid supplement were shifted

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:49.160
 over to synthetic thyroid and began suffering

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:53.480
 the symptoms of hypothyroidism.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:59.520
 And in that population of improperly treated,

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:03.680
 mostly women, most of the patients were women,

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:09.960
 they found that the blood tests showed very few women

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:16.720
 were actually deficient in protein-bound iodine

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:23.200
 and so they said even though someone has hypothyroid symptoms

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:29.120
 95% of those showed that they have enough iodine

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.240
 in the blood so they created the illusion based

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:41.720
 on an improper diagnosis of who is hypothyroid

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:46.720
 to say that only 5% of the people have any blood evidence

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:53.320
 of hypothyroidism and after using that test

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:57.240
 for about 20 years, they discovered it had absolutely

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:02.240
 no relation to hypothyroidism and at that point

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:08.400
 they shifted to testing the thyroid stimulating hormone TSH

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:14.920
 as the technology developed to measure that very small

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:19.920
 trace hormone in the blood and so that test

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:25.120
 which became very specific and technically accurate

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:30.880
 was imposed on this false belief that 95% of the population

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:41.840
 are not hypothyroid and so they stretched the definition

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:47.120
 of what the normal TSH should be to fit this untreated

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:54.500
 hypothyroid, mainly female population.

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:59.900
 So now we have the dogmatic medical opinion

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:03.980
 that no one should receive a thyroid supplement

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:08.980
 if their TSH is in the range of from 0.5

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:15.460
 to usually now 4.5 on the scale

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:21.540
 and I've never seen anyone at all healthy

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.300
 who had two or higher on that scale

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:31.220
 and the healthiest populations are in the range below 0.4.

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:36.380
 - On the TSH, on the TSH.

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:41.380
 - Yeah, so what the diagnostic standard is now for normal

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:49.580
 includes very few normal functionally healthy people

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:55.740
 but it's simply saying that being hypothyroid

00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:00.500
 is now normal for the American population.

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:01.900
 - Oh, what a fascinating.

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:06.900
 - And if you're the average hypothyroid person

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:14.780
 then the combination T4, T3 product of Sinoplus

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:21.740
 is going to most likely take care of your symptoms.

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:27.260
 The T3, it has become popular among bodybuilders

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:33.860
 because you can instantly get hyperthyroid

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:39.020
 and it can be very stressful to take a replacement dose

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:44.740
 of T3 very suddenly.

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:51.060
 They tend to take a whole tablet at once

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:56.620
 and the body produces only about at most a 10th

00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:01.960
 of a tablet equivalent per hour.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:08.260
 So the doses they're using in bodybuilding and so on

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:13.260
 are about 10 times too high.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.940
 T3 can be useful, for example,

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:20.060
 first time I heard about its use was a woman

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.820
 who was in a hypothyroid coma

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:29.320
 while taking four grains equivalent

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:34.320
 or 400 micrograms of Synthroid.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.260
 The more Synthroid she took,

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.780
 the deeper she went into the coma.

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:43.060
 And within two or three hours of giving

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:47.300
 the right amount of T3 intravenously,

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.900
 she was out of the coma

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:52.980
 and immediately returned to good health.

00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:59.220
 So some T3 is absolutely essential

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:03.960
 and women are the most likely to be deficient

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.340
 in the ability to make their own T3.

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:10.740
 So occasionally, small amounts of T3

00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:14.860
 can bring a person out of a problem

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:18.540
 but the maintenance should be the combination

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:23.660
 either a glandular or a Sinoplus.

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.600
 - And the Sinoplus and those,

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.260
 people get those at those Mexican pharmacies, right?

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.740
 You talked about.

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:31.140
 - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:35.500
 But the T3, like you were saying,

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.340
 if you're gonna mess with that,

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:38.320
 you just do a very little bit, right?

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.660
 - Yeah, a tenth of a tablet.

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:43.220
 - Tenth of a tablet.

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:46.080
 - Gives you a very noticeable acceleration

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:49.540
 of your heart rate and oxygen consumption.

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:53.000
 - Tenth of a tablet.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.920
 Those are small little tablets.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.600
 It's pretty tricky to do a tenth, right?

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.460
 With, I guess, with a razor blade or?

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.460
 - Or you can get a pill crusher

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.740
 and just make powder out of it and then.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:04.880
 - Divide it up.

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:05.940
 - Yeah, divide it.

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:06.780
 - Yeah.

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:10.260
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone, oneradionetwork.com.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.180
 Here is Thomas and he's in Sweden

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:16.180
 and Thomas has frequent headaches

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:18.260
 and what I've come to understand lately,

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:23.000
 they're kind of, I guess, would be classified as migraines.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.980
 For some reason, the trypanoclostomy,

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:30.780
 the trypan class of migraine drugs

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.460
 that work on raising serotonin,

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:36.820
 at least as I understand it, seem to work quite well

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.860
 where no other pain medications has done much at all for me.

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:44.100
 I'd be very interested to hear Dr. Peat's general idea

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:45.700
 about the cause of migraines,

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:48.740
 especially since, as most know by now,

00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.020
 he's no fan of serotonin.

00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:55.580
 - My own experience with migraines

00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:59.700
 was what got me interested in endocrinology many years ago

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:05.820
 and I soon found out that women have the majority

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:11.300
 of migraines just like they have the majority

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:16.300
 of hypothyroidism about the same frequency

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:19.040
 because it's very closely related.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:24.980
 And vasodilation in the brain

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:30.500
 or swelling of arteries is one of the problems

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:36.380
 and constricting arteries can stop the problem

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:41.860
 but the trouble is that serotonin slows metabolism,

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:47.620
 can interfere with the actual production

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:52.620
 of active T3 hormone and it tends to constrict veins

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:58.620
 and the outflow of blood as well as the arteries

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:04.080
 that are causing the throbbing and pain.

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:10.220
 So even though it can stop the throbbing pain,

00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:15.580
 it isn't solving the problem.

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:20.580
 And serotonin turns out to be high in migrainers

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:25.620
 and that's been known from the early days

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:29.820
 of studying serotonin metabolism.

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:34.380
 They saw that both histamine and serotonin

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:39.380
 are increased in migrainers during an attack.

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:44.500
 And my own experience was that thyroid supplements

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:50.740
 were the main preventive thing

00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:55.120
 but I had also noticed that skipping a meal,

00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:01.060
 for example, on the weekend when I changed my meal schedule

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:05.940
 was when I would end up with a migraine.

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:10.060
 And that's a common experience.

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:13.600
 The low blood sugar and interference

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.580
 with the intestines rhythm,

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:21.600
 going back to the 1920s,

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:26.140
 a medical professor demonstrated,

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:30.920
 he was arguing that headaches aren't caused by toxins

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:32.500
 but by pressure.

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:37.500
 And he had his medical students stuff cotton wads

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:42.940
 into their rectums and the next day,

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:47.940
 those who suffered from migraines and other headaches

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.300
 reported that they had their headache,

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:55.220
 demonstrating that in a sensitive person,

00:55:55.220 --> 00:56:00.220
 pressure in the lower intestine would bring on a headache.

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:05.380
 And that helps to explain why changing your meal rhythm

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:09.500
 helps to bring on a headache

00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:13.540
 because especially if you have eaten

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.620
 something that's hard to digest,

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:18.700
 that irritates the intestine

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:24.700
 and tends to cause congestion or pressure in the intestine,

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:30.820
 when that's combined with a declining blood glucose,

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:37.140
 that combination is what triggers the headache.

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:39.420
 And so thyroid supplements

00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:42.780
 decrease the irritability of the intestine,

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:44.600
 keep your blood sugar steady.

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:47.860
 But added to that,

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:52.860
 if you have a daily carrot or other fiber in your diet,

00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:58.540
 that helps to avoid stasis and congestion in the intestine,

00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:06.500
 that combination is preventive of the headaches

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:12.500
 and also happens to prevent surges

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.580
 of histamine and serotonin.

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:18.420
 The intestine is the source

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:21.500
 of almost all the body's serotonin.

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:27.420
 95% of the serotonin is produced in the intestine

00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:33.020
 and transported through the blood to the lungs

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:35.740
 where most of it is detoxified.

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:41.740
 And if there's extra inflammation in the intestine

00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:46.880
 from pressure or undigested food,

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:52.100
 then the burden on the lungs

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:57.100
 to detoxify the serotonin is increased.

00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:00.780
 And a decrease in blood sugar

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:05.740
 lowers the ability to detoxify the serotonin.

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:09.940
 And then you get the veins of the brain

00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:13.860
 that are constricting,

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:19.540
 allowing congestion of the volume of blood

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:23.260
 in the head increases

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:27.460
 even though the consumption of oxygen

00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:29.540
 and sugar has decreased.

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.620
 So it turns out that serotonin

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:38.820
 coming from hypothyroid digestive related problem,

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:44.860
 the excess serotonin becomes

00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:48.540
 an essential cause of the headache.

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:50.100
 - Very interesting.

00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.940
 So you're kind of a big fan

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.020
 of doing these carrot salads, right?

00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:55.540
 Almost for anybody.

00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:57.740
 Just good, degraded carrots, right?

00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:59.620
 - Yeah, for example,

00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:05.340
 a woman at a clinic for fertility

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:10.180
 accidentally found out that giving

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:14.700
 the infertile women an antibiotic,

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:18.580
 a lot of them said their headaches

00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:21.940
 were cured by taking the antibiotic.

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:25.140
 And they looked at their blood hormones

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:28.820
 and saw that where they had had previously

00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:31.740
 high cortisol and estrogen

00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:34.780
 and low progesterone in their blood,

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:39.660
 the antibiotic had reversed that pattern,

00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:41.540
 increased their progesterone,

00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:44.260
 lowered both their estrogen and cortisol.

00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:50.500
 And they figured out that the antibiotic

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:56.140
 had stopped a bacterial process

00:59:56.140 --> 01:00:02.180
 that was blocking the liver's detoxifying action.

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:11.620
 When your thyroid is low, for example,

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:16.620
 the liver excretes estrogen

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:20.420
 into the gut trying to get rid of it.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:25.060
 But a low thyroid person has sluggish digestion

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:28.700
 and that excreted estrogen is reabsorbed

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:31.540
 from the gut back into the liver

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:35.980
 and creates stress hormones

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.660
 and accumulated high estrogen

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.500
 blocking progesterone production.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:46.460
 And so the antibiotic was improving

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.660
 their intestinal health

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:51.580
 and therefore their hormonal health.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:56.580
 And I tested the idea of just eating a big carrot every day

01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:01.980
 and had women with this pattern

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.940
 of high stress hormones and estrogen

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:07.980
 and low progesterone.

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:12.500
 And within three days of a daily carrot salad,

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.340
 they had experienced the same hormonal change

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:20.460
 that taking an antibiotic did.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.060
 - Three days of a carrot salad.

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:25.380
 And you like to do, let's see if I recall,

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:28.260
 a little bit of, let's see,

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.340
 is it coconut oil and apple cider vinegar?

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:34.140
 - Yeah, that's-- - A little bit?

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:39.140
 - Any vinegar and basically any fairly saturated oil.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:44.180
 Olive oil tastes better, but coconut oil is,

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:48.260
 the trouble on the salad is it solidifies.

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.660
 - Yeah. - And so I like

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:53.020
 a little mixture of olive and coconut oil.

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:55.260
 - Do you think in general,

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:57.500
 consuming coconut oil for most people

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.180
 could be a good thing for us?

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.540
 Is it a good food?

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:05.660
 - Yeah, it's a good, safe food.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:08.180
 I found when I first experimented with it

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:12.420
 that my respiration rate increased.

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:15.220
 It activated my thyroid function

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:19.700
 to have a tablespoon added to my supper.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.540
 And doing that regularly,

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:25.940
 my weight stabilized 10 pounds lower

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:29.820
 because it was increasing my metabolic rate

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:31.460
 just with a tablespoon a day.

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.900
 - Oh yeah, we've heard about that

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:37.100
 and the thyroid and coconut oil.

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:38.980
 I think we've interviewed some people over the years

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:41.540
 that actually experienced that.

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:42.740
 That's curious.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:46.860
 Let's see, so many emails here.

01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:55.660
 This lady, what does Dr. Peat think of smoked oysters

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:59.860
 in a can, say in olive oil?

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:03.300
 Are they safe when it comes to dioxins,

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.340
 content and other heavy metals?

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:12.900
 - You have to balance how delicious and nutritious they are

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:18.220
 against the fact that things from the ocean

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:22.080
 are now generally more radioactive than ever.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:26.480
 But eventually it's going to be in all of our food.

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:32.340
 So I think having a can of them once a month,

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:36.260
 you could consider to be safe.

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:41.180
 But if you ate a can every day,

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:46.180
 then you could worry about the heavy metals and radiation.

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.580
 - Yeah, so I wonder what about shrimp,

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:54.260
 oysters and things like that from internal waters

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:55.900
 like the Gulf.

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:59.180
 I mean, they had their issues with the oil some years ago,

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:01.880
 but do you think that's a better choice in the ocean?

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:07.580
 - In terms of radiation, it is, but other pollutants.

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.340
 - Yeah, who knows what's down there, right?

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:12.220
 - Yeah, the Mississippi River is pouring out

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:16.180
 huge amounts of industrial pollution.

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.700
 - That's tough.

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:21.140
 Here's a lady, Dr. Peat, she says that she has

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:23.820
 type two diabetes and would like to control it

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:25.300
 without drugs.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.540
 Is there anything that I could do

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.700
 to begin my journey in this?

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:36.740
 - Yeah, checking your cortisol is one thing.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:43.220
 The metabolic syndrome is very similar

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:46.460
 to what they call type two diabetes.

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:51.460
 It's a stress pattern that goes with weight gain,

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:56.700
 inability to oxidize glucose properly.

01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:01.700
 So making sure that your thyroid hormone is good,

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.780
 your digestion is good,

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:08.020
 and definitely avoiding polyunsaturated fats,

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:13.020
 which are blockers of thyroid hormone secretion and action.

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:20.900
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, the old poopers, huh?

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:27.340
 Here's the lady, she's 70, and my hair's still brown,

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.660
 but it keeps falling out.

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:35.380
 And hair that easily pulls out at the root.

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:39.060
 And she wants to know what could be the cause of that.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:40.260
 - What keeps falling out?

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:43.380
 - Her hair keeps kinda coming out, yeah.

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:46.860
 - Usually low thyroid is behind that,

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:51.860
 but the thyroid is closely connected to the parathyroid.

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:55.080
 When you're low in thyroid,

01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:01.260
 you tend to lose both sodium and calcium.

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:08.220
 Stress goes up and you lose those minerals.

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:12.020
 And so you want to make sure that you're getting

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:16.780
 a high intake of calcium in your diet relative to phosphate,

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:22.220
 because that will lower the parathyroid hormone

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:27.220
 and lower the mobilization of calcium from your bones.

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:31.860
 And when you're protecting your bones,

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:34.900
 you're also protecting your hair follicles.

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:40.860
 The parathyroid hormone is very closely connected

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:45.260
 to the metabolism of the hair follicle.

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:50.260
 And parathyroid inhibits energy production in mitochondria.

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:55.900
 And when it does that in the hair follicle,

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:59.700
 the hair follicle just doesn't have enough energy

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:00.840
 to keep growing.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:07.060
 And vitamin D and calcium and thyroid hormone

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:12.260
 are the things that will energize all of your cells,

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:14.380
 including the hair follicle.

01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:15.460
 - Very interesting.

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.940
 Dr. Peat, stay right there, please.

01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:20.260
 We're going to do a quick little break here and continue.

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:23.360
 It'd be a great time for a little plug

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.340
 that just fits right in.

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:26.020
 We were going to do a spot,

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:30.380
 but we think that this is a wonderful form of calcium

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.440
 because it comes from oysters,

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.460
 kind of like if you go through

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:36.200
 the Max Planck Institute idea

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.780
 that you don't want to do any kind of thing in your body

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:40.900
 unless it's from a living source.

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.300
 And these oysters are actually living.

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.780
 They were before they busted them up.

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:47.500
 They're tears of pearls.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.620
 They're pearls.

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.020
 It's all made from pearls, this product.

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:52.260
 Nothing but pearls.

01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:53.860
 And it's got a lot of calcium in there.

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:55.580
 Not all of it, but a lot of it.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.940
 And we'll give you the dosage after you hear about it.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.980
 Previously with Dr. Rulon Chu

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:03.300
 about her product called Pearlseum.

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.980
 So let's talk about the teeth first.

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.420
 Explain to me what's going on

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.900
 because there's something magical

01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:11.300
 when you dip your little toothbrush in water.

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.980
 Why do they look so sparkly and just, I don't know,

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:17.900
 something very energetically about the look of them?

01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:20.300
 - Yeah, it's very, very magical.

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:23.620
 So like a group of scientists in France

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:27.700
 discovered that when you put the pearl next to the bones

01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:30.900
 or skins or other connective tissues,

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:33.380
 and they find it stimulates new growth

01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:36.220
 of the bones and skins and connective tissues,

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:40.900
 and also to make existing bones and the skins

01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.900
 more healthy and stronger.

01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:46.020
 So brush your teeth with the pearl,

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:50.340
 then your teeth will make your existing teeth stronger.

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:55.340
 And also it will fill up teeth with the Pearlseum

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.780
 and the pearl powder will stimulate the new bone growth

01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:02.100
 and also make the existing teeth very strong.

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:03.300
 - It's really a great product.

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.220
 You'll love it.

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.100
 Take it internally or on your teeth

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.500
 and you can click an order, see the ad right there.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.900
 Pearlseum, that nice green container,

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:14.420
 Pearlseum on oneradionetwork.com.

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:22.820
 We're talking with Brandon Amelani

01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:25.540
 about his great product, the Blue Shield.

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:28.700
 And the Blue Shield is, the main product is a cube

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:31.380
 and it doesn't block the EMFs as some people think,

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:32.620
 right, Brandon?

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:33.620
 - That's correct, it doesn't.

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:36.660
 It's really about the communication of the device

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.740
 and the body and what we figured out

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:41.420
 is how to communicate with the body and amp it up.

01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.660
 So it's affecting the cell voltage,

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:46.420
 it's affecting the intercellular communication.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:49.100
 And the most important part is that it's getting the body

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.500
 to stop fighting the EMF,

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.620
 which are repetitive signals in the environment.

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.940
 They're non-native, they're man-made

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:58.380
 and the body raises white blood cell counts

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:01.220
 and attacks it like it's a virus essentially.

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.860
 - Interesting, that's very different technology

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:05.300
 from most units around.

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:08.780
 - Oh yeah, absolutely, this uses multiple scalar outputs

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:11.020
 and it's really innovative, the scalar realm,

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.740
 because it's using crystal photonics or light

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:16.340
 to basically do this digital signaling

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:17.940
 that creates these longitudinal waves

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:19.540
 that move through time-space

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:21.780
 and affect the subatomic structures between atoms.

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:24.020
 So as it moves and passes through your body,

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.740
 it's literally affecting the mental, emotional, physical

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:29.220
 and spiritual components of what we're made up of.

01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:32.220
 - Well, as you can hear, this is interesting technology,

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:35.900
 very different, and working on the cells in the body.

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:37.980
 At the Blue Shield, it's on our website,

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:41.900
 front page, use promo code, OneRadio, little cube,

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.420
 take care of the whole house.

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:44.820
 They also have a little personal guy

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:46.900
 you can put in your pocket or purse.

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:51.380
 Blue Shield, promo code, OneRadio, oneradionetwork.com.

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:52.900
 - Yeah, that's right, and the little personal guy

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:55.460
 is kind of fun, it's just a little small guy

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.780
 and you can carry that around

01:10:56.780 --> 01:11:00.260
 and if you're getting blasted by cell phone towers

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.060
 and stuff when you go into the city,

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:05.780
 or if you're fortunate enough to live outside and all that,

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.460
 that's kind of a nice thing.

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.660
 Quick little plug here for Sithrival,

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:12.180
 has two great products, Colostrum,

01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:16.500
 Colostrum and the Digestive Bitter is on sale right now.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:20.380
 It's a great sale, might check it out.

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:22.260
 If you've not tried the Colostrum,

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:24.340
 we think that you'll really like this one.

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:25.380
 It's been around forever,

01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:28.820
 it's one of the flagship products of Daniel.

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:32.260
 And if you use Healthy Gut as the promo code,

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:35.900
 then they also have the Digestive Bitters on sale.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.700
 Healthy Gut, and that's the promo code

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:42.420
 for Sir Thrival Links, oneradionetwork.com.

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.780
 The sale going on right now.

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:49.420
 - Know the source, One Radio Network.

01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:51.660
 - And we are talking with Dr. Ray Peat,

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:53.420
 who's kind enough to come here once a month

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:57.500
 and talk to us and see what's going on.

01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:00.420
 Have you, were you exposed to the smoke and all that?

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:04.180
 Now you live up north, way up northwest, right?

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:06.580
 - Yeah, for a couple of weeks.

01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:08.380
 We didn't go outside.

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:14.580
 The sun looked like a maraschino cherry,

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.260
 the smoke was so thick.

01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:18.860
 - My goodness, my goodness.

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:22.500
 Has it pretty much, have they got these under control now?

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:25.620
 - Yeah, the rain came about a week ago

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.220
 and it seems to have put out the fires,

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:29.460
 and the air is clean.

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.780
 - This may be above your pay grade,

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:36.180
 but this idea that these forests can be managed

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:38.180
 by getting rid of the undergrowth,

01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:41.100
 President Trump was arguing for a long time ago,

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:43.260
 is that viable, do you think?

01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:47.180
 Is that one of the ways to keep these things from burning,

01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:49.740
 getting rid of this stuff?

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:54.740
 - That idea came in about 45 or 50 years ago,

01:12:55.740 --> 01:13:00.740
 and they said that the Indians used to manage the forests

01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:03.620
 that way, burning the undergrowth.

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:08.620
 But by the time, in these recent decades,

01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:13.660
 by the time they decided to try that autonomous regulation,

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:23.740
 the forests had been so devastated,

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:29.860
 they had dried out, and the let it burn philosophy

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:35.800
 was put in really as a ploy to get at the remaining

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.300
 old-growth forests.

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:46.260
 Supposedly, letting it burn would clean out the undergrowth

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:50.620
 the way it used to 1,000 years ago,

01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:54.860
 but the forests aren't the way they used to be,

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:59.500
 and when you let them burn, they go wild and destroy

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:03.620
 the old trees instead of burning the undergrowth.

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:07.020
 The stuff has accumulated to the point

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:10.340
 that the whole thing is destroyed.

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:15.340
 And when the government set aside these wilderness areas

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:21.340
 of untouched old-growth trees,

01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:24.260
 the lumber companies wanted access to them,

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:29.260
 so they passed the salvage laws that if there was a fire,

01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:37.060
 they could then go in and log even the undamaged trees

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:43.380
 in an area where a burn had caused some damage.

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:48.940
 So, functionally, it was a way for the lumber companies

01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:52.460
 to get at the set-aside old-growth forests.

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:57.460
 And the number of forest fires beginning

01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:03.260
 in the old-growth areas suddenly expanded

01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:08.580
 a great increase of fire beginning

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:14.260
 as soon as the salvage law was passed,

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:19.260
 strongly suggesting arson to get at the trees

01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:21.860
 by starting a fire.

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:25.200
 - Wow, man.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.260
 Interesting.

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:32.240
 Elizabeth says she's on YouTube watching.

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:36.060
 Ever since lockdowns, many more people

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:41.060
 are experiencing panic attacks and vertigo.

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:45.340
 Can Dr. Peate explain why this could be?

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:51.580
 - Yeah, my latest newsletter was sort of stimulated

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:57.880
 by that question of a rise in the,

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:03.800
 of the inefficient metabolism of glucose,

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:14.840
 producing lactic acid is associated with the panic attack.

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:21.400
 If you give intravenous lactic acid, for example,

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:28.040
 especially if a person is susceptible to the panic attacks,

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:31.880
 they will trigger the attack.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:38.200
 The healthier person doesn't necessarily

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.000
 experience a panic attack,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.720
 but it's the very powerful trigger.

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:49.720
 And anxiety increases as your thyroid function goes down

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.600
 and as your thyroid function goes down,

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.400
 your tendency to produce lactic acid

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:03.220
 instead of carbon dioxide increases.

01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:07.760
 Thyroid is needed to oxidize glucose

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:10.420
 all the way to carbon dioxide.

01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:15.420
 And the carbon dioxide suppresses the excitatory nerves

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:20.920
 and blocks the formation of free lactic acid.

01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:27.020
 So thyroid improves your metabolic efficiency

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:33.520
 and prevents these attacks of anxiety and hyperventilation.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:41.240
 If a person is at all susceptible to a panic attack,

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:46.320
 if you have them breathe, hyperventilate,

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.960
 breathe as fast as they can for a minute or two,

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:55.240
 that will usually trigger a tremendous increase

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:58.360
 in lactic acid and panic attack

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:02.560
 simply because the hyperventilating

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:06.640
 makes you lose your carbon dioxide.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.320
 And in the loss of the carbon dioxide,

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:14.280
 you produce too much lactic acid.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:19.280
 And the excitatory processes of glutamatergic

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:25.240
 stimulation, basic excitatory process in the brain

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:31.640
 takes over in the absence of carbon dioxide.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.280
 - So that idea when we breathe less or do more of the Buteyko

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.180
 so we're not getting rid of the carbon dioxide,

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:45.120
 that helps when we feel anxious.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:49.480
 - Yeah, carbon dioxide has a sedative

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:51.280
 or even anesthetic effect

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:53.540
 when you get very large amounts of it.

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:58.400
 - Matt is watching the show on YouTube.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.220
 Hi, Matt.

01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:03.460
 Does high-dose dosing bone broth have benefits

01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:06.120
 like above 50 ounces a day?

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:13.920
 - When people talk about bone broth,

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:18.920
 sometimes they are thinking of long,

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:23.920
 like thigh bones and shin bones of a beef or lamb.

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:30.080
 And those are full of marrow, which is full of iron.

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:37.560
 And if you boil a bone containing marrow for a long time,

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:44.420
 the iron attacks the fats and creates a bad taste

01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:47.220
 and toxins.

01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:52.020
 So I don't think it's a good idea at all

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:55.100
 to make soup from the long bones.

01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:59.020
 But the knobby ends of the bones,

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:04.020
 where the cartilage at the surface of the joint

01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:08.500
 and the ligaments that hold the joints together

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:12.580
 and the tendons where the muscles are attached,

01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:18.500
 those are the good material for making stock.

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:27.340
 The proper bone broth should be from the knobby cartilage

01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:34.260
 and collagen-rich tissues.

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:39.260
 And the broth, when you cool it, should be rubbery.

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:42.700
 You should be able to bounce your broth when it's cold.

01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:43.900
 - Yeah, very good.

01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:48.380
 So this idea that, it's curious that iron

01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:50.040
 is in these long bones.

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.620
 I don't know if places you buy the bones,

01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:55.180
 they may chop up those bones and put them in there.

01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:57.820
 So I guess you gotta be careful of what you're doing.

01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.780
 So just speaking of iron in general,

01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:02.220
 there are people that advocate us giving blood

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:06.820
 every two or three times a year to lower our iron levels.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:09.940
 Do you think that's valuable, interesting?

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:13.100
 - Yeah, the studies that have been done

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:15.820
 of regular blood donors,

01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:20.820
 they are much healthier than the average population.

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:23.020
 - Lowering the iron level?

01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:25.400
 - I think that's a big part of it,

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:29.700
 but they're also getting rid of some of the

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:31.760
 stress-induced exosomes.

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:36.420
 There have been some very good studies in which

01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:41.420
 you separate the clear part of the blood plasma,

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:46.820
 and you're concentrating the platelets,

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:49.220
 and along with the platelets,

01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:55.580
 the usually invisible exosome fraction.

01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:58.260
 You need an electron microscope to see them,

01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:03.260
 but when you take the plasma from an old animal

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:08.180
 and put it in a young animal, it induces aging.

01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:10.540
 And if you reverse the process,

01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:15.540
 put young plasma into an old animal, you delay aging.

01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:21.900
 So these exosome fractions also contain stress signals

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:28.220
 and aging degenerative signals.

01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:30.740
 Or reparative, restorative signals,

01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:34.220
 depending on the source, the state of the animal

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:36.260
 donating the material.

01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:41.820
 So if you're experiencing stress and donating blood,

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:45.240
 you're getting rid of some of these signals

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.940
 of stress and aging.

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:50.300
 - Do we give it to the people they give the blood to?

01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:53.540
 - Yeah, you're giving them your age and stress.

01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:56.920
 - All right, well, it's always something.

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.660
 John writes in on YouTube,

01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:01.140
 "You have mentioned that pregnenolone

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:02.900
 is found in organ meats.

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:05.460
 How much pregnenolone in milligrams

01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:09.140
 would be like for a typical serving of organ meat

01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:14.140
 that humans consume as foods such as beef liver or the like?"

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:15.260
 Do we know?

01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:21.780
 - Adrenal glands and gonads are the only sources

01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:27.120
 that have a medically important quantity of it.

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:33.640
 Every cell has some, but the adrenals are very rich in it,

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:36.840
 several milligrams per gland.

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:43.600
 So that's been the basis for adrenal extract

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.160
 or just recommending eating adrenal glands,

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:53.820
 or gonads because of the precursor steroid,

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:58.820
 which is there for making the potentially harmful

01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:01.920
 cortisol and estrogen.

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:08.100
 The precursor material is beneficial,

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:16.340
 but the end hormone can be disruptive.

01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:17.340
 - Very interesting.

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:22.640
 Any chance Dr. Peat could explain how many times a week

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:28.840
 and for how long could we use progesterone

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:31.920
 for male pattern hair loss?

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:38.560
 - Oh, I've known people who stopped and reversed it

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:44.280
 by daily application of oily progesterone to the scalp.

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:50.040
 It's messy and unpleasant,

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:55.040
 but it can change the course of the hair loss,

01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:02.840
 especially if you back it up with a high calcium diet

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:05.720
 and thyroid as needed.

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:11.760
 But a lot of men are now supplementing five to 10 milligrams

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.720
 when they're in middle age and they find that

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:25.720
 by limiting their pituitary stress signals,

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:31.340
 they're lowering their body estrogen

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:36.340
 and that's having a rejuvenating effect on their tissue.

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:41.280
 They even feel like they're having more testosterone

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.320
 because they aren't wasting it, turning it to estrogen.

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:45.160
 - Interesting.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.320
 So the one you like is that, what is it called,

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.840
 Progest-E or no?

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.120
 - Yeah, the Kenogen Progest-E Complex.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.180
 - Yeah, Complex.

01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:56.900
 Now I got some of that, but they were talking about drops,

01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:59.320
 but if you put it in the fridge,

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.280
 you can't even get the stuff out.

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.440
 And then I kept it on the counter.

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.560
 You can't really do a drop, it just kind of comes out

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:06.680
 and pop.

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.840
 So I mean, I guess you just do a little bit of it

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.160
 and don't worry.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:13.440
 - Yeah, you just don't want to let it stand in the sunlight

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:17.360
 because sunlight degrades the vitamin E,

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:20.960
 but the progesterone is safe at room temperature

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:21.800
 indefinitely.

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.360
 - Okay, but it's not real critical

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.020
 exactly how much you get in there?

01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:31.400
 - No, if you took half a teaspoon at one dose,

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.560
 it might make you drunk for a while.

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:36.480
 (laughing)

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:38.280
 - We're pretty drunk anyway, Doc.

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:42.600
 Another emailer off on YouTube wants to know,

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:45.640
 well, what would one do after finding a lump

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.640
 on one of my testicles?

01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:48.480
 Not good.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:57.120
 - If it's in the testicle,

01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.120
 that definitely is evidence that you should have examined

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:08.480
 a possible testicular cancer,

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:12.600
 but it should include an examination

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.360
 of your pituitary hormones.

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:15.200
 - Okay.

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:20.200
 - Because if you, for example, remove one testicle,

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:24.480
 your pituitary becomes overactive

01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:27.960
 and that will increase the risk of cancer developing

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.760
 by overstimulating it.

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:34.180
 The same with adrenal glands or the thyroid.

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:40.360
 Increased pituitary activity is a major driver

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:44.040
 of tissue stress and cancerization.

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:50.120
 So making sure that your pituitary is not overactive

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:52.480
 is something that should go along

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:55.440
 with examining whether it's cancerous.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.280
 - Good job.

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:58.000
 Richard is in Denmark.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.960
 Ever been to Denmark, Dr. Peat?

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.720
 - Yes, went through it.

01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:02.960
 - Yeah, Denmark.

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:08.420
 And he says, could you play us back Peat what to do with pain related to... I'm gonna try

01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:19.580
 this one, Gliospargenoneuralgia, am I saying that, Glossopharyngealneuralgia, and it seems

01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:25.880
 to get worse when lying down. What is that, glossophyllneuralgia?

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:27.080
 What was the first...

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:34.520
 G-L-O-S-S-O-P-H-A-R-Y-N-G-E-A-L, like the pharynx.

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.840
 That would be the throat.

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.480
 The throat, right, yeah.

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:50.640
 It could be related to the reflux problem. When you lie down, your sympathetic nervous

01:28:50.640 --> 01:29:00.000
 system decreases and your parasympathetic activity increases, and that affects your

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:09.640
 swallowing and intestinal peristalsis. And especially if you're hypothyroid, you can

01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:19.120
 have exaggerated parasympathetic action, and that can lead to even reverse peristalsis

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:29.440
 and spasms of the various sphincters of the esophagus, and I assume it would be connected

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:34.880
 to this throat area's pain and spasms.

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:43.680
 Fascinating. Naomi's on YouTube watching. Hi Naomi. What does high albumin in a blood

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:47.080
 test mean? High albumin.

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:57.200
 Usually, it's a sign of dehydration. You should check everything else. For example, the red

01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:08.720
 blood cell count is usually increased. If you're exercising, for example, if you haven't

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:16.640
 had anything to drink for a long time and walked for half an hour in warm weather before

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:25.920
 having the blood drawn, your blood would be a little drier, and that would make your red

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:36.000
 cell count and your albumin increase. But ordinarily, it's good to have albumin around

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:52.680
 4.5 to 5. What's dangerous is when it gets below 4 or 40, however the scale is.

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:58.640
 Gotcha. Patrick Timpone along with Dr. Ray Peat. Doc, we'd like to stick around just

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:02.600
 a few more minutes if you don't mind. We got started late, and do a couple of more

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:09.200
 emails. People have some good questions. I just want to give a quick plug here. I won't

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:17.520
 take a long time for this hydrogen machine. I went to a body worker that I've been going

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:22.280
 to for several years. Very good. He knows my body, and he remembers. He said, "Well,

01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:27.400
 the last time this wasn't here, I mean, this guy's really on it." I went last week, and

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:31.440
 I hadn't been able to go for about six months because they had all kinds of weird things

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:36.280
 going on with the corona thing, and I didn't want to wear a mask and all that. So it was

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:45.560
 like six months. So I went to him last week, a 90-minute session. And he, two or three

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:53.040
 different times during the session, he said, "I've never felt your body so hydrated as

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:57.280
 you are today." I've known this guy for two or three years. "Never," he said.

01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:02.880
 "What are you doing?" So the only thing I know that I'm doing very differently is I'm

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:09.760
 drinking the hydrogen-rich water from this machine, the Aquacure machine, and also breathing

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:16.800
 the gas. George says that this helps with hydration, dehydration, dehydrogen. There's

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:23.720
 science that shows that as well. You can go to molecularhydrogeninstitute.com and look

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:30.480
 at all the huge amount of peer-reviewed studies that talk about hydrogen. And this is Brown's

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:38.560
 gas. So this may help you with hydrating as well. He said it about three times. I mean,

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:44.720
 he just couldn't believe it. He said, "My whole body was never seen this hydrated, well

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:50.160
 hydrated." Pretty cool. Drinking the water and breathing the gas. It's anecdotal, but

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:55.800
 could be something there for you that's interesting. So that's hydrogen. You can click an order.

01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:14.160
 We're with Dr. Ray Peat. This may be above your or not in your bailiwick doc, but we'll

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:21.960
 give it a shot. I have a nine-year-old dog that keeps getting these little lipomas, little

01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:26.480
 fatty deposits. Not very big, but there's a few on her body. The vet says there's nothing

01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:31.960
 to worry about. Do you have an opinion about these? Do you know about what could be lipomas

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:34.680
 in animals and what could be causing them?

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:45.960
 I think it's the same as in humans, a slight hormone imbalance. Parathyroid hormone and

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:59.000
 thyroid hormone are the main things behind the problem of collecting fat in irritated

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:08.920
 areas especially. So checking the amount of calcium in the diet relative to phosphate,

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:18.760
 it should be a fairly high amount of calcium, not too much phosphate. With the dog, that

01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:24.240
 means including maybe some cottage cheese or milk in the diet.

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:29.920
 We'll give them more calcium. Most people that are really into their dogs, they're on

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:37.360
 a more meat-based diet because they're carnivores, but that has a lot of phosphate, right?

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:47.200
 Yeah. Carnivores always would eat some of the small bones. Some people eating chickens,

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:57.600
 for example, like to eat the ribs and other small bones. If you have good teeth, and carnivores

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:03.040
 traditionally have eaten a lot of the bones.

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:10.120
 So this person could try a personal product, which is pearls or bones, more bones, and

01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:15.140
 also cottage cheese or cream or something.

01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:17.520
 Calcium isn't such a good source of calcium.

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:18.880
 Milk is.

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:28.480
 Yeah. Oyster shells and egg shells are extremely good sources of extra calcium, but people

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:31.360
 fear giving their dogs bones.

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:34.960
 As long as they're raw, that's fine, right?

01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:41.320
 Yeah. A dog with good teeth can crunch the bones up and get their calcium from bones.

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:48.080
 Sure. So the calcium phosphorus could be an antagonist to the thyroid, which could straighten

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.280
 out with more calcium, possibly?

01:35:51.280 --> 01:36:01.960
 Yeah. Having an excess of calcium and a slight excess even of sodium goes together with guaranteeing

01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:12.200
 that your cell energy is going to be supported and close to a maximum. It's a deficiency

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:21.160
 of both sodium and calcium that leads to a rise in stress hormones and parathyroid hormone

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:23.560
 and suppression of the thyroid.

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:27.960
 And that could induce this person's dog to form these little lumps.

01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:37.480
 Yeah. Too much phosphate in the diet has an irritating effect that I think contributes

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:48.800
 to little tumor-like developments that can be fatty. Fibrous and fatty tumors develop

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:53.560
 irritants.

01:36:53.560 --> 01:37:01.680
 So in nature, in wolves and such, then that would balance out by eating more bones, right?

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:14.360
 Yeah. Bones are good. If you don't specialize in aged animals, some of the bone meal supplements

01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:23.040
 decades ago were made from aged animals that were at the end of their lifespan, so their

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:35.880
 bones were loaded up on heavy metals, very high in lead and other toxic heavy metals.

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:41.800
 So if they're made from the regular meat animals, then the bones are safe.

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:49.920
 Jeremy said, "I began taking 60 grains of thyroid, the T3 and the T4. My body temperature

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:55.440
 was low." I'm paraphrasing, it's kind of long. And it was at 97, like 97.5, and it

01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:57.160
 just kind of stays there.

01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:04.720
 And then I increased, as Dr. Peat recommended, maybe after a week or two, I went to 120 grains

01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:16.080
 and my pulse rate increased from 60 to 75. But my body temperature didn't move at all.

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:20.200
 "Am I on the right track? Should I keep going, do you think, with what I'm doing?" writes

01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:21.200
 Jeremy.

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:28.400
 It depends on what kind of thyroid it is. You want to make sure it's, if it's a glandular

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:41.760
 product, you might try a different product because every source, they are no longer standardizing

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:51.240
 the process of manufacturing it. And some of them are apparently not as well selected

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:58.560
 purified, glandular tissues, so the potency can vary.

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:07.520
 Brody Barnes sometimes would prescribe as much as five grains or 300 milligrams.

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.120
 That's a lot.

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:16.600
 The standard tablets are rated from as small as a fourth of a grain, 15 milligrams, up

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:28.560
 to the 300 milligram five-grain tablets. And the veterinarians said that cocker spaniels

01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:35.160
 typically needed one of the five-grain tablets because they have such a tendency to hypothyroidism.

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:46.360
 But I've only seen a few people, maybe five or 10% of the people on a thyroid supplement

01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:49.600
 who needed as much as five grains a day.

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:56.280
 So are there actually products out there that we know for thyroid people that are using

01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:02.240
 the, what did you say, the glandular? Are there products that they can get through their doctor?

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:14.320
 Yeah, the Armour product has been passed through several different companies and its quality

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:22.920
 has changed over the last 30 years. But I think they're now making a moderately well-standardized

01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:35.360
 product. But I still use Sinoplus as a reliable dose-consistent product.

01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:41.920
 And the Sinoplus from Mexico, that gets you the T3 and the T4, right?

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:42.920
 Mm-hmm.

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:48.920
 And you start the same way. Did you do the same grams gross?

01:40:48.920 --> 01:41:05.400
 Yeah, the tablet contains 120 micrograms of T4 and 30 micrograms of T3. In the old conversion,

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:12.200
 that would be two and a half grains, roughly equivalent.

01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:18.200
 And do you remember, recall the name of the place that you gave us in Mexico that might

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:20.200
 be the place to get this Sinoplus?

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:23.200
 Yeah, Farmacias Del Nino.

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:25.200
 Del Nino, right.

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:26.200
 Dot-mex.

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:27.200
 Dot-mex.

01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.200
 Dot-mex.

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:37.640
 M-X, yeah. Farmacia Del Nino dot M-X. And pretty reliable. So the Sinoplus then gives

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:43.200
 you the T3 and the T4 in a glandular, right?

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:52.200
 No, it's based on the glandular, but it's a synthetic equivalent. The Armour Company

01:41:52.200 --> 01:42:01.200
 created the first balanced synthetic, and they called it Thyrolar. And other companies,

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:10.200
 especially the one that makes Sinoplus, simply imitated one of the Thyrolar tablets, but

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:16.200
 now they only have the one potency. So you generally want to start with a fourth of a

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:20.200
 tablet because it's a fairly high potency tablet.

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:25.200
 So you don't have a problem then with the Sinoplus from Mexico, even though it's

01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:27.200
 synthetic, it works?

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:33.200
 Yeah, it's based on the content of the original Armour product.

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:36.200
 So the body doesn't kind of know the difference?

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:39.200
 No, they're chemically the same.

01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:48.200
 Really? Interesting. Why does Dr. Peat think that there's so many alternative health

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:55.200
 experts that are so strongly advocating fish oil and Omega-3 supplementation? That's

01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:58.200
 an interesting question. There's a lot of them, right, out there.

01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:01.200
 Oh yeah, it's all advertising based.

01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.200
 Really?

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:16.200
 It used to be the seed oils that were recommended by alternative health people and nutritionists.

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:26.200
 Starting in the 1950s, they had their cotton seed oil and safflower seed oil and soy oil.

01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:37.200
 The market for paints, varnishes and plastics made from the seed oils disappeared when petroleum

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:46.200
 chemists learned how to make them very cheaply from petroleum. So the industry producing

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:57.200
 those oils needed a new market and so they decided to call them essential fatty acids.

01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:04.200
 If they're essential, then the reasoning was more of them must be good and so they sold

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:11.200
 them on the basis that they were found to lower blood cholesterol. What they were doing

01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:18.200
 was injuring the tissues causing cholesterol to build up in your liver and other tissues

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:26.200
 so the blood level of cholesterol went down. So the essential fatty acids for about 30

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:37.200
 years were the alternative and standard medical remedy for circulatory disease, even though

01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:45.200
 scientifically these polyunsaturated fats are very closely connected to inflammation

01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:52.200
 of the arteries and degeneration of the tissues and suppression of thyroid function.

01:44:52.200 --> 01:45:01.200
 A big study by the Veterans Administration found that not only did these essential fatty

01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:11.200
 acids fail to solve heart disease mortality, they increased it, but at the same time they

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:23.200
 caused several fold increase in cancer mortality. That was very bad for the health promoting

01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:31.200
 advertising industry and so they decided if the essential fatty acids are toxic, we have

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:41.200
 to come up with something else. Oh yeah, it's the N-3 essential fatty acids that are really

01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:51.200
 essential and so they shifted over to a different kind of polyunsaturated fat.

01:45:51.200 --> 01:46:01.200
 The science, mink breeders for example, knew for decades that if they fed them fish, they

01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:11.200
 died of yellow fat disease and other degenerative conditions. So the toxicity of the fish oil

01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:20.200
 was known for just about as long as the toxicity of the soy oil category. But it takes about

01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:33.200
 50 years for science to overcome advertising and we're just now reaching the point where

01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:37.200
 people are starting to question the safety of the fish oils.

01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:43.200
 But you know the proponents of it, they argue that well, they used to use cod liver oil

01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:49.200
 a couple hundred years ago and it was fine and it helped people. Is there any evidence

01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:51.200
 to that, cod liver oil being beneficial?

01:46:51.200 --> 01:47:04.200
 Oh sure, vitamin D and A in the liver oil, those are so protective that in spite of the

01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:11.200
 fairly large amount of polyunsaturated fats that went along with it, making sure that

01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:21.200
 your vitamin D and A are adequate, those are so important for the health that you can somewhat

01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:26.200
 neglect the toxic fish oils that are associated with them.

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:30.200
 I see, but that's in a cod liver, right, a good cod liver oil, not just what they call

01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:32.200
 fish oil, difference, right?

01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:42.200
 Yeah, the liver is very high in the protective vitamins and not so high in the PUFA as in

01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:43.200
 plain fish oil.

01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:49.200
 So possibly these cod liver oil from a good source could be used for healing if somebody

01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:57.200
 is low on A or something and not necessarily get you yellow fat disease 30 years later?

01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:09.200
 Probably not, a tablespoon per day wouldn't reach the very acute kind of degenerative

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:14.200
 processes that eating fatty fish every day can do.

01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:20.200
 Yeah, is there a big difference, before we go, of the kinds of fish we get at the fish

01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:27.200
 counter, you know, you have so many different choices, you know, salmon, cod, oysters, any

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:31.200
 kind of ideas there from you as far as our best choices?

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:41.200
 Yeah, you want to avoid the very big fish that are old because over years of eating

01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:49.200
 little fish, they accumulate more and more toxic heavy metals, so tuna and orange ruffey

01:48:49.200 --> 01:49:00.200
 for example are usually fairly old and big, and so moderate sized fish like sole and cod,

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:08.200
 they are lower in the heavy metals and they also are relatively low in polyunsaturated

01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:18.200
 fats, so I avoid eating very often salmon or herring or the fatty fish.

01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:23.200
 Do you think fish with all the challenges in the water, potential mercury, Dr. Peat,

01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:25.200
 are worth eating?

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:29.200
 They help us to stay healthy, do you think?

01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:36.200
 Some kind of seafood about once a week will provide selenium, that's one of the very

01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:44.200
 important things that you always get from seafood, so it could be shrimp or oysters

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:53.200
 or cod or sole or any kind of marine food will give you a little bit of copper and other

01:49:53.200 --> 01:50:02.200
 trace minerals and iodine along with the essential selenium which can be deficient in land grown

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:03.200
 food.

01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:08.200
 Yeah, well Dr. Peat, thanks for sticking around a little bit longer today, we had a lot of,

01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:10.200
 still never get through all of them but we do what we can.

01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:17.200
 We appreciate your time, you stay well up there and visit Dr. Peat at raypeat.com, you

01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:23.200
 can try his newsletter, it's raypeat's plural newsletter at gmail.com, comes out every couple

01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:29.200
 of months for a few bucks and support him and stuff and Dr. Peat, thanks a lot, we appreciate

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:33.200
 your work and let us know if there's anything we can do to help you.

01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:34.200
 Okay, thank you.

01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:35.200
 Thank you, sir.

01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:36.200
 Bye-bye.

01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:37.200
 Bye.

01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:41.200
 This is Patrick Timpone, it's OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.200
 So, so much fun talking to him.

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:48.200
 Boy, it gets a little geeky and it's great, you actually understand some, you know, it's

01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:49.200
 like, "Whoa!"

01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:53.200
 You connect all the dots but it's really, really fun to have him on.

01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:55.200
 We do the best we can with the questions.

01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:57.200
 I hope we're able to get to yours.

01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:02.200
 I'm going to go through and get all the ones that we still have in the hopper.

01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:08.200
 So, for the next, for his November show, we're going to start with some of the older ones.

01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:10.200
 Sorry if we can't get to them all.

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:15.200
 Sometimes it's just tough to kind of figure it out, you know, get them all in but we do

01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:17.200
 what we can.

01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:25.200
 Okay, we are live here Monday and tomorrow we're going to talk with Gerald Pollard and

01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:31.200
 also, who else are we talking to tomorrow?

01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:35.200
 Oh, a fellow about the deep state, Whitehead, Mr. Whitehead.

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:37.200
 And we're going to do a couple of other things this week too.

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:42.200
 So, stay tuned, stay in touch with us, let us know if we can help.

01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:47.200
 Two ways to know these kind of great interviews that are going to be coming your way on the

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.200
 front page of One Radio Network.

01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:55.200
 One is sign up for a newsletter right at the top of the front page and a couple times a

01:51:55.200 --> 01:52:01.200
 week you'll just get a little email in your inbox and tell you who we're going to have on.

01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:06.200
 Also, you know, keep in touch with us on Facebook because we stream these shows right there

01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:09.200
 as well.

01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:15.200
 I know there's a way to notify you when we put on a stream but I haven't quite figured

01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:16.200
 that out.

01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:19.200
 If anybody knows how to do that, let me know.

01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:25.200
 And then on Ubi2bi, if you go to our YouTube channel and you can get there by clicking

01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:32.200
 on YouTube on the top right of One Radio Network or just put in YouTube Patrick Timpone, click

01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:36.200
 on the subscribe button and then there's a little bell right to the right of the subscribe

01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:41.200
 button, click on that baby and every time we do a stream like this one, whether it's

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:47.200
 recorded or live, they call it live stream, either way you'll get a notification saying,

01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:50.200
 "Hey, we got a new one that's put up there."

01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:51.200
 So that's a nice way to do that.

01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:57.200
 Do the little bell thing on the right, otherwise the notification thing doesn't work.

01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.200
 Okay, thank you for your ongoing support.

01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:06.200
 I appreciate you trusting some of these products that we talk about and if I have, if there's

01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:11.200
 any way I can help you with these or anything else, my email, I don't go far from the email

01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:17.200
 unfortunately, but unfortunately it's patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:21.200
 Patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:24.200
 Okay kids, I love you all very much.

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:27.200
 May the blessings be and we'll see you real soon.

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:29.200
 Stay tuned, stay in touch.

01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:33.200
 We are listener supported.

01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:35.200
 One Radio Network.

01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:37.260
 you

01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:39.920
 (vibrant music)
