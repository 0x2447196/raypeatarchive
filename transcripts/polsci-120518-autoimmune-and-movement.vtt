00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 The following interview with Ray Peat was recorded on May 18, 2012.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 If you'd like more information about Dr. Raymond Peat, you can go to his website,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 RayPeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T dot com,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 where there's many interesting articles for free available for your enjoyment.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Also, if you're interested in hearing this show again,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 many politics and science shows are posted at RadioNumeral4All.net,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 RadioNumber4All.net, and when you get there, search for "politics and science."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Hello and welcome to "Politics and Science." I'm John Barkhausen, your host,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 and today we're going to talk about some autoimmune diseases and some movement disorder dysfunctions.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 I'm intrigued by them not only because I have friends that are suffering from these,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 but also because the medical world offers so little knowledge about the diseases

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 and so little hope or practical knowledge in terms of treatment for what to do to help people.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 I'm very happy that Dr. Raymond Peat is here to join me again today.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Dr. Peat has a Ph.D. in biology from the University of Oregon

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 and extensive knowledge of science history.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 There are many theories as to the causes of the diseases,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 and one common factor that is present in all of them and that most people agree on is inflammation.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Ray, I just want to start off by asking you why is so little understood about these diseases?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Well, I think there's a lot more known than the public is aware of.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 The medical journals aren't a good place to look

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 if you're just wanting to find out how much is known,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 but if you read widely in not only medical journals but general science journals,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 you see that people have discovered really interesting things about all of them

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 and that there are patterns that show up across the various diseases

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 that I think really things could be put into practice more than they are.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 And there are people demonstrating improvement in the degenerative diseases

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 with very simple antioxidant supplements and creatine supplements and such

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 that you just don't hear about in the New York Times stories about advances in health.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 I think part of it is that when a generic substance looks like it might prevent

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 or cure one of these horrible conditions, the drug industry isn't interested,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 so there's no advertising money to be made by running publicity about it.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 So nobody pursues it.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Ray, can you explain where you're finding out this knowledge of hopeful techniques

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 to combat these diseases?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 A lot of it you can find right in PubMed and Google.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 A lot of it in more obscure journals, but there's enough to keep a person busy for years

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 just putting pieces together like making a meaningful puzzle out of scraps

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 from the various lines of thinking.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Like if you follow one disease over 20 or 30 years, like Alzheimer's,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 there are a number of styles focusing on the cholinergic nerve death

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 or the accumulating fibrils, amyloid and such,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 and explaining that as a toxin that causes the disease.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 And the various different diseases, each one goes through its styles

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 and what they think is interesting, but the pressure on funding the research and such

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 pushes generally towards a genetic explanation that makes a simple drug solution conceivable,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 like something to stop that one genetic defect from taking its effect.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 So when you say styles, are you talking about there's certain fads in research

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 that are prevalent at certain times?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Yeah, definitely fads, but the basic big fad that has lasted for 100 years

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 is the genetic explanation.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Like in Huntington's disease, it's a certain repeat that causes a series of glutamine amino acids

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 in the protein to increase, and that creates a protein that shows up as if it's doing damage.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 And so the framework idea is that the gene expresses itself in a protein

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 and the protein causes the symptoms of the disease,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 and so it's the idea that the gene is causing the disease.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 But there are several ways of approaching that.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 One is that something is causing this repeat to be formed in the gene itself.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 For example, they've noticed that generations,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 even though typically Huntington's is thought to set in at the age of 40 or so,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 they've noticed that the children of those people develop about eight years earlier,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 and each generation anticipates and starts the condition earlier.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 So there's something causing that repeat in the protein to increase each generation,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 and that is something that's slow to sink into the genetic causality that things are happening right now,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 each generation creating a tendency to mutate in a certain direction.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 There were many genetic theories that said that mutations do have a directionality,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 and they used to explain the growth of corn antlers on elks and swans getting bigger and bigger

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 because of some tendency in the organism to go in a certain direction.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Orthogenesis, they called it, but that was sort of vaguely anti-Darwinian

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 and inclined towards Lamarckism, and so it dropped out.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 But the idea of a defect in the gene that causes it to get worse and worse quickly with each generation

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 is more acceptable because in immunology, that was a solution to how antibodies can adapt so quickly

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 to any conceivable infection or antigen.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 They said they have to adapt by mutating so fast that they can evolve in just a few days

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 to match whatever antigen they're exposed to.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 So this idea of almost directed mutation got put into genetics by way of immunology,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 and there are the trends in a few places.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 John Cairns and Ted Steele are the people known to be working on the idea of directed mutations

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 in a constructive way, not just destructive.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Yeah, I'm awfully confused by this because I think of geneticists as saying, in the past at least,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 that genes were a permanent thing that were passed down from generation to generation

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 and could not be changed easily.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 Yeah, they have been open to the idea, but they're still not seeing it as anything deliberate

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 or constructive, just a way the defect can develop.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 It's a way to save the genetic causality rather than seeing that the same thing causing the symptoms

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 of the disease might also be causing the genes to change in the same direction.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 That's what they don't want to see is a link between the way the gene changes and the function of the protein

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 in the life of the individual organism.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 That's where it implies Lamarckism.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 You mean that the organism is directing the gene mutation?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Yeah, or that something is causing the organism on the cellular, not genetic level, to change

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 at the same time that the gene that regulates that cellular function is changing in the same direction.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 They shouldn't be coordinated that way so that the function and the gene change simultaneously

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 or even with the information going from the function into the gene and then back out.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Because that would mean that the organism is a propulsive being on the evolutionary level.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 That's the whole point ever since the anti-Darwinians in the 19th century, Weissmann in particular,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 they hated the idea that things could be changing meaningfully or purposefully

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 and wanted to say that there is no real change and genes were the way of proving that you might get a different mixture of traits

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 but the traits are eternal and the gene is what causes that.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 One of the people questioning this, James Shapiro, was working along in ordinary bacterial genetics

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 and he noticed that individuals exposed to an antibiotic could become resistant to it

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 and that they could pass that information on very intentionally to their neighbors

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 and even across varieties of one bacteria to another and spread it through whole systems

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 and that got him thinking about this idea of purposive change

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 and he's proposed that the organism does genetic engineering along the lines of what Barbara McClintock was talking about

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 but he says this is the general way genetics works in the organism, that the organism is its own genetic engineer doing changes for its own benefit.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Yeah, I can believe it because I was looking today at a physiology book trying to understand the nervous system

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 because a lot of the diseases we started off talking about are diseases of the nervous system

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 and it's pretty phenomenal if you open up an encyclopedia and look at how the nervous system is laid out.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 It's an awe-inspiring system and the idea that some scientists and philosophers think that that happened by random evolutionary trial and error

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 seems impossible to my mind.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 Yeah, the establishment genetics biology system including most of medicine are attacking James Shapiro

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 with his application of the Barbara McClintock way of thinking.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 And what was your point?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 The complexity and organization of it is.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 Randomness is such a deep part of their way of thinking that they are accusing Shapiro of being a creationist

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 and he says well the creationists sometimes speak very reasonably

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 and sometimes the so-called neo-Darwinians don't speak so scientifically and reasonably

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 and so he is attacking the science invoking creations because sometimes their arguments are positive.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Yeah, I mean I don't personally buy into the father figure in the sky looking down on us all.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 No, but he's saying that the organism itself is creating.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 That life has intelligence you've said before and that to me has the ring of truth to it

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 because as you look around the world and see basically as you say the world organizing itself

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 it's a good example of the intelligence all around us.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 And one of the things that sort of interested me that Carl Lindgren said in his book Cold War in Biology

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 was that in order to practice science back in the 40s and 50s in the United States

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 it was very helpful to profess some kind of belief in a god in order to keep your job.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 He said that professors were afraid to say they were an atheist or agnostic.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Yeah, all of my professors were churchgoers which used to be in the 19th century.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 They tended to be agnostics, biologists specifically.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 But it really did get a religious boost in the 1940s with the anti,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 they considered it anti-materialist but what it was was a different kind of materialism,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 randomness based materialism rather than the idea that material is part of the purpose of intelligent life process.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 Bringing this back to our topic today and talking about the inflammation that appears to be present

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 in all of these diseases we're talking about whether we're talking about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 which is ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease or multiple sclerosis which you've written about quite a bit

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 or rheumatoid arthritis, all these diseases which they don't really have any known cause or cure for

00:16:50.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 involve inflammation and maybe you could outline for us how science has perceived inflammation over the years.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 In the middle of the 20th century there was a heavy concentration on inflammation as a reaction to infection

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 to the extent that about 40 years ago, 35 years ago when I mentioned to a recent graduate something about

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 sterile inflammation she wouldn't let me continue and said there's no such thing as sterile inflammation.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 But in 1900 and before people were demonstrating that you could extract something from infectious organisms

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 that would create inflammation even if it was sterile and then with radiation experiments

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 they found that radiation created inflammation or trauma, completely sterile burns,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 shutting off the blood supply creates inflammation and I think the only way to approach inflammation

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 is to think of it as a gap that shouldn't exist between the demands made on the cells or the tissue

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 and the resources to meet those demands.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 If you traumatize or over stimulate a tissue or if you don't provide enough sugar and oxygen and carbon dioxide

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 to meet that stimulation, to hold the stimulation under control, then things go wrong

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 and the tissue becomes edematous and chain reactions happen that can kill the tissue

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 or if the organism can manage to recruit enough systems to provide sugar for example

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 and to stop the excitation then it can heal.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 A little inflammation rouses the organism to cause regeneration

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 otherwise it can lead to fibrosis and atrophy.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 So let's use an example of one of these diseases like multiple sclerosis.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 The myelin sheath for some unknown reason according to the medical authorities

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 becomes worn away or taken away and the nerves stop functioning

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 and people start having trouble with motor control.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 They say it's caused by inflammation and how does that relate to your idea?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 I think it causes a lack of energy.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 It will cause a tissue to swell up, take up water and as it swells up the tissue tries to renew itself.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 Cells are always renewing themselves in a tremendous churning process

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 of taking down the old stuff and putting up new stuff.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 For example, someone said that during the night I think it was 60% of our molecules in our brain,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 the fat substance that's a big part of the brain, 60% of them are totally re-synthesized every night

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 and just an hour after death a massive amount of the brain substance has decomposed

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 because it isn't constantly being reconstituted.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 So you have to think in terms of a healthy stable organism as being in extremely intense turnover processes.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 And so if you cut off the energy supply the first thing that happens is the cell takes up water

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 and that excites the restorative process to run faster.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 But if it takes up more and more water that shifts the whole direction

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 and the cell at a certain stage of excitation will de-differentiate

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 and try to turn into a stem cell to grow new tissue as a healing process.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 And if there's even less energy then that process stops.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 But when you have just a chronic slight energy deprivation you get a chronic slight edema

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 and that edema one of the things that happens is that the myelin swells up

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 and while it's being taken down it isn't being re-synthesized efficiently.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Thyroid, progesterone, pregnenolone and saturated fatty acids are things that support the reforming of the myelin.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 And when the energy is down for example thyroid is low then you can't make the pregnenolone and progesterone

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 and so you just can't synthesize it as fast as it's being taken down.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 So it's really a condition where you're put under stress

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 and you don't have the energy resources to keep rebuilding yourself under that stress.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 Yeah and it's just remarkably similar in the processes in the degenerative brain diseases of aging

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 or the development of cancer or of deforming arthritis,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 inflammation, chronic inflammation like pancreatitis, hepatitis, chronic kidney disease and so on.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 All the same processes are involved just in different proportions of energy supply and irritation or stimulation.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Is that what Georgie referred to as the condition of being sick?

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 Yeah, that was Hanselier.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 Oh, it was Hanselier, thank you.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 Yeah and that's just a shortage of energy basically.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 Yeah, I think the gap between stimulation and energy resources,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 it's been used to define excitotoxicity that kills brain cells

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 but it's really the same process in your pancreas or kidney or skin

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 and you are exactly the same energy systems.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Slight differences in the particular proteins that are like in Huntington's disease,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 there's that polyglutamine repeat that accumulates

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 but it's really just a symptom of an inflammatory state

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 with a particular history that leads to that being a problem.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 But the fact that it usually waits until you're 40 years old

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 means that the same with rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 or any of these chronic inflammatory things,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 they almost never develop in little kids.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 It takes a while being exposed to certain environments

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 for each kind of thing to develop.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 But there are a few common factors in the organism and its environment

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 that are involved in almost all of these.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 Lou Gehrig's disease, Huntington's,

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 the various nervous dementia diseases and--

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 MS.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 Yeah, and the skeletal nervous inflammatory--

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 diabetes even involves inflammation

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 and the failure to regenerate properly.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Beta cells are being killed in the same way that brain cells are being killed, basically.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 And instead of making insulin, as the cells are renewed,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 the cells are killed as fast as they're renewed, so they stop making insulin.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 But if you stop killing them, then they can start making insulin again.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Same with the brain.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 If you stop killing the brain,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 it's always in the process of repair and regeneration.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 I might have mentioned a man with ALS that I talked to about, I guess,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 eight or 10 years ago, 70 years old.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 And he had had all the best neurologists examine him,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 and he absolutely was convinced he had Lou Gehrig's disease

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 and was declining the same as other people he met in the neurology offices.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 And he decided to start doing things to stop inflammation and support repair.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 And he did them consistently for a few months while still declining.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 But then he stopped declining and within a few months was repaired.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 It was less than a year of the whole process.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 And people he had met in the neurology offices went ahead

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 with the same rate of decline and were totally disabled by the time he was totally well.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 That's impressive.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 So one of the things you've talked about in terms of helping your body rebuild

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 from conditions like this is basically a very simple thing,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 just keeping your blood sugar up.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 Maybe you can describe what happens when somebody is low on blood sugar,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 reading you talking about what happens, basically this catabolic effect that happens

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 in your body just from low blood sugar, to my mind is pretty convincing

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 about how important it is to keep your blood sugar up.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 Yeah, the first thing when your blood sugar falls because your liver

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 hasn't stored enough glycogen to turn into glucose,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 the first reaction is for adrenaline to increase to try to squeeze more glycogen

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 into your circulation for your brain primarily.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 And when the glycogen is absolutely gone, the adrenaline keeps activating the breakdown

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 of fat and provides increased amounts of circulating fat to make up for the lack of sugar.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 But after the fat becomes a source of energy, your cells still need some sugar

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 to maintain their basic processes, and so they turn protein into sugar.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 And to do that, they increase cortisol, which breaks down muscle, skin, thymus gland.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 The thymus is the first to go, and the cortisol will eat up your muscle and skin

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 and immune system pretty quickly to feed your heart, lungs, and brain to keep them alive.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 And so every time your blood sugar falls, you're shifting over to fat metabolism

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 and breaking down protein so that your muscles are one of the places that store glycogen.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 So as your muscles get smaller, then more burden is put on your liver

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 to keep your blood sugar steady, and that makes your liver progressively suffer.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 And eventually it gets to the point that your brain isn't getting either the right energy

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 or the right kind of energy.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 But one of the things that happens with aging is that we progressively,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 from the time we're born at birth, we're very highly saturated in our fats

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 because they've been formed from glucose in utero, and we can only make saturated,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 monounsaturated, and omega-9 unsaturated fats when we're supplied with either sugar or protein.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 But once we start eating in the ordinary environment,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 our tissues start loading up on the polyunsaturated from the environment.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 By the time a person is 40, the brain is pretty full of either the arachidonic acid series,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 or if they have eaten a lot of fish, there will be mostly the long, highly unsaturated fats,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 which will mostly be the DHA type of fish oil-derived omega-3 fats.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 And even with a pretty average diet, the old person's brain is very highly biased

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 towards the DHA type fats.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 And if you look at Parkinson's disease, their favorite genetic protein that some people like to say

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 is the cause of Parkinson's disease, synuclein is the Parkinson's equivalent

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 of the glutamine repeat of Huntington's or the amyloid or tau fibrils of Alzheimer's disease.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 Each disease tends to have its own protein that goes haywire.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 In the case of Parkinson's, it's the alpha-synuclein, and DHA, the fish type of unsaturated fat,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 causes the synuclein protein to change to its toxic form that appears in Parkinson's disease.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 And saturated fats tend to protect against that.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 So very clearly in Parkinson's, you can see the role of fat in inclining the brain

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 towards that degenerative change in the protein.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 And since pretty much everyone in the environment accumulates these highly unsaturated fats,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 especially in the brain, but in all tissues, with aging, by the time you're 30 or 40,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 you become more and more susceptible to all of the degenerative inflammatory diseases,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 very much in proportion to the unsaturated fats.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 And you can find the breakdown products corresponding to the seriousness of Alzheimer's disease

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 or Huntington's or multiple sclerosis.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 The specific breakdown products, such as acrolein, which comes largely from the omega-3 fats,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 the various reactive breakdown products show that these unstable fats are breaking down

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 at an increased rate in the degenerative brain conditions.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 I see. And you've also, in that sort of cascade of bad effects from low blood sugar,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 after the free fatty acids are released, you said that actually pulls down your whole thyroid system.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 And maybe you could talk about that.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Yes. A series of studies in France about 30 years ago, 25 to 30,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 showed that exactly in proportion to the number of double bonds in the fat,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 increasing from a purely saturated fat, such as uric acid or palmitic acid,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 through oleic acid, increasing with linoleic, even more with linoleic,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 and then greatly with the five and six double bonds.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Each increased double bond impairs the thyroid function at the level of secretion,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 transport, and response.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 They looked at four different systems, different kinds of response in the cell.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 But every one of these was impaired in proportion to the degree of unsaturation

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 of the free fatty acids in the blood.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 When was that study done, Ray?

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 In the '80s, in the Annals of Endocrinology, a French journal.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Well, they are traditionally, and up into recent history,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 the kings of using saturated fat in their cooking.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 French cuisine is known for its use of butter.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 Well, the French have fallen for the propaganda against saturated fats

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 and cholesterol and so on, to the extent that some of their famous fat researchers

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 were convinced that giving a fish oil supplement to pregnant women

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 would make their babies smarter, even though animal studies showed

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 that in proportion to the unsaturation of the fat in the pregnant animal's diet,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 the baby's brains were smaller and less able to learn.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 But anyway, the French fed some pregnant women the unsaturated fats,

00:35:50.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 while measuring the fetus's ability to react to sounds applied to the abdomen.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 And they found that contrary to what they believed would happen,

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 the learning was impaired by the diet with more of the highly unsaturated fats.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 And when the babies were born, in line with the animal experiments,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 their growth was retarded.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 Well, that seems really immoral to be testing that theory out on infants and their mothers.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 Well, the publicity of the animal studies has pretty much suppressed the fact

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 that these fats didn't have consistently good effects on brain and eye development,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 but what got publicized were the few studies showing what were interpreted to be good studies.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 And on the basis of that, the baby food industry was allowed to add these things

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 to their powdered milk for making baby formula.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 But even in the powdered milk, they're so unstable that breakdown products,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 toxic oxidation fragments, are just tremendously increased in these baby food additives.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 But still, the publicity is such that they're promoted as protective.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 So currently, as it stands today, baby formula that people are using

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 has the DHA oils in them?

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 A lot of them do. I don't know if there are some without it.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 Yeah, that's a little discouraging.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 Yeah, I can see adults, you know, going along with different fats

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 and trying things out for themselves, but when you start experimenting with infants,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 it seems like not a very good idea.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 One of the things that happens at the same time these unsaturated fats are accumulating in the body

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 is that the ratio of estrogen to progesterone in the body is increasing.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 So that by the time a woman is 40, she has, in an absolute sense,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 her estrogen is even higher than it was when she was 20.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 But even worse is that her progesterone has decreased,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 and the ratio has shifted very powerfully in the direction of estrogen.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 And estrogen happens to synergize with the polyunsaturated fats

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 so that women have more DHA circulating in their blood,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 and these polyunsaturated activate the action of a given amount of estrogen,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 and at the same time interfere with the production of progesterone and suppress thyroid,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 which has the same bias.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 Lower thyroid increases estrogen, decreases progesterone.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 But the estrogen industry has convinced most doctors that estrogen is good for the brain

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 and for preventing heart disease and strokes and so on,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 so that when the Women's Health Initiative pointed out that estrogen supplements

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 increased dementia, heart attacks, and strokes,

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 and things that reinforced what animal studies had shown,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 the medical establishment took two or three years to respond and come back and say,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 "We must have been wrong with that Women's Health Initiative study

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 to incriminate estrogen in dementia and heart disease."

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 That's what they're saying now, that the study was wrong.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 Yeah, the very heavy propaganda to improve the sales of estrogen,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 which dropped off drastically when that study came out.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 That was a very convincing study.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 Yeah, especially because it absolutely corroborated in not a too strong way,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 but it was absolutely in line with the animal research going back 50 years before that.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 And these diseases we're talking about today, they affect women way more than they affect men.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 I think MS is 10 to 1, and I forget what ALS is.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 Even Alzheimer's, in the '90s it was already well documented that women had two

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 or two and a half times the incidence of Alzheimer's disease as men.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 And in spite of that, people who wanted to sell estrogen said,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 "Well, that's because women's estrogen declines with aging."

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 But in fact, by the age of 40, it has increased tremendously,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 and that's when the brain damage is being done by the bad ratio of estrogen to progesterone.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 I know you've covered this before, Ray,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 but explain how it is that people think estrogen is declining when it actually isn't.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 It's increasing, and the tests just don't pick it up.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 Well, one thing is that the estrogen is stuck when it's in the cells working.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 It's bound to the things they call estrogen receptors.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 And progesterone's effect, which should rise right after ovulation,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 there should be this huge excess of progesterone.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 Progesterone destroys, decomposes the estrogen-binding proteins

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 and activates enzymes that inactivate estrogen, getting it out of the cells.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 So if you're deficient in progesterone, you can't get estrogen out of the cells.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 And it not only stays there, but it even, with its own action,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 it tends to activate enzymes that create more estrogen,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 so that your aromatase in your fat tissue and fibrous tissue and various tissues

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 increases making fat outside of the ovaries as you age.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 Even in a young monkey, they were studying the estrogen output in the ovary,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 and as a control, they used the blood coming from the arm veins

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 and found that the monkey's arm was producing more estrogen than its ovary was.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 And that process increases with age.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 But most of the estrogen, when you're deficient in progesterone,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 most of the estrogen stays inside cells working, affecting the cells,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 rather than getting out into the blood where it could be excreted.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 And so the only way you can really tell how much estrogen influence a person has

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 when they're 50 years old is to take a snip of tissue and analyze its estrogen content.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 And on top of our bodies producing more estrogen as we age,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 we have a huge environmental load coming down on us,

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 because many of the chemicals we use in our modern lifestyle are estrogenic,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 and plus pollution is estrogenic.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 In the 1930s, before the estrogen industry took off,

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 people were studying what estrogen is and does,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 and they found that soot is estrogenic,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 and that the same things that produce the estrogen effect produce inflammation and cancer,

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 and that basically it's a process of cell excitation,

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 followed or accompanied by blocking oxidative energy production.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 And that was pretty much covered up when the estrogen industry convinced doctors

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 that estrogen was the female hormone that would prevent infertility and aging and so on.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 Yeah, good for their business and bad for everybody else.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 The interaction of estrogen as an excitatory thing with the polyunsaturated fats,

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 which are excitatory things,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 these besides producing inflammation and blocking energy production,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 they activate other systems.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 For example, the glutamate, glutamic acid,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 it's why monosodium glutamate produces brain injury,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 because that excites cells to the point that if there's not enough energy supply,

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 the cells will die.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 But estrogen and the unsaturated fats both activate this glutamate excitatory system,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 and those interact, all of them to increase a set of enzymes.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 The transglutaminase is the enzyme that's involved in celiac disease,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 the gluten sensitivity disease.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 And this enzyme is normally involved in maturing cells that are under the influence of stress,

00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 as in the surface of the skin when it's maturing into a hardened keratinized layer,

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 or in the uterus as estrogen is causing the lining of the uterus to mature

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 and cause keratinized cells to form.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 But in the brain, this excitation from unsaturated fats, lipid peroxidation,

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 breakdown, and estrogen, and the glutamic acid system,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 these excite the formation of the transglutaminase.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 And transglutaminase happens to form polymers and fibrils

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 and deposits of these various enzymes that are known to accumulate in Huntington's,

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and so on.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 The tau protein, for example, in Alzheimer's disease,

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 transglutaminase activates a reaction at the end of the tau protein,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 or in various places with all of these other proteins that accumulate and form fibrils.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 And this enzyme works on amino groups,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 which when the metabolism is healthy and producing energy by use of oxidative metabolism,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 it's producing a constant supply of carbon dioxide.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 And carbon dioxide spontaneously combines with amino groups,

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 all kinds of amino groups.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 Every protein in the body should have a supply of carbon dioxide,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 preventing the action of enzymes such as transglutaminase,

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 which would bind them and cause them to condense and form fibrils.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 And I suspect that in places where estrogen is dominant,

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 or in the skin where the cells are exposed to pure air,

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 the carbon dioxide is displaced either by the effect of estrogen

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 or just by the high saturation of oxygen.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 And the absence of the carbon dioxide allows this transglutaminase,

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 the cross-link, inactivate and harden the proteins.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 But when it happens inside your brain,

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 you get these abnormal deposits of protein that should only happen in cells

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 that are terminally differentiating and getting ready to slough off.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
 And your body's getting rid of.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 Yeah.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 So CO2 is very important to the health of the body.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 There was a survey in Nepal at very high altitudes.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 They found lots of sick people,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 but they didn't find the degenerative brain diseases

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 that you would expect at lower altitude, poor populations.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 And I suspect that it's because when you adapt to high altitude,

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 your body retains a much higher level of carbon dioxide.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 Your blood is more in the carbamino state, but probably all your proteins are.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000
 And you've said that reduced thyroid function,

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 not having enough of the active thyroid hormone, T3,

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 if you don't have enough, that's when you start having trouble

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 not only with energy levels, but also the myelin sheath.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 Your nerves can't regenerate without the T3; is that right?

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 Yeah.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 The first five people that I met who had a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis,

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 I was starting to believe there wasn't such a thing as multiple sclerosis

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 because all of those first five people had such classical symptoms of hypothyroidism.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 I pointed that out.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 When they took thyroid, their symptoms totally disappeared.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 So it's very easy to confuse hypothyroidism with multiple sclerosis.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 So in the few minutes we have left, Raymond,

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000
 maybe you could just run over what are some of the simple things people can do

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 to alleviate their symptoms or even avoid them entirely.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 Well, it's known that aspirin prevents most of these degenerative conditions.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 People who have chronically used some aspirin are much less likely to have Parkinson's or Alzheimer's.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 And caffeine is another generally protective thing against inflammation, fibrosis, and degeneration.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 And avoidance of the polyunsaturated fats, I think, is the basic and most important thing,

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 and avoiding antithyroid foods.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 The worst antithyroid foods are these polyunsaturated fats.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 And protein levels, keeping your protein level up.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 Yeah, and gelatin seems to have a therapeutic anti-inflammatory effect.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:31.000
 So eating the cheapest cuts of meat, bones, and skin.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 In the U.S., few people eat the skin, and since the fat avoidance fad,

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 people tend to eat skinless chicken and so on.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 But when the animals are fed a good diet, the skin fat is more saturated.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 So pork rinds are a very good source of gelatin.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 And if you boil a chicken, even without the feet and other parts,

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 the skin and bones will release a lot of gelatin, which is an anti-inflammatory protective protein.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 And you mentioned how important it is to keep your blood sugar up to handle stresses.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
 And how should one do that?

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
 I have a feeling that a lot of our problems today, at least in some people,

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 is that they're avoiding sugar because it's gotten such a bad rap.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 Yeah, every day I hear at least one or two people saying what happened when they started eating sugar.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 One guy this morning said his hair stopped falling out a couple days after he started eating sugar.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:50.000
 A kid who was having seizures and had gone down to 112 pounds in just two or three weeks

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:59.000
 is back up to his normal weight from eating something like eight or nine ounces of sugar added to his other foods.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 In a crisis, sugar in itself, just a simple honey or sugar can be very therapeutic.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 But in general, you want to shift your diet towards fruit rather than grains and starchy vegetables.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:25.000
 Just to finish up, you were saying that starches were a bad way to get sugar, like wheat is bad.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 Yeah, partly because of the other things they're associated with.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:37.000
 But one of the things they do harmfully is to support bacterial growth.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 The poorly cooked starches or the more undercooked vegetables and complex forms of starch support bacterial growth.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 And bacteria produce endotoxin, and endotoxin works with these other pro-inflammatory things.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 Some of the structural changes of the degenerative proteins are very similar to the structure that is defensive against endotoxin.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 So some of them might be provoked by the presence of endotoxin as a defensive reaction.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 But it's well known that the polyunsaturated fats activate the prion formation and so on.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 But the unsaturated fats are probably biologically analogous to the endotoxin produced by the bacteria.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 Yes, and you've written a lot about the relationship of maldigestion of food creating a lot of the problems that we've been talking about or helping to exacerbate them.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:09.000
 Yeah, and the unsaturated fats contribute even at the digestive level because they interfere with protein digestive enzymes

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 as well as after they get into the bloodstream.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 Well, we've filled up the hour, Ray.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 It's gone very fast, and I really appreciate you coming on Politics and Science again.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 And perhaps at some point we can follow up and get into some of the details of how digestion does relate to disease

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 because I think that's something that the medical world doesn't cover at all.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 Yeah, if you go back to the mid-19th century, you see that medicine was really making progress.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 And then into the 20th century, the Russians were continuing digestive physiology.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:02.000
 But after about 1920s in the U.S., it was pretty much ignored.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 All right, well, thanks so much for sharing your knowledge with us, and I'll give out your contact information when we're done.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 Okay.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 All right, thanks a lot, Ray.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000
 Yeah, bye-bye.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 Bye.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:20.000
