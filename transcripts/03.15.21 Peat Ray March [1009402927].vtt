00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
 Expensive and bad information.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.120
 Know the source.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.400
 OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.280
 - Well, a very pleasant good morning to you

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.200
 and for those of you who just heard our first show,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.560
 well, welcome back.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.920
 We just had to take a little break here

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.920
 to get connected up.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.360
 It didn't take long.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.840
 My name is Patrick Timpone

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.720
 and we are live here this morning,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.200
 live with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.080
 Dr. Peat is a PhD.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.920
 He's been at this a very long time.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.840
 It is raypeat.com

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.640
 and you can get his newsletter.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.120
 We'll tell you how to do that.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.120
 He has an amazing amount of material there,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.200
 all kinds of articles that will,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.120
 I think will help you to look at health

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.120
 in a way that a man with many, many years of experience,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.280
 going back to his work with progesterone and hormones

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.680
 back into the mid 60s

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.680
 and he's done papers in physiological chemistry

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.600
 and physics in '71 and '72.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.200
 His dissertation, University of Oregon in '72,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.760
 outlined ideas regarding progesterone

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.200
 and hormones closely related to it.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.880
 Dr. Ray Peat is here on the third Monday of each month

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.280
 and it's just, Dr. Peat,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.440
 thank you so much for coming once a month

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.360
 and appreciate your patience

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.160
 with starting a little bit late.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.720
 How are things up in the Northwest, sir?

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.680
 - Oh, pretty good.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.800
 The weather has been warmer than usual

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.600
 for several days now, a little rain.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.920
 - Yeah, but things are well up there, huh?

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.120
 - Yeah, spring is coming on.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.120
 - Before we, I wanna talk a little bit

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.560
 about the exosomes and viruses and Zach Bush's work

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.240
 that I got turned on more mostly because of you.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.640
 You mentioned it last month.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.560
 What are some of the biggest things

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.760
 that you have learned over the years

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.440
 looking at hormones and progesterone and all that?

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.800
 I think, what now, almost 40 years, right?

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.840
 Did you come across a lot of things that you changed

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.000
 and your whole idea changed on it,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.080
 research and experience over those years?

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.480
 - Oh, yeah, my own diet has changed a lot

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.880
 as I'm studying the effects of estrogen

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.880
 interacting with fertility and aging in animals, for example.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.320
 I came across lots of research going back to the 1940s

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.760
 showing that the polyunsaturated fats are estrogenic,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.000
 that vitamin E, going back to the Schutz work in the 1930s,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.840
 is an anti-estrogen, anti-inflammatory.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.440
 Estrogen is both pro-inflammation

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.280
 and pro-cancer and pro-aging.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.280
 But the arrival of the estrogen industry in 1940

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.200
 changed the world's interpretation of not only estrogen

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.920
 but vitamin E and the polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.920
 So that was kind of a turning point in my diet.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.040
 - Interesting.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.000
 So vitamin E, even supplementally, Dr. Pete,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.480
 is a good anti-estrogen thing,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.480
 which generally is good to keep estrogen happy,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.760
 or did I misinterpret what you say?

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.360
 - Yeah, it's anti-inflammatory

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.600
 and that amounts pretty much to being anti-estrogenic.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.600
 And vitamin E facilitates good oxidation

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.880
 where estrogen interferes with the proper use of oxygen.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.160
 That's the core function of estrogen

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.160
 is to block normal respiration of cells.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.760
 - Do you think we get enough,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.560
 can we get enough vitamin E through the sunlight?

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.560
 - No, vitamin E--

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.920
 - I'm sorry, I'm confusing D and E.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.480
 Sorry, I got confused.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.120
 Go ahead, yeah.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.080
 - If we have a diet free of polyunsaturated fats

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.800
 and no exposure to estrogens,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.800
 then we need extremely little vitamin E

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.160
 because its main function is defensive

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.160
 against the estrogenic substances and polyunsaturated fats.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.080
 But if you are already fairly well saturated

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.960
 with the PUFA fats,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.200
 then your requirement for vitamin E

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.240
 goes up and up with aging.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.160
 Some studies suggested that the older you get,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.680
 the more vitamin E you need

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.800
 just to prevent the rancidity

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.160
 of the polyunsaturated fats in your tissues.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.960
 Some studies suggested that it reached a need

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.200
 for 400 milligrams of vitamin E per day

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.440
 by the time of middle age or menopause.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.920
 But at that point, no matter how much you take,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.040
 the rancidity is going to take over

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.560
 and have an estrogenic pro-aging,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.800
 pro-inflammatory effect.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.800
 So the only real solution is to minimize the absorption

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.880
 of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.920
 - And what are the biggest ones that people consume

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.240
 ongoing, say, in our culture, PUFAs?

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.280
 Would that be like the Wesson oil and these kinds of things,

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.920
 these really bad oils from the store?

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.160
 - The liquid oils.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.880
 And fish oil is a newer addition,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.680
 but it's especially bad, fish oils and algae oils.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:23.520
 But the seed oils like cottonseed oil and canola and so on.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.440
 In the lab when I was working on the effects of estrogen

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.160
 on those fatty acids in the body,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.160
 I bought a bottle of some kind of Wesson oil

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.080
 or something like that, a liquid oil.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.480
 I had my apparatus set up for measuring

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.240
 animal oxygen consumption,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.000
 and I just put a rubber tube attached to the top

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.160
 of this quart of vegetable oil,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.720
 put the other end in a beater of water,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.960
 and I came back a couple of hours later

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.320
 and the water had been drawn up the tube.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.320
 The oil itself, a bottle full of oil,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.640
 but with a cap off and exposed to oxygen,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.680
 was consuming oxygen just like there was

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.240
 a little animal in the bottle respiring.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.480
 So the oil constantly, on exposure to air,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.040
 is becoming rancid, and that was at room temperature

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.000
 that the bottle of oil was sucking up the oxygen.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.640
 And imagine at 98 degrees Fahrenheit

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.640
 how fast that rancidity process is going to be consuming

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.360
 the oxygen in your tissues.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.440
 That makes it act like estrogen to compete

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.380
 against your mitochondrial energy production.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.240
 Your fat cells begin sucking up the oxygen,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.840
 and then the polyunsaturated fats

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.840
 reaching the mitochondrion will slow,

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.040
 just destroy, damage its ability to use oxygen.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:24.040
 - So olive oil is a monounsaturated,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.880
 not considered a real PUFA,

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.320
 even though it has some PUFA kind of characteristics?

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.200
 - Yeah, where some of the oils are 50 or 60% PUFA,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:39.200
 olive oil is eight or 10 or 11% PUFA.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.480
 So it's much, much safer than--

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.320
 - Sure.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.200
 - And butter is 3%, roughly.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.840
 - Good for butter, huh?

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.600
 Yeah, wow. - Yeah, much better.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.720
 - So what do you think is the safest way,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.400
 my grandma used to buy these great Italian olive oils

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.160
 at the Italian store, and they were in tins,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.360
 and she would keep it in a cool spot in the closet.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.640
 Do you think a dark bottle or tins,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.240
 or what would be the best place to store?

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.600
 Do you have any theories?

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.140
 - Well, it should be in a very cool place,

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.640
 best if it's in a refrigerator so it's solid.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.880
 - Really, huh.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.120
 - First of all, you wanna make sure it's actual olive oil,

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.360
 and tastes good, properly like olives.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.120
 The agriculture department, I think it was about 20 years ago

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.640
 sampled the olive oil being sold in the US,

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.840
 and found that 70% of it was tainted

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.840
 with things like canola that are cheaper.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.200
 So it's somewhat of a gamble

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.600
 whether you're getting real pure olive oil,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.440
 and pretty much you can tell it by the taste.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.600
 - You have to be careful.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.960
 So, so many of the so-called natural foods today,

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.560
 Dr. Ray Peet, have canola oil,

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.240
 and you can even get many of them now

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.880
 are using organic canola oil to make it sound better,

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.360
 but I take it you're just not a fan of eating this canola.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.200
 - No, not at all.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.000
 - Not at all, you just don't wanna do it.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.400
 Just don't wanna do it, huh.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.600
 - The reason the marketing started was that

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:36.600
 things like safflower oil and soybean oil

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:42.000
 used to be used as the basis for making paints and plastics.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.120
 And the oil chemists learned how to make

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.960
 similar, much cheaper paints and plastics from petroleum.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:00.240
 So all of these seed oils lost their market as paint base.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.680
 And the marketing people discovered

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.480
 that if they could say that they contain

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.440
 something essential for nutrition,

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.800
 then they could say they're good for you.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.960
 Even though the so-called essential oils,

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.840
 the daily requirement is in milligrams rather than grams.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.920
 So there's no basis for saying that

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.640
 eating liquid oils is somehow related

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.400
 to an essential nutrient.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.760
 It's all marketing that made up

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.560
 for the petroleum paint industry takeover.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.120
 - So even extra virgin organic olive oil

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.560
 is more a luxury for taste

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.480
 rather than a necessary nutrient in your opinion?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.480
 - Oh yeah, it does have antioxidants, vitamin E,

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.480
 and a lot of very effective health-related ingredients.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:09.080
 So if you're getting a little olive oil,

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.480
 probably those beneficial things are offsetting

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.440
 the moderate amount of proofer you're getting.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.480
 - Dr. Ray Peet is here.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.400
 We are live March 15th, 2021.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.080
 If you have a question, we have lots of good ones already.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.880
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.920
 I did not really have seen a lot of things

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.440
 by Dr. Zach Bush.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.760
 And last month you had mentioned that you,

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.160
 you know, we were talking about the exosomes

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.480
 and the virus and the germ theory,

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.720
 and you thought that his work was interesting to you.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.840
 And I watched a three-hour video.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.840
 I don't know if you've seen this one.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.080
 I think it was not,

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.680
 it's only been around two or three weeks.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.600
 It was a three-hour documentary that he put together.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.600
 And on the face of it,

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.480
 it looks like he's onto a lot of interesting things,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.800
 but he's talking about from the beginning

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.280
 that I wanted to ask you about this idea

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.720
 that these viruses, what they call viruses,

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.040
 have been around forever, right?

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.640
 I mean, just really since the beginning of time,

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.240
 and there's just thousands, millions,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.560
 billions of them everywhere.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.880
 Like he says in the air,

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.880
 there's 10 to the 30th of viruses in the air,

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.760
 10 to the 15th in the body.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.640
 I mean, that's more than the stars, right?

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.880
 I mean, that's, yeah, and in the soil.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.840
 And that these viruses that they're called

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.560
 are circulating throughout the whole world

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.120
 without the need for a human transition.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.200
 - Oh, they live in simplest organisms.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.080
 Bacteria have their viruses,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.000
 fungus, plants.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.960
 Every organism has its so-called viruses.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.960
 But the complex, long chain of nucleic acids

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.880
 that is the essential component of the virus,

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.800
 you don't get the construction of this

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.800
 extremely functional, organized bit of DNA or RNA

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.240
 just in a vacuum.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:26.680
 They require the living cell to reproduce.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.440
 And it happens that living cells

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.760
 communicate between each other like bacteria.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.760
 If they learn, if they adapt to an antibiotic,

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.040
 they put together a little packet

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.040
 of what they learned in their DNA

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.880
 and pass it on to other bacteria,

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.120
 even of different species.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.120
 And that packet of DNA is spreading

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.080
 the ability to resist antibiotics.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.640
 And that's going on constantly.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.360
 And not just bacteria, but higher organisms

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.800
 are emitting particles equivalent

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.360
 to the bacterial capsid or particle

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.280
 that transfers the ability to adapt better

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.720
 to the environment.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.720
 And plants and fungus and animals

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.240
 all have this going on in their own tissues.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:33.360
 One tissue sends out messages to another tissue

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.120
 and can recruit assistance from other parts

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:43.120
 of the organism or send out repair particles

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.520
 to help other parts.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.520
 And these particles circulate in all the body fluids.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:59.920
 A mother's milk contains these exosomes

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.920
 of virus-like structures that are ingested by the baby.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.680
 The sweat, the urine, the saliva,

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.400
 all of our fluids contain these intrinsic

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.240
 communication particles that are working

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.960
 back and forth within our own tissues.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.160
 But they're in our body fluids

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.520
 and they get into the environment

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.560
 and can affect other organisms.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.880
 And if it happens that it's something

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.640
 that works well in a plant,

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.320
 when it gets into an animal,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.560
 it might be exactly the wrong thing.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.120
 It might send out very confused signals

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.560
 trying to repair a plant cell

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.640
 when it's in your liver or something.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.640
 And so these signals are alien

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.680
 when they're taken up randomly

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.880
 and our bodies have to decide what to do with them.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:07.000
 And much of this stuff gets tucked away

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.600
 for future reference in case it might come

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.440
 from a bacteria that knew something you should know

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.680
 but is at the moment not useful.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.400
 So it gets tucked away in our DNA.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.400
 And about 97 to 98% of our DNA

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.720
 consists of strands that do not produce proteins.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:36.440
 The genes that people have studied in genetics

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:41.440
 for 120 years are strips of DNA

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:49.520
 that contain information for making protein.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.280
 But those amount to only 2 or 3% of all of our DNA.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.280
 And much of the rest of it, at least 48 or 50%,

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.400
 it has the structure that would suggest

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.520
 it came from viruses.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.520
 But since viruses can't evolve by themselves,

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:14.480
 there really, it turns out that our internal exosomes

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.760
 that are repair modules,

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.160
 it turns out that they create exactly,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.320
 even the covering protein that we think of

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.480
 as what makes a virus travel and get into other cells,

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.240
 even that covering protein turns out to be

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.240
 something intrinsic to our own regulatory systems.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:44.440
 So since we share them,

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:50.120
 you can treat them as viruses,

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.760
 but they are built, they evolved and developed

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.760
 as part of our ability to guide development.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.640
 And when these are acting during gestation,

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:10.200
 they're like the things we call cytokines.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:15.200
 During gestation, these virus-like or exosomal

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.480
 strands of DNA are interacting with the

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:26.280
 potentially inflammatory cytokines

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:31.280
 as perfectly essential and harmless guides

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.440
 to creating the fetus.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:40.600
 They are essential parts of forming the human being.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:49.120
 And what happens in stressful environments,

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.240
 these things don't have adequate support

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.440
 of nutrition and oxygen and carbon dioxide and so on.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.560
 So under stress, these things that are part of our

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:06.560
 formative, protective DNA and cytokine system,

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:13.560
 these turn out to be maladaptive under bad stress

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:19.080
 and so they act like viruses when we're too stressed

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.680
 to put them to proper use.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.680
 - So that's why Bush argues that in the body,

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:33.200
 these exosomes and our viruses, exosomes,

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.640
 the body chooses whether or not it needs them.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.480
 - Yeah, right.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.360
 - It actually makes a choice.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.760
 - Right, that's why healthy people don't have to worry.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.360
 - That's why they don't get sick.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.200
 (laughing)

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.920
 So then flu symptoms, and following what you're saying

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.720
 and Bush, it's not a bad thing.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.800
 It's a genetic update and the body's actually

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.400
 getting stronger because of it, yes?

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.960
 - Right, like studies have found that kids

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.960
 who had normal measles when they were in grade school

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.520
 or so are resistant to cancer later in life.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.360
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:16.600
 You know, Dr. Piedmont, when I grew up in grade school

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.000
 in the 50s, we got the measles and mom put us to bed

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.720
 for a couple days and that was it.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.120
 And it was just no big deal.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.640
 We just went back to school.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:30.000
 - Yeah, the whole vaccine thing,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.560
 it was the smallpox vaccine after thousands of years

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.560
 of practice, it became a usable medical tool

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:49.360
 and finally in the 1960s, they decided that they would

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:54.000
 get organized about it and instead of vaccinating people

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 where there hadn't been any cases of smallpox for decades,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.680
 they decided to use it in a new outbreak and encircle

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.080
 the area where it was becoming an epidemic

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.880
 and keep it from spreading.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:17.480
 So in just a few years, two or three years

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.480
 of actual organized activity, they eliminated smallpox

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.760
 from the world.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.000
 But if you use a vaccine in that way,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 you lose your market for selling vaccines.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 So the vaccine for smallpox was used intelligently

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.640
 and then there was no more market for selling it.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.160
 So they never made that mistake again.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:48.920
 The policy now is to vaccinate healthy people.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.400
 Even though you kill some of them,

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.040
 it will keep the market going if you instill the idea

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.160
 that vaccines are something everyone should have.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.880
 - So what did this organism, two questions.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.680
 So an organism that was involved in an experience

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.680
 called smallpox is an organism that was not trying

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:16.460
 to do some kind of good for the person?

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.400
 - It was possibly--

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.720
 - Or could be the same thing, only the weak got sick.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.360
 - Yeah, in the great smallpox epidemics,

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.000
 there were always a considerable portion

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.640
 of the population that never didn't get it.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.960
 And things like getting enough sunlight and vitamin D

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.960
 and a good diet accounted for why those healthy people

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.880
 didn't have any problem with smallpox.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.360
 - So this smallpox particle was not,

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.280
 its mission in life was not to kill people.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.500
 - Yeah, it might have been to,

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.500
 make mice resistant to mosquitoes or something.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:10.260
 It might have had some useful function in some organism.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.260
 But when it got in people, if their immune systems

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:18.080
 couldn't adjust to it and take care of it,

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.360
 then they would develop the disease of smallpox.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:27.340
 - But at the end, if they had the proper,

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.940
 I don't care, would the people

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.960
 that even experienced smallpox,

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.140
 could it be argued that they would actually

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.400
 be better off for it if they lived through it?

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.140
 No?

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:45.140
 - Probably, but it would be better to be exposed

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.780
 to the smallpox and handle it well

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.780
 so you didn't even get maybe an itch

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.020
 where it hit your skin or nose or whatever.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:25:00.020
 - I see, which is the idea that they even do it today

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:03.020
 where moms who understand the measles month things,

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.920
 they'll actually have measles parties.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:10.980
 Right, so they'll send the kids to the party

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.460
 and drink out of Joe's cup

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.460
 because you guys can share this thing.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:20.660
 - Yeah, and several big studies in India, for example,

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:26.580
 have shown that just vitamin D or just vitamin A,

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:31.300
 just some very economical change in the diet

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:37.180
 stops the plagues of whatever, polio

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:42.660
 or other viral, so-called viral diseases.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:47.740
 Just a very economical improvement of living conditions

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.220
 will prevent those deadly plagues

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.740
 that they happen in populations under stress,

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.740
 having famines and exposure to very bad diets, toxins,

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:10.980
 and just by having a normal, clean, well-fed environment,

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.620
 you don't have plagues.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:21.080
 - So similar to people who die from scurvy,

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.640
 and then, oh, they gave them limes or vitamin C

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.240
 or something and they were fine.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:32.320
 - Yeah, yeah, the vitamin D and A

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.160
 happen to be the ones currently recognized

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.840
 as providing resistance to viruses,

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.320
 but vitamin C had that function a couple hundred years ago.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.940
 - So I wondered, before we start processing food,

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.300
 well, I guess people always had stress, right?

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.420
 They were fighting somebody or dinosaurs or who knows,

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.740
 right, or big snakes or Indians.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.160
 I guess they always had stress,

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.420
 so there was always a, it was kind of poetry in motion,

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.540
 Dr. Pete, of who was getting sick

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.340
 or who had symptoms and who weren't.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:15.540
 - Well, as the agriculture became

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.900
 the food basis of civilization,

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:24.900
 grains became an excessive part of our diet.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.620
 Grains provide polyunsaturated fats

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.980
 and a variety of toxic nutrients,

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:37.060
 as well as a minimal amount of survival protein.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:42.060
 So the more you lived on a grain-based diet,

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.500
 the more likely you were to have a plague,

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.140
 an epidemic of viruses, bacteria, and so on.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.580
 - Dr. Ray Pete is with us.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.580
 We're live here this morning, March 15th, 2021.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.940
 Do you think that this human body that you and I are in

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.700
 and our listeners could have actually evolved

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:05.780
 all the way from the ocean,

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:09.300
 all the way out to where we are today?

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.180
 What's your, what is your theory on that?

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.980
 - I don't think there's any good reason

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.900
 for thinking of the ocean as the source.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:24.900
 That the idea of a membrane enclosing seawater

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:32.660
 to account for why we have our mineral composition and so on,

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:36.300
 it's completely unfounded.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.460
 - That's not, well, what about,

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.380
 what if we leave the ocean out of it?

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.020
 Do you think our species,

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.620
 the bodies that we have in body right now,

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:50.060
 evolve from low forms of bacteria and viruses

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.580
 and came to where we are today?

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.860
 - No, no, the viruses evolved from us.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.620
 - The viruses evolved us.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.740
 So how does that work?

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:09.140
 - The exosomes that we need to make ourselves,

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:14.060
 they're shared, and when you share them

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.740
 with someone who isn't healthy,

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.860
 then they become a virus or a disease source.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.740
 - When we share them with somebody,

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.140
 but if they do okay with it and work through it,

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.340
 aren't they gonna be healthier at the end of it?

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.740
 - Yeah.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.900
 - So they should thank us when we give them the flu.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:32.740
 Just kidding.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.020
 (laughing)

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:40.020
 - Yeah, a good ecosystem isn't riddled with disease.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.740
 It's a collapsing ecosystem that experiences things

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.540
 like viral and bacterial epidemics.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.020
 - But Bush was saying there's something

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.700
 like these retroviruses, and he had the name of it,

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.660
 that without all these retroviruses,

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.840
 this was the way that we actually became,

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.940
 evolved into mammals and had babies in the tummy

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.540
 rather than laying eggs.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.100
 - Yeah, I think that's true.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.220
 - Did I get that right?

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:12.700
 - Right, yeah.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:17.700
 The so-called dark DNA, that 98% that doesn't make proteins,

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:24.380
 that's part of our structuring system,

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:29.380
 and our dark DNA, non-coding DNA,

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:36.260
 is different from the egg-laying organisms.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.960
 That's where our difference lies.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:44.100
 - So somehow there had to be an intelligence

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.720
 or a desire, working with God, whatever God is,

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:53.300
 to wanna move from eggs to tummies somehow.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.140
 - Right.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.140
 - We had to have a desire to do it,

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.380
 or that never would have happened, right?

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:02.380
 - Yeah, James A. Shapiro, a bacteria geneticist,

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:08.660
 has written, and there are some very good videos

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:14.420
 explaining how bacteria have a very highly developed

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:19.960
 level of intelligence.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:25.660
 The idea that the world lacks intelligence

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:31.620
 is it's kind of an anti-religious bias

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.380
 or built-in philosophy to deny

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.380
 that intelligence is everywhere.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.260
 - It's just everywhere.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.580
 - Yeah.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:49.860
 - So then the whole evolution and the divine,

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.220
 what do they call it, God theory or evolution,

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.900
 and what's the other one, the opposite,

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.580
 of theories and evolution?

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.140
 - Well, the standard--

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.700
 - Standard one.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.500
 - The neo-Darwinism is based on the assumption

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.380
 that the world is basically random

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:10.980
 and stupid and accidental.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:11.820
 - Right, right.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:18.220
 So they all, it kind of works together, doesn't it,

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.100
 the whole thing, if everything is intelligent

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.380
 and somehow a part of divine intelligence,

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.540
 which we might call God.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.020
 I mean, it makes sense to me.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.940
 You?

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.940
 - Yeah, actual, normal reasoning processes

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:35.940
 will lead you there.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:40.580
 You know the famous work on math

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.220
 that Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:47.420
 produced around the early part of the 20th century?

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:52.240
 After they worked together on pure logic,

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:57.060
 Whitehead went off in his direction.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:02.060
 He actually started using terms like God,

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.700
 but strictly building it on the same clear thinking

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.820
 that Bertrand Russell and he had developed.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:16.020
 And so there's nothing anti-philosophical

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.740
 or anti-scientific.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.260
 You can use that terminology

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:26.380
 without having to be a member of a church or something.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:27.580
 - Uh-huh, yeah.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.820
 Dr. Ray Peat is here.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.340
 His website is raypeat.com.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.380
 You can get his newsletter.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:39.380
 It's just raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.580
 raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:48.100
 So can it be assumed or argued

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.740
 that all of these things we call dis-eases,

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.100
 regardless of what they are,

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:57.180
 it's possible that on some level spiritually,

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.460
 you and I and our listeners,

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.420
 we're trying to evolve.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.780
 We're trying to get stronger.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.700
 We're trying to move and change and to grow.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:12.740
 - Yeah, even people who seem to disagree,

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:16.060
 like Kaufman and Bush,

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.780
 one says there are no viruses.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.260
 The other says viruses are everywhere.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.740
 But still what they have in common

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:25.900
 is there's nothing to panic about.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:30.300
 There's no reality to the fear of the pandemic.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.500
 And what that means is how do you explain

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.500
 what the governments have been doing?

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.940
 And that leads to the political agenda

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.860
 promoted by the World Economic Forum

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:51.140
 with the assistance of Johns Hopkins University

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.460
 and several of the other

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:58.980
 traditionally elitist power groups.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.420
 So there's definitely,

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.940
 I don't think we're conspiracy theorists,

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.580
 whatever that means, or tinfoil hat people,

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.140
 to assume that there's just something rotten in Denmark

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.860
 as far as this whole whatever it's been

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.420
 over the last 18 months, right?

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.900
 - Yeah, one of the key concepts

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.620
 of the Great Reset promoted

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:26.740
 is that no one will own anything.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.100
 You'll rent everything.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:34.100
 Well, they are openly saying

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.140
 you'll rent everything and you'll be happy

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.860
 without owning anything.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.660
 But who are you gonna rent it from?

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:47.140
 The World Economic Forum consists of thousands of people,

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.140
 the billionaire class,

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.780
 who are going to set the prices on everything

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.780
 that you don't own and have to rent.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.820
 So it's very clearly an economic policy

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:06.460
 shaped to benefit only the billionaire class,

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.260
 the monopoly class.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.700
 - I saw an article yesterday, Dr. Pete,

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.220
 where the writer was concerned

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.420
 and he was looking at numbers and saying how

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:21.860
 the richer nations were getting this injection, right,

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.020
 for COVID rather than the poorer nations.

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:28.180
 And this kind of is opposite of what people are arguing

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.540
 that these people, whoever they are,

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:33.620
 are wanting to thin out the population.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:41.220
 - You've seen the video and the articles

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.820
 by Gerd Van Den Bosch?

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.540
 - Yeah, well, I sent you the one video,

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.100
 remember, on the vaccine.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:47.940
 Wow.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.860
 - Yeah, he gets very excited.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:54.860
 He's a working vaccine specialist,

00:36:54.860 --> 00:37:00.140
 well-informed on how the immune system works,

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.500
 unlike people like Fauci,

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.460
 who know nothing about the immune system.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:09.460
 But based on his good understanding

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.220
 of vaccines and immunity,

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:14.540
 he gets very excited and says,

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:19.660
 this might already be too late to stop

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.820
 the terrible disaster that will result

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.940
 from using vaccines in the midst

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.700
 of a well-established pandemic.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.860
 - Can you explain more about that?

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.740
 It was fascinating, the interview.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:35.260
 I mean, and this fellow, Dr. Pete, as you know,

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:36.620
 he's not an anti-vaxxer.

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:39.900
 He creates and creates vaccines for a living.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.580
 This is what he does, right?

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.940
 Can you explain to us, as simply as possible,

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.540
 of his argument?

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:47.940
 And this is more,

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.820
 is this above and beyond the vaccines

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.420
 damaging the innate immune system that Kaufman,

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.740
 I mean, that Cowan wrote about two, three years ago

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.260
 in his book on vaccines.

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.020
 It's more than that, right?

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.140
 Than just damaging the innate immune system?

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.940
 Or is it all the same?

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:07.260
 Is it part of this?

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:12.260
 - Yeah, it's helping to breed a worse virus.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:15.500
 - How is that?

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:16.340
 How is it?

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.860
 Can you explain to us how this works?

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.380
 If you do it in the middle of a pandemic.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:26.300
 - The way the labs developed germ warfare viruses

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:31.660
 was to put them in one organism after another,

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:35.100
 keeping it under pressure.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:39.660
 Not enough immune reaction to destroy it,

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:44.060
 but to make one organism after another sick,

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:49.060
 passing it through dozens of different infected animals.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:57.420
 Each time the virus fails to be destroyed

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:00.420
 by the immune system,

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:03.540
 it has mutated into something

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:07.980
 that resists one immune system after the other.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.820
 And so the lab work decades ago

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.780
 was showing that you can evolve

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:19.540
 a very, very deadly virus in the lab

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:23.580
 just by keeping it transmitting

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.620
 through different organisms.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.620
 And Van den Barsch is saying that

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:33.780
 the proper way to use a vaccine

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:37.140
 is the way the smallpox vaccine was used.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:42.220
 Not in a population that is already well infected,

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:49.980
 but to enclose, surround, and destroy

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.900
 the area where the infection is coming from.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:59.180
 Definitely not vaccinating healthy populations,

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:02.180
 but using it intelligently.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:06.660
 And his point is that the risk is

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:11.260
 that by vaccinating people who are

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.820
 already infected and healthy,

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:18.780
 as well as the susceptible weak ones,

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.220
 that the virus is going to get stronger

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:22.740
 and stronger very quickly.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.700
 - Do you think he's right?

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.100
 - Yeah.

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:31.260
 I don't agree with everything he says,

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.860
 but the vaccine that he developed,

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:39.860
 I think it was called Univax or Univax, something like that,

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:45.180
 was based on the idea of

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:50.340
 making stronger natural killer cells,

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:54.700
 which would be our innate immune system,

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:58.620
 not the specialized vaccine antibodies,

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:03.220
 but a general basic strengthening

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.140
 of the whole immune system

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:08.140
 and eliminating the infected cells

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:11.540
 so they couldn't produce more viruses.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:17.500
 And he points out that when you vaccinate

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.460
 a population and produce lots of people

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:25.460
 with a mass amount of specific antibodies

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:31.580
 for this particular virus,

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.860
 which then is going to change,

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:38.860
 but you've suppressed all of your generalized resistance,

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:46.140
 the basic natural antibodies and natural killer cells

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:51.140
 are subordinated, suppressed by the extreme amplification

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:58.500
 of a specific antibody for a specific virus.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.580
 So you've over-specialized the population

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:07.660
 with this type of badly thought out vaccine.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:14.060
 And the very achievement of a powerful immunity

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:19.060
 against that virus is weakening your general intelligence,

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:23.500
 part of your immune system,

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:27.980
 which can meet and resist

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:31.620
 any unexpected agent.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:32.940
 That becomes weaker.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:33.780
 - Hmm, wow.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:38.780
 - You put all your effort into that fighting a virus,

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:46.180
 which might never recur because the virus changes.

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:51.140
 - And then what could be some of the potential dangers

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:53.700
 to people six months, a year?

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:57.020
 Do we have any idea, or two years, or five years from now?

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.540
 - Well-- - Of taking this injection?

00:42:58.540 --> 00:42:59.380
 Do we know?

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:00.900
 I mean, have any theories?

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.660
 - The certain thing is that you've weakened

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.500
 and over-specialized your immune system.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:11.460
 Many studies have looked at the people

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:16.340
 who got influenza shots the previous year.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.940
 The next year, they are much more susceptible

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:21.420
 to the coronavirus.

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:25.740
 Exactly the thing Vandenbergh was talking about.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:30.420
 The over-specialization for one virus

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:34.060
 weakens your general immunity for everything else.

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:38.340
 - So can it be argued then that this whole corona thing

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:44.340
 18 months ago was no more than just a normal

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:48.180
 everyday life when people get colds and they detox,

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.500
 or whatever you wanna call it, exosomes, viruses,

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.100
 call it what you want.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.740
 And if they would've just left it alone,

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:58.140
 we would have any of this masking all this stuff.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:02.780
 - Yeah, the excess deaths analyzed,

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:06.580
 the data right from the CDC was analyzed

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:09.380
 by Genevieve Briand.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.220
 - Yes.

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:14.260
 - And she showed that their own data

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.460
 that doesn't show any excess deaths.

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:21.460
 It was just a standard flu and cold season.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.180
 And that was it.

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:28.260
 - Yeah, you can't come to any conclusion

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:32.060
 except that there are political agendas

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.780
 creating fear to sell something

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.740
 they're holding in the background.

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:42.940
 - So it's almost like, Dr. Piva,

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:44.780
 it would have to have been a really

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.580
 well-planned out coordinated effort

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:52.060
 between all these people, WHO, CDC, UN,

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:56.580
 the media, the AMA, the whole,

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.700
 has to be, the whole thing was well-planned out.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:03.020
 - Right, the Rockefeller Foundation laid out

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:08.980
 the agenda about 10 years ago.

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:14.060
 And then just months before the pandemic appeared,

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:20.620
 the World Economic Forum and Johns Hopkins University

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:24.020
 had a practice run to get all of the government people

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:27.780
 ready and coordinated with the policy.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:34.260
 So the record is there showing that it has been planned

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.580
 and that nothing real happened,

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:41.580
 but they were pre-informed how they should act

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:45.380
 and the policies that they should put in place,

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:48.140
 not for the public health,

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:51.140
 but for the interests of these,

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:55.660
 of the powerful organizations.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.860
 - And what are your opinions

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.980
 on what some of the motives were, are,

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:02.420
 after, what were you,

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.620
 what were your own intuition deep down?

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.740
 What do you think these motives--

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:11.740
 - Exactly what the founder and chairman

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:16.820
 of the World Economic Forum has written,

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:21.580
 that it's to destroy the existing,

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:24.460
 they call it the legacy economy,

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:29.020
 to destroy the normal existing economies of the world

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:32.940
 and replace them with artificial intelligence

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:38.620
 owned by the monopolies,

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:42.660
 rented out to the public,

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:47.140
 but absolutely under the centralized ownership

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:51.860
 of the digital technology world.

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.380
 - This whole great reset thing,

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.460
 what's gonna be involved

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:58.860
 with a lot of different ideas pushed forward?

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:05.340
 - Yeah, yeah, the digitizing everything,

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:11.180
 eventually having artificial intelligence

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.700
 running school and university courses,

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.820
 as well as medical procedures.

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:28.380
 New York was the first government to acknowledge

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:31.460
 that they were going to start putting in place

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.700
 the program of the World Economic Forum

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:39.700
 to replace normal education with online education,

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:44.380
 normal medicine with digital online medicine,

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:51.060
 replace local economy with online shopping,

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:57.220
 so that the monopolies like Amazon

00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:01.780
 will increase their wealth fabulously.

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.340
 You can see that the billionaire--

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:07.220
 - I saw that, yeah, some of the numbers,

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.260
 some of the numbers of these people.

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:12.700
 So the whole eugenics idea

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.660
 of wanting to thin out the population,

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:17.060
 that's part of this, in your opinion?

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:21.220
 - Yeah, it's interesting that Johns Hopkins University

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:26.220
 was so central with the World Economic Forum

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.620
 in the great reset,

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:30.460
 because they were the founders

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.820
 of the official eugenics office.

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.020
 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:43.300
 was pretty much a creation of Johns Hopkins University

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.420
 and their eugenics people.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:52.780
 Their eugenics ideas inspired the Nazis.

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:58.980
 The US actually passed laws to sterilize people

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:05.580
 that immigrant people who didn't speak English

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:11.380
 became candidates, the poverty class

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:15.100
 of malnourished and sickly people.

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:18.420
 If sickness appeared to run in the family,

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:23.420
 then you could sterilize them under the law of many states.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.540
 Those ideas inspired the Nazis.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:31.540
 So Johns Hopkins history is right in the same line

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:37.580
 as the current great reset policy.

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:41.660
 - But could this not work to their opposite conclusion

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:46.340
 where all the people that they're able to control

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:49.460
 who watch television go to school,

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:54.380
 that they're the ones that maybe won't make it through this

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:57.100
 in the next 10, 20 years?

00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:01.220
 Or become more transhuman?

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:08.140
 - The direction of education under this digitized

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:13.420
 centralization of power,

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:18.420
 it's to turn people into useful, profitable employees

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:26.980
 of these technological monopolies,

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:32.780
 or to let them maybe put them on a pension,

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:36.420
 keep them in powerless poverty.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:42.780
 - Which could be what this whole universal basic income

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:44.500
 is all about and all this stuff

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.900
 that the globalists wanna push forward.

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:51.500
 - Yeah, put the masses of the population on a pension

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:55.860
 and keep them harmless and quiet until they die off.

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.540
 - Harmless and quiet.

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:00.380
 Wow, brave new world.

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.660
 Did you ever think this would come about in your lifetime,

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.220
 Dr. Peaton?

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:07.060
 - I feel that it's happening right now.

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:07.900
 - Yes, sir.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:09.100
 Yeah, I'm sure.

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:09.940
 Please stay there.

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:13.100
 And thanks again, thanks so much for being here.

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:14.460
 We're gonna take a quick break

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:18.260
 and then promote a couple things, products.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:21.300
 This is how we make our little house payment

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:24.340
 and a big house payment, however you wanna say it.

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:25.460
 I don't know why I use that term.

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.140
 Doesn't matter, it's a house payment.

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:28.740
 We're very fortunate to have a house.

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:32.140
 God, I'm so grateful to be able to have a nice home

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.140
 to live in out here in the country.

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:36.020
 And thank you for your ongoing support.

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:40.420
 This is a good thing to do to detox from a lot of stuff.

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:44.740
 - We talk about your health, wealth, and well-being

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:47.140
 on oneradionetwork.com.

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:50.260
 - Well, I did push the wrong button

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:53.380
 and I wanna get it here because I will.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:56.820
 This is a sauna, this is a good one.

00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:00.540
 - Previously with cardiologist, Dr. Joel Kahn,

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:04.020
 35 years experience in cardiology.

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.140
 - On your commercial break, you hit a hot button

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.700
 'cause I'm a giant fan of infrared sauna

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:09.940
 and the cardiac benefits.

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.420
 - Tell us about why you like these saunas for the heart.

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.260
 What does it do?

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.660
 - In Japan, it's a traditional therapy of heart disease

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.900
 to even sick heart patients to sit for 15 or 20 minutes

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.940
 in an infrared sauna, then lie down and rest and hydrate

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.260
 for about half an hour.

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:29.380
 They call it WAON, W-A-O-N, it means soothing heat.

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:31.460
 And they've done research studies, like 30 of them,

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:33.380
 in humans, anti-ages your arteries

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.700
 and improves the strength of your heart

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:38.820
 and it may actually prolong survival in sick heart patients.

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:41.260
 Anybody can just, again, go to the internet,

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:43.100
 read about infrared sauna heart disease

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:44.540
 or put my name there 'cause I've written

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:46.020
 many articles about it.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:49.220
 Now there's data coming out of Sweden and Finland

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.140
 'cause they've published some amazing data

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.540
 that number of times a week you're in a sauna,

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:56.580
 number of minutes each time, you can just track out

00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.100
 how long you're gonna live.

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:01.380
 So very powerful therapy by being in,

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:03.540
 my favorite is an infrared sauna.

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:06.220
 - And our favorite is the RelaxFar Infrared Sauna

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.380
 that we've been promoting for, gosh,

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:12.420
 it's been almost 12, well, about 10, 12 years right now

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:15.940
 and I love mine and I think you'd enjoy this.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:20.940
 We promote these and are able to ship them

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.680
 all over the world.

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:25.180
 For some reason, the only place we haven't been able

00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:26.380
 to ship them is Germany.

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:31.020
 Now I choose to know exactly why that could possibly be

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:34.960
 but Germany doesn't seem to be crazy about 'em.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.460
 But everywhere else we can do it

00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:41.620
 and it's not as expensive as you might even imagine

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:43.900
 because other than the United States,

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:47.100
 they're shipped from a medical university in Taiwan

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:51.540
 and so they go right from there with the proper plug.

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:55.000
 So to get the price, the best price ever

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.000
 is just email me, patrick@oneradionetwork.com

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.200
 if you live outside.

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:06.200
 Now if you're in the lower 48, it's $1,195

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:09.620
 delivered, lower 48, $1,195.

00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:17.440
 So just email me, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.440
 (keyboard clicking)

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:24.240
 (upbeat music)

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.700
 - We are listener supported, One Radio Network.

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:39.600
 - Previously, we talked with Brandon Amelani

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.240
 about his Blue Shield product

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.040
 to protect against EMFs in your home.

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.160
 - The more connected we are,

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.400
 the more electromagnetic radiation we're gonna have.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.200
 So years ago, I'd play with Q-Links

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.640
 and just anything I can get my hands on

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.040
 that whether I felt it working or not,

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.240
 I just wanted some kind of leverage

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.760
 against electromagnetic radiation in those frequencies

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.600
 and how they affect the cellular biology.

00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.920
 But then when I met Mark

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.040
 and started really getting deep to his technology

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.640
 and really looking at the microprocessing technology,

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.160
 I've never found any EMF company

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:08.720
 that would not only to test on

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.480
 not only human blood and urine analysis,

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.860
 but also on animals,

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.480
 which totally weeds out the idea of placebo effect.

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:17.340
 I mean, the fact that you can plug these devices

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:19.120
 into a chicken farm, a factory farm

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.640
 for about 15,000 laying hens,

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.500
 and all of a sudden the mortality rate,

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:27.080
 which is averages from 60 to 150 deaths per month,

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.480
 it goes down to zero.

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.980
 I mean, it's pretty profound that a little device,

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.880
 a little energy device could actually like

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.720
 create such a harmony and balance within the environment

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:38.200
 to where claustrophobic chickens

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.400
 that are crammed in together actually get along better

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.360
 and actually feel better.

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.000
 And the biological markers are improved

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.240
 over that one year study.

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.320
 - There's quite a bit of science

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:48.600
 with this Blue Shield product.

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.400
 You can see the ad on the front page.

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:55.120
 Promo code OneRadio will get you a 10% discount.

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.660
 This works on the cells in the body.

00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:58.940
 Very cool technology.

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:02.680
 Front page, BlueShield, oneradionetwork.com.

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.080
 (upbeat music)

00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:06.060
 - Know the source.

00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:08.240
 OneRadionetwork.com.

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:12.160
 - Dr. Ray Peet, it is ray, drraypeet.com.

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.780
 Oh, just raypeet.com.

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:15.440
 Again, grab his newsletter.

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.280
 It's a great one.

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.360
 Every couple of months,

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.600
 it's not very, very, very cost effective.

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:22.960
 He just kind of gets it out there for you.

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:27.800
 It's raypeetsnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.840
 raypeetsnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:35.840
 As you know, Dr. Peet, we had quite the frigid,

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:39.580
 you know, two weeks here about a month ago.

00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:43.760
 And some of the people I talked to at the farmer's market,

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:47.440
 the man lost almost all of his pigs

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.760
 because they just couldn't take it.

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.720
 Isn't that amazing?

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:51.880
 Wow, man.

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:57.800
 - Yeah, when it's cold enough to lower your body temperature

00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:02.920
 that turns on improper inflammatory signals.

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:08.000
 And so it's at least as bad as having

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 a terrible viral infection,

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:15.360
 the activation of inflammation comes on

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.240
 when your energy is too low.

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:21.240
 So it doesn't matter whether it's from a poison

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.880
 or environmental chilling.

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:25.840
 - It doesn't matter.

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.640
 So, but there's a lot of people that argue

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.040
 like Wim Hof and others,

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:37.280
 that cold water or showers or being out in the cold

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:41.360
 could actually make one stronger, no?

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:46.360
 - It's your internal focusing of your metabolism.

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:54.000
 The nervous system has to essentially intend

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.040
 to increase your metabolic rate.

00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:01.720
 And you can keep your temperature up

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:06.720
 with the right attention.

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:11.400
 But the water that he can tolerate

00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.800
 would very quickly kill a lot of people

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.520
 by lowering their temperature.

00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.960
 - Very interesting.

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:21.080
 So let's get to some emails here, Dr. Pete,

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.200
 before we let you go.

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:26.480
 This one about aluminum.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.640
 Wants to know, let's see if I can grab it here.

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.480
 I lost it for a minute.

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.520
 Oh, most perspirants contain aluminum.

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:36.960
 Are there any safe antiperspirants?

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:41.360
 And does the aluminum in the ones that do have it

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.760
 detrimental to our health?

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:48.680
 - The function of the aluminum is to kill

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:53.960
 and harden the sweat glands.

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:57.600
 So it's killing the cells in your skin

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.200
 so that they can't function.

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:06.760
 I don't know of any skin studies of aluminum absorption,

00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.840
 but the metals that have been studied,

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.320
 like copper solution applied to the skin,

00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:17.240
 it immediately starts showing up in your bloodstream.

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:21.600
 So I don't think it's safe to assume

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:25.400
 that just because the aluminum is sticking

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:28.960
 to your sweat glands in the process of killing them,

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:31.160
 I don't think you can assume that that means

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:34.160
 that some of it isn't getting in your bloodstream.

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:39.000
 - Some people argue that we, many of us are low,

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.400
 many humans are low on copper.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.400
 Have you ever seen any evidence of that?

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.640
 Low on copper?

00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:51.200
 - Yeah, the ratio between copper and iron

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:55.000
 and a couple of other minerals is very clear

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000
 so that if your diet has too much molybdenum, for example,

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:05.080
 or iron, that will give you a copper deficiency.

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:08.400
 And if you're under prolonged stress,

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:14.500
 mercury or aluminum or many other stresses

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.900
 that increase your cortisol will cause you

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:22.900
 to produce a protein defensively that binds heavy metals

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:28.840
 and will carry mercury and lead and aluminum

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.120
 out of your body.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:35.120
 But in the process, that protein binds a lot of copper.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.720
 And so whenever you're under stress,

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.720
 you're tending to lose copper faster than you could.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:48.600
 And that's probably why stress, extreme stress,

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:54.280
 can sometimes cause sudden loss of pigment

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.640
 in your skin and hair.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.680
 - Hair, wow.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:02.000
 So that just leads more kind of grist for the mill,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.060
 this idea of when we worry and get anxious

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:09.440
 or whatever it is, fear that it's detrimental to our health.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.080
 And physiologically, we can see that this is what goes on.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:13.920
 We know it.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.400
 - Yeah, that one protein is just one example.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.640
 - Yeah, just one, right, just one.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.520
 This is from Terry.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.160
 He's in Boise, Idaho up there with a buffalo roam,

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.040
 or used to.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:30.040
 Repeat, is the dark ferrichlorogenic acid

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:36.000
 in boiled potatoes unhealthy?

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.240
 How do you say that word, ferrichloric?

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.720
 Boiled potatoes unhealthy.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.080
 - The green stuff on potatoes.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.920
 - Is that what it is, the green stuff?

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.160
 - Yeah, if the skin has turned green

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:58.160
 from exposure to light, yeah, that's pretty toxic.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.720
 It should be trimmed off.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:05.280
 - Now when we boil potatoes, those are digestibles, right?

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.120
 As long as we boil them pretty good?

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:11.640
 - Yeah, and they're almost a perfect nutrient.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:15.160
 They don't have vitamin B12,

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:20.160
 or the animal form of vitamin A.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.280
 Otherwise, they're an extremely balanced food.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.400
 They don't contain much protein as such,

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.720
 but they contain the precursors

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.440
 that our body needs to make protein.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.880
 So it turns out that people,

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:44.200
 there are cultures that have pork once a year for a week,

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.840
 and the rest of the year they want potatoes.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.040
 - They want potatoes.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.440
 You know, my mom tells a story

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.920
 that during the Depression,

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.920
 and that's about all they really ate was the potatoes.

01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.640
 - Yeah, the poor Irish were, for a long time,

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:05.200
 living on mainly potato diet,

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:10.200
 and so when potato blight developed,

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.360
 and they lost their potato crops,

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.840
 that was when the famine came on,

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:19.840
 because everyone was counting on abundant potatoes.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:22.120
 - There's so many different kinds.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.240
 We can get different colored ones,

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.240
 purple ones now at the Hippie Food Store,

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.200
 and gold, and have you,

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:34.200
 are there any that are better for us than others?

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.560
 - Those chemicals can be beneficial,

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.760
 but I've found them to be extremely hard to digest.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.760
 A lot of people have trouble eating purple potatoes.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:51.200
 The Yukon Gold, because of the high carotene content.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.040
 - High carotene.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.800
 - Yeah, carotene is the precursor to vitamin A,

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:02.800
 but if you are short on vitamin B12 or thyroid hormone,

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.440
 you don't convert carotene very well,

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.040
 and it builds up in the body

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:11.480
 and blocks the function of thyroid hormone,

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.320
 and then blocks the steroid production,

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:17.360
 like blocking progesterone.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.200
 So you don't want to overdo

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.760
 the yellow and orange vegetables.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.240
 - How about the little red potatoes,

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.840
 and the bakers would be the best choice for potatoes?

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:30.880
 If you're gonna like--

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:36.760
 - The white flesh is the easiest to digest

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.240
 when it's well baked or well boiled.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.680
 - The white flesh.

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.680
 - And so not necessarily,

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:45.960
 it doesn't matter about the red or the baker potato,

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.000
 'cause they both have white flesh, right?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.560
 - Yeah, the outside, the skin color doesn't matter.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:55.960
 - And so potatoes and carrots are squashed with butter.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.600
 It's a pretty good meal.

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.040
 - Oh, yeah, very good.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.440
 - It's better to cook 'em.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.360
 Can you cook 'em together?

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.920
 I guess you got the carrots and potatoes last night together.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.880
 Works pretty well.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.040
 - Yeah, just as long.

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:12.680
 Carrot juice is a way that people often poison themselves

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.760
 getting too much carotene.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:19.560
 But carrots and squashes,

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:24.560
 even though they contain carotene and related things,

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:29.080
 they have lots of good nutrients and other functions.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:33.240
 - Here's an email from Mohamed.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.200
 He's in Seattle.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.920
 This is a question for Dr. Pete when he comes on the show.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.440
 I met with some friends who got the vaccine

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.400
 in the last week and know that there's a possibility

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.160
 that some of the particles from the vaccine

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:49.680
 can potentially be in my body shedding.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.280
 Is there anything I can do to detox this

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:54.360
 out of my sister system?

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.640
 I don't really plan on getting it myself,

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.560
 but I know lots of people,

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.200
 I'll be around family, friends, and coworkers

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.200
 will want to stay safe as possible.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.620
 So do these things can shed bad stuff?

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:09.120
 These injectable?

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:13.080
 - There is some evidence of that.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:17.360
 It hasn't been studied enough to be sure what's going on,

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:21.520
 but it's always protective to make sure

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:26.520
 that your vitamin D and calcium intakes are good.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:31.920
 Vitamin D is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent,

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:36.320
 and that function is supported by making sure

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.960
 that you have a lot of calcium in your diet

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:40.480
 relative to phosphate.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:45.760
 The phosphate-rich foods are meat, fish,

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.200
 and the legumes and grains.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:54.200
 But people who eat too many beans in proportion

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:59.400
 to leafy greens and milk and cheese

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:04.420
 are likely to have a lot of inflammation-related problems.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.540
 - So that's why you're a fan of milk and cheese,

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.540
 a good food in your opinion, your experience.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:16.460
 - Yeah, many metabolic activating effects,

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:19.580
 not just the high calcium content,

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:24.580
 but several other things that activate your metabolic rate

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:27.420
 and support your thyroid function

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:32.420
 so that you don't get into the stress inflammatory states.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:37.900
 - Any idea where all of this anti-stuff

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:46.620
 on milk and dairy products come from?

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:53.700
 - Probably many psychological things,

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:58.700
 like for some reason, the medical world

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.560
 starting in the 1930s had a great phobia of breasts,

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:10.800
 and they didn't want women breastfeeding their babies,

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:15.800
 and they trained women to use artificial formulas.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:22.840
 I think there's a psychiatric motivation there,

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:29.160
 fear of women and children.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.000
 Having actual skin contact to breastfeed.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.040
 I've known people who extended that

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:45.600
 to have all kinds of strange doctrines

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:50.060
 associated with milk.

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:56.120
 The theories have been developed to explain

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.320
 why people shouldn't breastfeed

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:04.320
 and why they shouldn't drink milk after infancy,

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:09.840
 but none of it was based on actual studies

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:13.200
 of what happens when people or animals

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:16.840
 drink milk as part of their diet.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.520
 - This is a great question that ties right in.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.920
 This is from Trent.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.360
 Some people advocate if you're doing raw milk

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.120
 regardless of goat or cow or whatever,

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.440
 that we boil it before drinking.

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.280
 Does Dr. Peete have an opinion about this?

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:37.340
 - If you think your cow might have a disease,

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:43.280
 or if the person doing the milking didn't know how to do it

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:49.720
 and let bits of dandruff and manure and junk get in the milk,

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.400
 yeah, bringing it to a boil

01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:58.400
 or at least a sterilizing temperature of 160 or so degrees.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.080
 - Would there be a difference

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.080
 between that pasteurization temperature of 160

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.640
 or boiling 160 might do it?

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:11.920
 - A little bit of difference, but it isn't serious.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.520
 - So maybe, excuse me,

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.040
 maybe that's where it all comes from

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.400
 and the idea from Ayurvedic medicine,

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.720
 which is centered in India,

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.400
 where this third world country,

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.560
 which is more the sanitation,

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:28.280
 maybe that's where the milk boiling thing comes from.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.120
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.120
 I've bought milk coming in a big bowl or something

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:40.720
 and found bits of manure sedimented to the bottom.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.080
 - Okay.

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.360
 Does Ray Peete have an opinion

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.160
 regarding the aminoacetal carnitine's ability

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.440
 to slower the shortening rate of telomeres,

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:55.400
 excuse me, resulting in life extension,

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.760
 as I had to cough there, as well as better health.

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.320
 Is there a danger of consuming

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.280
 two grams of L-carnitine per day?

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:09.200
 - I've never seen any studies on its toxicity,

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.520
 but a lot of things will change the rate

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.120
 of telomere shortening.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:22.120
 But I don't think of the telomere

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:26.360
 as such a great indicator of aging.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:31.360
 Some very old people have good, strong telomeres.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:37.440
 Some people in their 20s already have very short telomeres,

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.520
 but their health hasn't suffered.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:45.600
 - So this telomere measuring thing to get your biological age

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:50.320
 could all just be one of those passing fancies

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.600
 that won't be around very long?

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:56.360
 - Well, it might be around for a long time.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:01.920
 I think who was responsible for it

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:07.960
 was culturing in the 1960s.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.200
 He was growing cells in culture,

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:16.200
 and noticed that after, I think it was about 50 passages

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:24.880
 in culture, 50 cell divisions, that they died out,

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:30.360
 and that that was preceded by a shortening of the telomere.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:35.920
 But he basically was doing a totally unbiological thing.

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:40.000
 A totally unbiological way of culturing

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.920
 with a buildup of lactic acid,

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.440
 which accelerates the aging and inflammatory processes,

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:50.760
 and in itself will shorten the telomeres.

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:55.480
 So it's all based on a terrible,

01:12:55.480 --> 01:13:00.480
 a non-scientific science, so-called science.

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:02.480
 - So-called science, yeah.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:06.320
 Ray Peet is with us on the third Monday of every month,

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.040
 and it's March 15th, we're live here.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.120
 This is from WC, Dr. Peet in Chattanooga, Tennessee,

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:12.960
 great part of the country.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:16.480
 My wife has a slow-growing brain tumor

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:19.520
 that's moving towards the optic part of the brain,

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.920
 and it may need to be removed before loss of vision.

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.000
 I understand you're not a brain surgeon, of course,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.240
 and can't give medical advice,

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:30.760
 but can you give your opinion on how this may have

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.720
 originated and how to slow its growth?

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:39.120
 - It depends greatly on what tissue it started from.

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.480
 Mentioning the optic nerve suggests it might have originated

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.840
 in or near the pituitary gland,

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:51.120
 and many of those tumors are

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:55.480
 curable by a chemical,

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.000
 bromocryptin or cabergoline

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.840
 are two of the chemicals that have been used

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.680
 to shrink pituitary tumors,

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:09.680
 and those tumors became extremely common

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:13.760
 after the birth control pill was introduced,

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:18.760
 so they're basically produced by an excess of estrogen.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:23.160
 And in general, tumors,

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.200
 even so-called malignant tumors,

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:32.200
 are restrained to some degree

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:37.080
 by aspirin and other anti-inflammatory things.

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:42.080
 Even antihistamines have a very basic

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:46.280
 anti-tumor effect, antiserotonin agents,

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:51.280
 because histamine and serotonin are tumor promoters.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:55.920
 - I've known people who've been diagnosed with a tumor,

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:59.720
 albeit small, in the brain and have just left it alone,

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.320
 have never been bothered by it,

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.360
 and do you think something like that,

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.880
 just with more anti-inflammatory foods and things,

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:10.440
 it will just dissipate or?

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.920
 - Yeah, I think,

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:21.520
 I think it was an English person who did the first study

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.320
 doing autopsies.

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:28.320
 He found that everyone by the age of 50 could,

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:32.520
 when he looked through their tissues,

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:36.480
 he found 100% of people 50 years old or more

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:41.040
 who had diagnosable cancer tissue in their bodies,

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:46.040
 and since 100% of living people in their 50s

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:49.200
 don't suffer from cancer,

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:53.760
 what that obviously means is that for most people,

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.960
 the majority of people,

01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:00.960
 the presence of cancer that a surgeon can prove is cancerous

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:07.800
 if it happens to be biopsied and studied,

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.680
 the presence of cancer in the body for most people

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:13.200
 isn't going to kill them.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.920
 - In your opinion, it's just not a problem,

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.760
 just leave it alone?

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.680
 - Yeah, that was finally put into practice

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.860
 in the case of prostate cancer.

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:29.120
 In the 80s, the prostate-specific antigen was discovered,

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.280
 and they started using it to diagnose

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.160
 whether a person had prostate cancer,

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.160
 and the standard treatment at that time

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.960
 was high doses of estrogen,

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:47.040
 and high doses of estrogen are not good for your health,

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:52.040
 but that was starting around 1940s,

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:56.160
 that was a standard treatment for everyone.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:01.160
 And so when the PSA test diagnosed many, many more people

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:06.000
 as having prostate cancer,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.120
 the treatment increased,

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:15.120
 and the mortality had a great surge in the early 90s.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:19.720
 More people were dying from prostate cancer very suddenly,

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:25.440
 and they realized that the treatment

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.440
 was what was killing most of the people.

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.040
 - Because they were increasing the estrogen,

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.120
 which was making matters worse.

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:36.040
 - Yeah, and someone did the survey

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:41.040
 at a convention of specialists in the prostate,

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:43.440
 and asked them what they would do

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.040
 if they were diagnosed with prostate cancer.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:51.000
 And most of them said they would do nothing,

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.640
 because they had seen the effects of their treatments.

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.640
 But they went on giving the treatment to their patients,

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.640
 but they said they wouldn't do it themselves.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:17:59.720
 - Fascinating.

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:04.400
 - And growing from that bit of publicity in the 90s,

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.320
 by the start of this century,

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:10.720
 the idea of watchful waiting for prostate cancer,

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:15.720
 that they acknowledged that you're going

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:19.940
 to almost certainly die from something else

01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:24.320
 before the prostate cancer will kill most people.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:29.320
 So just watching it became a better treatment,

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:34.040
 and for sure better than giving estrogen.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:36.080
 - Jacqueline is in Pennsylvania.

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:39.640
 I often get severe headaches during menstruation.

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.080
 Does Dr. Pete have any reasons

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:45.060
 for the cause and cure of this?

01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:51.360
 - Yeah, I used to have migraines frequently,

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.560
 right from childhood.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:57.240
 And after I had been working with progesterone

01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:02.240
 for a few years, I happened to have a concentrated solution

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:08.080
 of progesterone and vitamin E as a headache was coming on.

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:13.200
 And I took a gob of that, and within seconds,

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:18.120
 the visual effects subsided and the pain,

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:23.120
 and that got me interested in the vascular effect

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:32.000
 of a high estrogen and low progesterone.

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.760
 The blood sugar and salt balance are governed

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:43.120
 by estrogen and progesterone balance.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:48.120
 And so the changing hormones,

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:53.800
 especially at the end of menstruation

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.880
 when your progesterone has crashed,

01:19:55.880 --> 01:20:01.840
 then that's when you're very susceptible to migraines.

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:07.920
 And just eating a tremendous amount of sugar,

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:13.160
 I found, would block the development of a migraine.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:21.800
 Essentially, the same thing is happening

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:26.800
 when you raise your blood sugar strongly

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:30.920
 or raise your progesterone concentration

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.960
 in your blood suddenly.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:39.040
 The inflammatory signals are blocked

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:42.680
 when you have a stabilizing factor,

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:46.080
 which could be sugar or progesterone,

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.200
 or aspirin and other things help,

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:53.480
 but sugar and progesterone are the most powerful

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.920
 stabilizing factors.

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.720
 - So Jacqueline could have a little bit of ice cream

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:59.600
 when her period is coming on, some ice cream, right?

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.800
 Orange juice, right?

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:04.440
 - I told a nutrition class once

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.520
 that I found a quart of ice cream if I could eat it

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:12.320
 before the peak of the headache

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.160
 would block the rest of the headache.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.600
 One woman in the class giggled and said

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:20.040
 she had discovered the same thing,

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.560
 except it took a gallon.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.000
 - That's great.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.120
 Now there's also, and I know you like a little product,

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:30.640
 and I think it's called Progest-Ease, is that correct?

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.240
 - Yeah, that's one I--

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.640
 - You developed.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.560
 - Yeah, when I was working on it,

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.160
 I tested it on myself twice for migraines,

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:44.120
 and both times within about two minutes,

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.720
 it was all over.

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:52.440
 So then I met a woman with multiple sclerosis

01:21:52.440 --> 01:22:00.200
 and another one with an ocular disease

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:03.280
 ocular optic nerve condition

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:06.600
 that was related to multiple sclerosis.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:09.360
 And both of those women,

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:13.080
 one woman was giving it by injections

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:17.200
 and basically cured herself.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:21.480
 She came to my endocrinology class.

01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:25.000
 She had been bedridden for months and months,

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.160
 but when she discovered progesterone,

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.480
 she drove to Portland,

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:36.760
 walked up, I think it was three flights to my classroom,

01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:41.640
 and lectured for an hour on the use of progesterone.

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:46.440
 Absolute strong health just by the use of progesterone.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:47.280
 - Interesting.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:51.160
 Where can our listeners get this Progest-Ease

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:53.300
 that you developed, helped develop?

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.920
 - Yeah, Kenogen has been making it for decades.

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:01.600
 - Kenogen, how do you spell that?

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.880
 - K-E-N-O-G-E-N.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:04.720
 - Yeah.

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:09.720
 - And their email is kenogen@gmail.com.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:17.160
 - Okay, and then you just need a couple drops of that,

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.440
 and so Jacqueline could try some of this

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.560
 when her period is coming on.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:24.520
 - Well, yeah, that's a first aid,

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:28.520
 but the reason progesterone gets too low

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.600
 and blood sugar gets too low

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:35.600
 is almost always a nutritional and thyroid-related problem.

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:40.560
 So you should check your thyroid and vitamin D

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:45.560
 and calcium intake, and usually that will take care of it.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:48.240
 - Yeah, and she lives up in Pennsylvania,

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:51.960
 so it could especially be exacerbated during the winter

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.800
 when there's not a lot of sun.

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.280
 - Yeah. - Right, yeah.

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.680
 This is Thomas in Sweden,

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.920
 and it goes exactly along their lines

01:23:58.920 --> 01:23:59.960
 where we're talking right now.

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.920
 I wonder if Dr. Pete is aware of the work

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:06.640
 of Dr. D-Z-U-G-A-N, previously connected

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.600
 with life extension, curing migraines,

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.920
 oh, migraines too, and other chronic diseases

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:18.000
 with oral DHEA pregnenolone as well as testosterone,

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.360
 progesterone, and estrogen in the forms of creams.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.460
 Living in Sweden, I can barely get my hands

01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:27.920
 on DHEA and pregnenolone, and so I wonder

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:30.640
 if, done right, this might be enough

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:34.080
 to cure migraines for most people, myself included.

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:38.000
 Oh, very, very same genre of questioning here.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.080
 - Yeah, the ideal thing is to have

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:50.080
 such a good conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone,

01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:54.720
 and of pregnenolone to DHEA and progesterone,

01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:01.340
 that you don't have to resort to stress factors

01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:06.380
 such as cortisol, aldosterone, and estrogen.

01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:11.380
 Those are opposed by pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone,

01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:14.860
 and thyroid is the main factor

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:19.420
 for converting your cholesterol to those.

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:22.060
 So if your cholesterol is low,

01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:26.620
 besides tending to your thyroid,

01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:30.140
 you have to figure out how to get

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:32.940
 your cholesterol up to normal.

01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:37.160
 But usually, people with high cholesterol,

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.460
 when they supplement the right amount of thyroid,

01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:44.340
 the cholesterol comes down exactly as the thyroid

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:45.460
 takes effect.

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:47.600
 - Interesting, very good.

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.960
 This is from Jones.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.040
 If one were to forced to take a vaccine,

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:58.160
 would the J&J vaccine be the lesser of the two evils?

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:01.900
 What could one take to help offset the side effects

01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:03.640
 of the J&J vaccine?

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:05.080
 Johnson & Johnson, I guess.

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:11.400
 - Well, it contains the DNA that makes the spike protein,

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.240
 and I don't think the spike protein is--

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.040
 - That's not what we want, no.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:19.160
 - Yeah, you don't want a gene in your body

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:24.160
 for making this terrible pro-inflammation protein.

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:31.120
 I think it's the presence of the spike protein

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:35.920
 that is the danger in the long run.

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.280
 If you have the DNA for it,

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:43.120
 you can't be sure that that DNA isn't going to

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:45.840
 become part of your own repertoire.

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:50.840
 And then that would mean that every time you activated

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:55.400
 that gene, you would be making more of the spike protein.

01:26:55.400 --> 01:27:01.840
 And again, that spike protein andogen is producing

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:07.120
 antibodies to specialize for it,

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:10.700
 and so it's damaging the rest of your immune system.

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.760
 - So have you read anything that would support the idea

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:23.240
 that this Russian Sputnik so-called vaccine

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:26.740
 is a kinder, gentler vaccine?

01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:29.840
 More with the antibodies and not so much

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:32.120
 of the genetic nonsense?

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:35.640
 - No, I've heard that, but I haven't studied it

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:37.240
 enough to know.

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:39.440
 - Here's from CB, "I've read DNA is swapped

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.560
 between partners.

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:43.440
 If this is the case, can a vaccinated partner

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:46.360
 swap their altered DNA with a partner

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.880
 who has not been vaccinated?"

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:48.720
 Wow.

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:55.800
 - I think that is being supported by some evidence

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:58.760
 that just needs a lot more study.

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:03.760
 But for sure, a woman sampling her tissues

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:13.200
 and body fluids, but after death, brain tissue,

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:16.680
 for example, has been found.

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:21.680
 A woman's cells have taken up her male,

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:25.420
 her partner's DNA.

01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:31.680
 The semen is absorbed by the woman's tissues

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:36.520
 and become incorporated in all of the tissues

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.360
 of her body.

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:43.520
 So DNA from humans apparently has some good

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:48.320
 biological properties.

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:53.320
 The woman uses it in her process of reproduction.

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:58.560
 But stranger forms of DNA, like from algae,

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:04.520
 can also be found in the brain after you've eaten

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.560
 a slightly harmful food.

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:09.880
 - You've mentioned algae before.

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:13.080
 Are there any forms of algae, maybe fresh or something

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:14.680
 that are beneficial?

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:18.780
 Like there's one that they promoted for years

01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:22.440
 up near you, the aqua, you know which one I mean?

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:23.440
 - Yeah, the blue.

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.280
 - Blue-green, is that good stuff?

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:28.760
 - It's actually a kind of bacteria, I think,

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:30.760
 rather than real algae.

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:35.000
 But I think it's too dangerous.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.000
 And even the real algaes have irritating

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.360
 and toxic problem nutrients.

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:49.480
 Green plants in general have their defensive materials.

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:56.000
 So I think it's better to let animals with rumens

01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:02.920
 process plant material before it's taken in.

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:07.440
 If you're going to eat anything green,

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.520
 you should be sure that you know

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.280
 what the processing is doing.

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:19.160
 Like a very long cooking of green leaves

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:22.080
 makes some of the toxins break down.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:27.080
 But still you're going to get some anti-nutrient factors.

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:29.320
 If you eat too many vegetables.

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:32.840
 - So that's why we want to cook kale well.

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:33.880
 - Very well, yeah.

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:35.040
 - Very well.

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.920
 Final one for you, then you get to go play.

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:41.240
 Assuming that thyroid status is optimal

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.520
 or supplemental as necessary,

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:46.560
 what are the expected optimal blood cholesterol levels

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.180
 for different various age groups?

01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:56.240
 - Just the epidemiological information shows

01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:59.520
 that after the age of 50,

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:04.520
 if your cholesterol level is not above 200,

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:09.120
 your risk of having dementia is a lot higher.

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:15.240
 And so that's apparently because not only your thyroid

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:19.500
 tends to become less efficient with aging,

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:24.500
 but all of the enzymes involved in converting

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:29.840
 cholesterol to the good protective things like protesterone,

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:34.120
 all of those become less effective in older age.

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:39.120
 And so as you increase your blood cholesterol level

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:44.760
 at keeping those other things steady,

01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:49.000
 you're going to increase your level of pregnenolone

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.560
 and protesterone because cholesterol

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:56.400
 is very largely functioning as a precursor

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.520
 to those protective steroids.

01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:02.680
 - So that's why a higher 180, 190, 200,

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:05.720
 pretty safe and happy levels for most folks.

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:08.960
 - Yeah, and over 50, 220, 230 is fine.

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:10.880
 - Oh, so I see, yeah.

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:14.560
 Yeah, Dr. Huggins, one of our longtime friends,

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.860
 he used to, I think he even wrote a book, Dr. Peete,

01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:19.200
 called "225" and that was his favorite number.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.800
 He would test all these blood samples of people

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:25.080
 and he thought that the 225 was optimal for people.

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:26.740
 It's interesting, 225.

01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:30.780
 Well, Mr. Peete, it's such an honor to talk to you.

01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:31.720
 Thanks for being there.

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:34.280
 What are you going to do fun today, anything?

01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.600
 You painting a lot these days?

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:38.280
 - Oh, no, not much.

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:39.120
 - No?

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.760
 - But I'll be getting around to it.

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:42.600
 - Yeah.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.720
 - I haven't thought about today.

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:49.000
 I'm working on the newsletter on inflammation right now.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.240
 I'll probably be doing that.

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:55.400
 - And when does this newsletter come out on inflammation?

01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:00.160
 - Towards the end of this month or beginning of April.

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.640
 - And if you'd like to get Dr. Peete's newsletter,

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:06.200
 it's, let's see, is it Dr. Ray, I used to,

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.440
 I had it there for a minute,

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:09.600
 oh, Ray Peete's newsletter, plural, right?

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:12.440
 RayPeete'sNewsletter@gmail.com.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:13.280
 - Yeah.

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:14.120
 - Correct?

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:16.240
 All right, sir, again, thank you very much

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.160
 for being on the show.

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:18.560
 We appreciate it, thanks a lot.

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:19.720
 - Okay, thank you.

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.200
 - See you real soon, bye.

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:24.120
 - Dr. Ray Peete, Patrick Timpone,

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:27.880
 Ray, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:30.600
 Well, what a fun guy to talk to, huh?

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:34.880
 So again, we have a Show Me the Virus show

01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:37.920
 with Dr. Kaufman and Cowan,

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:40.320
 two of the people that are out there

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:42.640
 really talking about the germ theory.

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:46.520
 They're gonna be here Wednesday, two days from now,

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.600
 10 o'clock Central Time,

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:52.440
 so a great chance for you to ask them some good questions.

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.800
 Don't be shy, just dig right in,

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:58.480
 and if what they're saying is kinda crazy to you,

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:01.200
 but more and more people are,

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:05.160
 even Dr. Peete and Zach Bush and others are pretty close,

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:07.720
 pretty close to what they're saying.

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:11.320
 A few exceptions, but there's always different viewpoints

01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:13.960
 and different parameters.

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:15.640
 It's not black and white.

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:18.400
 So anyway, if you care to ask them a question,

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:20.600
 you can get your questions in now,

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:23.080
 patrick@oneradionetwork.com,

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:28.000
 patrick@oneradionetwork.com,

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.960
 and we will see you then on,

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:33.480
 well, we'll see you tomorrow morning, about 10 o'clock.

01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:36.440
 We're gonna talk to a fellow from the World Bank.

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:38.360
 That's right, the belly of the beast,

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:41.680
 people that are into globalism, fiat currencies,

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:46.120
 and we're gonna try to find out why they do what they do.

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:49.000
 (silence)

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
 That'll be fun.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.240
 Tomorrow morning, 10 o'clock Central Time.

01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:54.800
 I love you all very much.

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.280
 Thanks for your ongoing support.

01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:59.000
 It's just a great honor for me to be here

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.680
 and make a living doing this

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:04.320
 in my little studio up above my kitchen

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.600
 here in Dripping Springs, Texas.

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:07.520
 Let me know if I can help,

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:11.920
 patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.880
 So I love you,

01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:16.800
 and we'll see you tomorrow morning, Tuesday,

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:20.040
 the 16th of March at 10 o'clock.

01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:20.880
 Take care.

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:22.120
 May the blessings be.
