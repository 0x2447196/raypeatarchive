WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.760
 Okay, normally I would say Georgi Dinkov and Ray Peat, but we only have Ray today.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.440
 Georgi, hopefully he'll come and we'll work him into what's going on, but it's just going

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.000
 to be a chat between Ray and I. How are you, Ray?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Very good.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.560
 Okay, so immediately before we talked about your newsletter, I wanted to get into, I felt

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.960
 like I kind of approached the nutrition topic a little bit off center on the last episode.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.440
 I thought it was good, but I thought my questions to you were kind of holding you up like an

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.800
 authority and it wasn't conscious. I wasn't trying to do it, but I was unimpressed with

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.680
 my questions to you. So maybe, I don't know, is there anything you can think of that would

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.480
 kind of broaden the scope of what we were talking about last time in terms of approaching

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.600
 nutrition? And of course that will probably lead right into your new newsletter.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:08.240
 Well, nutrition is as complex and open and undefined as metaphysics or cosmology or anything.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.240
 It's a process of exploring and learning and figuring things out. And so it's never a closed

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.080
 book, never a finished subject.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.080
 What is the problem with authoritarianism in nutrition? Like if somebody says, "Oh, Ray

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.360
 Peat says to eat 100 grams of protein and 200 grams of carbohydrate," like what does

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.160
 that negate from the individual trying to figure things out?

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:38.360
 Everything is always changing and always individual and always changed by context. And so what's

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.800
 true for one person today, where they are will necessarily be somewhat different when

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.560
 they're in a different place doing different things. It's always looking at your problems

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:01.880
 immediately in your context and to understand those, it helps to look at your history, how

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.320
 you got to where you are and what you want to do to get beyond the present. So all the

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.440
 dimensions have to be flexible. And so your digestive system reflects the things you've

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:25.760
 done in the past. Your whole being is taking form, assimilating things you've experienced

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.280
 and intend to experience. So you have to think of yourself as an intended participant in

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.320
 everything, including your choices of foods.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.200
 Well, given how complex everything is and everything's a moving target, like how do

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.520
 you even approach the subject?

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:51.640
 With what you've been doing and how it has worked for you. If you've been living on sweet

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:59.440
 potatoes and pork fat and you're doing okay in the middle age, then you don't see much

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.040
 need for a change.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.280
 But what if somebody was grown up eating cereal and fruit snacks? What would...

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.880
 They probably wouldn't have grown up very much.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.840
 Oh no, that's me.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.040
 So would the context change if somebody's writing you an email and saying, "Hey Ray,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.320
 I have a low pulse rate, a low temperature, high cholesterol, constipation." Is that what

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.400
 makes the suggestions in context with what the person is explaining?

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.440
 Yeah. All those things point to hypometabolism, low thyroid function.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.920
 And then, okay, so if you're saying something like protein, carbohydrate, calcium, et cetera,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.600
 you're giving those facts to that person and then it's up to them, like we talked about

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.480
 last time, the creative act of conversation and then that person assimilating the info

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.080
 and trying to extract something out of it that means something to them in their life.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.880
 Yeah, because their digestive system is going to have its unique oddities and it might turn

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.840
 out that the high protein diet that would quickly cure someone if they already have

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.320
 a sensitivity to serotonin and tryptophan, for example, they might have to work into

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:23.280
 that very carefully with a diet emphasizing more gelatin than the highest quality proteins.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.520
 And then when somebody says, emails you and says, "I'm doing the Ray Peat diet," what

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.520
 is your... what do you think of that?

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.480
 First, I ask them what they're eating.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.720
 So you automatically assume that that was... so just to be completely honest here, so I

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.000
 told you that I don't like that term, and I used to edit it out of podcasts, but it

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 has gained a lot of traction. But you think even using that term, I'm not saying you think

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.560
 this, but it's probably kind of to really reduce your work into silly territory, saying

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.120
 something like Ray Peat diet, you think?

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.480
 Pretty much. From what I hear, people are eating on the Ray Peat diet. At least, it

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:17.160
 usually excludes eating a lot of bread and green salads and beans. But those are, I think,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.720
 a few of the things that people generally realize can be harmful.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.320
 Maybe you could critique my approach, but I feel like when I chat with a lot of people,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.880
 there's always diet stuff, but it almost seems like if they're talking to me, it's past the

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.360
 point of no return with dietary intervention. Is that a bad orientation to have? Because

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.400
 usually they'll have labs as well, and I think the person will generally be kind of at the

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.800
 end of the road. They'll have tried veganism or low carb or carnivore or et cetera, et

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.800
 cetera, et cetera.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.800
 And I'm almost inclined to suggest the vitamin D to read hypothyroidism, the unsuspected

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.040
 illness to get into thyroid and stuff. And of course, doing the dietary interventions.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.080
 But I don't know, could you say after 20 or 25 that a person is like, I'm sure you could

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.360
 say earlier, but that it's very hard to get the metabolic rate going just with food alone?

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:15.320
 Oh yeah. Almost everyone benefits from adding a little bit of thyroid. The human diet historically

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:23.200
 probably always included some supplemental animal thyroid, whether it came from chicken,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:33.440
 stew, or fish soup, or sausages, or even blood. There was always some supplement coming from

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:41.240
 their food. And since 1940, that has been legally banned from the American food supply

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.200
 and pretty much other industrialized countries imitating the US requiring slaughterhouses

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:56.320
 to take out the thyroid glands. And people generally just don't eat the blood. It's sort

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:04.040
 of a taboo. While countries that save the blood and make tacos out of it or something

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.920
 are getting a little bit of extra hormones of various types.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.680
 Something I've noticed, and I don't know if you feel the same, but there's something

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.840
 about thyroid that a lot of people don't feel comfortable with. They'll take progesterone

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.240
 or DHEA or pregnenolone, or they'll even be taking other supplements like ashwagandha

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.240
 or rhodiola or just you name it. But thyroid is a lot of crossing the line to a lot of

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.240
 people.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.800
 I think the drug companies and the doctors that have been educated under their influence

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:42.240
 are responsible for that. The same thing that caused the agriculture department to order

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:49.280
 slaughterhouses to remove it from the food supply. Broda Barnes tells some of the stories,

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:58.000
 for example, in the 1930s, he observed that thyroid deficiency, among other things, caused

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.160
 an extremely high rate of heart attacks and circulatory disease, infectious diseases,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:11.440
 circulatory diseases and cancer were the main killers in a hypothyroid population.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:18.160
 But when he started popularizing that, there was a reaction and JAMA published a story

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.280
 about a doctor who had given a patient who had just suffered a massive heart attack a

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:31.120
 supplement of, I think, two grains of Armour thyroid starting right off on a full standard

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:39.280
 dose rather than working into it over a period of weeks and the patient died. And so that

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:47.200
 created the propaganda that natural thyroid could kill you with a heart attack. And that

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:53.960
 sort of thing was amplified when the Synthroid, I think, was the first one on the market with

00:08:53.960 --> 00:09:03.360
 a synthetic thyroxine product. I was in junior high around that time and there were several

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:12.480
 fat kids and most of the kids already at that time were seeing doctors regularly and almost

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:19.040
 simultaneously two or three of my fat friends said that they didn't have a hormone problem,

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:27.520
 they were just gluttons. That had been taught to the doctors who taught it to their overweight

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:36.360
 patients. And that went with doctors ordering their patients to stop taking thyroid. If

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:43.800
 an old empirical doctor had recognized that people with chronic infections or obesity

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:53.600
 or any of the 30 or so classical symptoms of hypothyroid, if people had been doing well

00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:04.200
 taking Armour thyroid, they went to the modern update, the well-trained doctors told them

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.520
 to stop taking it because it was dangerous.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:13.400
 As I say, in obesity, is the part of the look of obesity just that accumulation of mucopolysaccharides?

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:25.280
 Yeah, usually it is. It's a mixture of Cushing's symptoms, high stress hormones of various

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:33.160
 sorts and they can go in the direction of high estrogen or high serotonin or high histamine,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:43.480
 high cortisol, high aldosterone, imbalance of the androgens, many different hormonal

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:51.080
 directions just because your thyroid is not giving you the energy to contextualize your

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.640
 physiology to round everything off.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.960
 I'm searching for it right now. I'm sure I will not be able to find it, but I feel like

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.720
 one of the most important things you've ever said that really helped me clarify my extremely

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.120
 blurry picture of physiology is you said when your thyroid is low, your pituitary doesn't

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.800
 have much to do and your ovaries don't have much to do either and all the glands in your

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.400
 body have an easy job when your thyroid is high.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.360
 I appreciated that so much because if you listen to other people in the health world,

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.860
 it's so ridiculously complicated to figure out, "Okay, where does LH and growth hormone

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:30.680
 and prolactin and FSH?" It's incomprehensible without a model that you've put together of

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.400
 the energy stress. When the energy is low, the activation of the stress systems happens.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:43.840
 I think it's helpful to have in mind a mental image of a libertarian world or an anarchist

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:49.400
 society in which everyone knows what to do and how to take care of themselves. That's

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:58.680
 when energy is abundant and your thyroid is good. When the well-distributed energy availability

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:07.480
 isn't there, then you have to look to be pushed to do what you're supposed to be doing. That's

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:14.680
 where the thyroid, the pituitary comes in. The pituitary is roused in proportion to how

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:21.320
 everything is failing. It pushes you this way and that way to make up for what you should

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:27.520
 be doing just on the basis of your cellular needs and cellular knowledge.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:33.640
 Little W.D. Denkla, you weren't kidding. I feel like you've integrated his work so well.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.120
 All the papers were perfectly in sync with what you were saying. I was really shocked

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.600
 when I got a hold of a couple of them.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:46.520
 Yeah, it's funny how he just disappeared from the world of knowledge.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:52.080
 He's sent to the backwoods maybe? What was it, Dave McCarron, the calcium hypertension

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.080
 dude?

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.080
 Yeah.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.360
 Let's take a small break here. Ray Peat is on the line with me. Georgi, I'm not sure

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:04.640
 where he is. I hope he's okay. Ray, your newsletter is available by email, Ray Peat's newsletter.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:10.440
 Yeah, this issue isn't quite ready. I sent you a draft of it, but I'm still working on

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.440
 it.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.560
 Awesome. People can subscribe to your newsletter by sending $28 to raypeats, with an S, newsletter

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.040
 at gmail.com. Is that right?

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.040
 Right.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.080
 Then they can send that same email address. They can send any of the titles of your books

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.040
 for that. We'll talk about Progesthe a little bit later, I think. You know what? We never

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:34.120
 talked about those videos surfacing on the back of a tiger. Did you think anything about

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.960
 those videos being released on YouTube?

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:45.720
 I haven't listened to the whole thing that you sent me. I've heard enough recording.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.880
 I thought they were good. A lot of people really were excited to see you in action.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:56.240
 I think that brings a different element to it. If that movie has done something good,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.040
 it's released those videos. Those were fun to listen to.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.120
 Then before we pass by this whole subject, I hope I'm not embarrassing you or anything,

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.920
 but I think people shouldn't eat things that damage them and should eat things that taste

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.400
 good and that provide the essential nutrients while making them feel good and function well.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:17.960
 Is that a diet? Is there anything left to speak about that in such an authoritarian

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:24.640
 nutrition world? Even your stupid apprentice is misinterpreting things as well. Any room

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.640
 to clarify?

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:38.640
 I'm okay with that as a statement that what tastes good is very important. Your impulses,

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:47.320
 your needs very often are responsible for what you're eating. But if you're supplied

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:55.000
 with something not quite like what you need, then your taste might cause you to do something

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:08.360
 like overeating on sugar or salt. Your cravings are biologically logical, but if the way you

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:16.960
 are led to satisfy your cravings is abnormal, then your body might be tricked into malfunctioning

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:23.160
 even though it's following its impulses. When your thyroid function is low, your blood

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:31.560
 sugar becomes unstable, and so you tend to crave sweets and alternatively salt, which

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:42.040
 helps you to use the glucose efficiently. But if you're mixed foods that would supply

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:50.240
 those needs, if they're very distorted, then you might not correct the problem by following

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:58.640
 your instincts. So you have to use your other perceptions and thought processes to figure

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.840
 out just what it is your body is telling you to do.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.760
 What was that H.G. Wells quote? It's like, "Nature never appeals to intellect unless

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:12.280
 intuition fails." Or what was it? Something else fails? Your instincts? Instincts fail.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.200
 Just before we get comments, I don't think I'm stupid. I'm just joking, everybody.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:21.260
 Okay. But one thing is, could somebody be in such a bad place that their orienting reflex

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:27.240
 and intuition is just so jaded and blurry that, for lack of a better word, or suggesting

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.400
 something to them is... Would that still be kind of a bad situation? How would you approach

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.880
 something like that?

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:42.280
 People tend to be immersed in the forces of their authoritarian surroundings. The culture

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:47.800
 that they have integrated is telling them to do certain things, like go to the doctor

00:16:47.800 --> 00:17:00.480
 if you feel sick. If your body doesn't play a role in those cultural instructions, then

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:08.400
 you'll go to the doctor, go to your job, maybe go to church, do whatever the culture prescribes,

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:19.000
 and ignore what your body is telling you. But anyone can start to listen to themselves.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.640
 When they are mentally hearing instructions, a conscience telling them what they should

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:31.320
 be doing, if they listen carefully, they'll be able to detect the source of where that

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:40.920
 instruction is coming from. The guru, I don't know what he was officially called, but George

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:51.960
 Gurdjieff, his basic principle was "Remember yourself." That really meant looking at what

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:59.720
 your body impulses are doing and put that into conjunction with what your environment

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:08.400
 is ordering you to do. Like you call up an image of who is speaking the instructions

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:16.520
 to you, and then check how that image and set of instructions goes with your heart plexus

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:24.960
 and your solar plexus, and check out what it does to your body. Usually you feel a shrinking,

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:30.040
 compressed feeling in your body when you hear those conscience voices speaking to you.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:36.480
 I feel the opposite when I eat a churmoya. You said G.I. Gurdjieff, right? Is that the

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.480
 guru?

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.480
 Yeah.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.960
 He has a quote, "Without self-knowledge, without understanding the working and functions

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.780
 of his machine, man cannot be free and he cannot govern himself, and he will always

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:48.780
 remain a slave."

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.780
 Yeah, that's pretty solid.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:56.820
 Okay, great stuff. I'm a little bit, is trepidatious the right word, to get into your

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:02.760
 newsletter because it's such a dense newsletter. I'd love to be able to summarize it, but

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:07.980
 I wouldn't do it justice. I guess, what was your motivation for writing it specifically?

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:20.020
 It was sort of a shotgun approach to explaining a general approach. Like a mosaic, you put

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:28.900
 down a lot of the material that is going to make up the image, and you hope that when

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:37.060
 you get enough of the material together, you'll recognize what adds up, the general meaning.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:45.980
 So it's just a collection of these last 120 years, or 200 years actually, of observations

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:54.460
 about how organisms work and how they might work. And then looking at the very clear experiments,

00:19:54.460 --> 00:20:00.740
 showing definitely that they don't work in certain ways and do work in other ways that

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:09.580
 have been ignored, such as the purpose and intentionality of single-celled organisms

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:16.540
 all the way down to bacteria, making decisions and planning and changing their behavior according

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:25.060
 to what they perceive the environment to require. If bacteria can do it, why can't a human brain

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:35.900
 cell do something at least partly as competent as that? I think the culture has created partly

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:45.300
 to instill a helpless attitude in the public, has created this doctrine that our brain cells

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:55.620
 are among the stupidest of all parts of creation. They can only signal by on and off information,

00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:05.020
 yes or no, nothing, approaching the infinite judgment ability that bacteria or planaria

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.340
 or amoebas display.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:13.680
 Something that reminded me of something is like, everybody has their desired outcome

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:18.860
 for society or how we should organize ourselves, but the gist I get from you is that that hasn't

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.740
 even been an optimal way of doing that, hasn't even been approached, or maybe it has slightly

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:28.220
 with Marxism or something, but like an environment that actually supported our physiology or

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.700
 biology or whatever hasn't even been broached yet.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:43.820
 Yeah, that's someone like Kropotkin put together biology and culture and politics into a single

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:44.820
 picture.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.220
 And there's something you mentioned in this article that I haven't thought about for a

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:52.620
 long time is the primary, how do you say that, psyllium? And that's like a little, you call

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.540
 it sensing organelle or something on the cell?

00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:04.660
 Yeah, like our retinal cells have this little finger tip, it's like a psyllium except it

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:15.260
 doesn't wiggle. It internally resonates with what's impinging upon it, and that resonance

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:23.180
 is made available to the connecting nervous system. Same with the ear or the olfactory

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:29.860
 nerves or the touch movement detectors all through the body. Each brain cell even has

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:36.860
 its own little antenna tuning it into the environmental conditions.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.460
 Okay, so we're going to pause really quickly. Ray, I'm actually going to hang up on you.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.700
 I'm going to call Georgi, then I'm going to call you back, and I'm going to pause the

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.660
 screen everybody. And so you guys will be hearing music and we'll get Georgi on the

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.660
 line. Is that okay, Ray?

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.660
 Okay.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.980
 Okay, so I'll call you back in one or like two minutes or so. Okay.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:54.980
 Okay.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.020
 Okay. Bye, Ray. Okay, hang on everybody. Okay, Georgi, we're live. Ray, we're live. Okay.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:03.740
 So there's Georgi. Everybody, this was probably my mistake. And so apologies to Georgi, I

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:08.180
 think I told you the wrong time. Okay. So Georgi, we were going through, first we kind

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.820
 of talked about nutrition. We got all that out of my system, which I need to talk about.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.540
 And then we're now we're going through Ray's newsletter. We just talked about the cilium,

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:21.620
 the sensing organelle of the cell. And Ray, what are some of the other critical things

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.180
 in this newsletter that you feel like are very important?

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:32.340
 That's the theme that comes back over and over is the conscious purpose of each of the

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:41.020
 component cells. Like the hologram idea is that conscious memories are not localized

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:50.740
 in any part of the tissue, but people like Carl Preblum was the outstanding figure in

00:23:50.740 --> 00:24:00.260
 that line of thinking that the cortex through a network of synapses is able to make a hologram

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:11.980
 that records awareness images in a non-localized hologram manner. And that is still limited

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:23.060
 by the discrete nature of synaptic individual action, even though the pattern imposed on

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:31.060
 that network of synaptic conditions or states, even though that's holographic, the underlying

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:40.860
 substance of the brain function that Preblum advocated was still the old-fashioned behaviorist

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:50.100
 mechanical on/off nerve cell is nothing but a switch-like conveyor of yes or no information

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:59.740
 rather than something transmitting the complex image-like perceptions of each of the cells,

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:08.140
 receptor cells or the nerve cells themselves containing a primary cilium in addition to

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:18.420
 messages they're getting from other nerve cells. So it's trying to show that everything

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:29.180
 that denies the complete participation of every cell in our conscious purposeful activity,

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:35.740
 everything that denies that is based on an arbitrary assumption, which ultimately is

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:41.460
 a false assumption that leads to behaviorism and mechanism and reductionism.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:47.180
 I have a question about holograms. Can a group of organisms, regardless of species, can sort

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:51.340
 of band together and form a super hologram that combines their consciousness into sort

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.860
 of like the collective consciousness that we all talk about?

00:25:54.860 --> 00:26:03.580
 Yeah, if they are sensitive and care to tune in to their surroundings, if they put their

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:10.500
 primary cilium in contact with the draining cytoplasm, then they should be able to pick

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.700
 up the whole worldview and metaphysics of whoever they're touching.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.940
 Do you think that may explain the ancestral memories and people having visions and contacts

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:24.980
 with people that have been dead for a long time? Basically, they're like re-materializing

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.740
 that portion of that collective consciousness.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:37.980
 Yeah, I think it's important not to rule out anything, not to assume limits to awareness

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.380
 that aren't based on some kind of real evidence.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:47.700
 So maybe that could also explain Carl Jung's idea of the archetypes. These visions are

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:52.500
 simply people connecting to the collective consciousness and extracting information from

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.500
 it.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:27:01.380
 Yeah, and Michael Persinger's view that the resonant electromagnetic fields of the

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:09.060
 earth and of our brain are coordinated, resonating with each other. And so brain-to-brain, by

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.140
 way of the earth's resonant chamber.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:18.780
 Ray, you point out how things are fluid and changing all the time, but in the Cosmic Clocks

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:26.540
 book, if he's right and the seasons are imbuing people with an essence or something,

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.660
 isn't that something that's not really changing that much?

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:37.820
 Oh, sure. Gravity and all of those things, the absolute meaning of a certain frequency

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:49.140
 of vibratory energy, each thing has its intrinsic qualities. Every substance has its unique

00:27:49.140 --> 00:28:03.180
 identity. So the surroundings are part of your identity at any moment. The de-abstraction

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:12.700
 of consciousness means that our being in its concreteness takes into account and assimilates

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:18.140
 everything around us, including the state of the sun and the planets and the earth and

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.020
 other people in that system.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:25.820
 So if two people are born in the same month, they might have a similar vibration, is that

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.820
 right?

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:35.300
 Yeah, they are more closely attuned to certain ideas and patterns. That's all it means,

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.300
 but that's a lot.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.260
 You think that may explain part of astrology and the planets?

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:47.940
 Yeah, that's what the Cosmic Clock, Gokulen, Michel Gokulen.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:53.540
 Where does that idea go off the rails, though? I'm so stupid. What's the thing that people

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:58.140
 read? They're horoscopes. Is there some point at which it becomes total nonsense?

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:07.420
 Yeah, but that's just a literary genre. It can be interesting, but it's just a person

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:16.500
 creating a cultural artifact that to some extent recognizes that we are in the cosmos

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.500
 together.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.660
 Well, here's a question. If you were going to spend your life with somebody, would the

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.220
 month that they were born in matter to you?

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:31.340
 I don't know. I think the clash of frequencies might make it more interesting than too much

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.980
 harmony of frequencies.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:40.020
 There's an optimal antagonism, so to speak, contrarianism that a lifetime partner should

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.340
 provide, otherwise it becomes boring if they're too harmonized.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:50.980
 That is sort of my impression, that you want to be able to go off independently and come

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:59.580
 back and keep renewing others with your odd and idiosyncratic learnings.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:04.540
 The Chinese have a proverb that love is not so much gazing harmoniously into each other's

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.020
 eyes, but it's about two people looking together in a similar direction.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.020
 I thought I had said that.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:17.940
 Okay, then it's a resonance, I guess, across time. Somebody may have plagiarized it off

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:24.260
 of your website and then presented it as a Taoist saying from the 6th century or something.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:29.180
 Okay, well, how about we talk about Progesty and then we'll get into some questions because

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.820
 we have some really excellent questions, I think.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:37.180
 I have one more question related to collective consciousness and Rupert Sheldrake. I don't

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:41.900
 know if you saw, he did a famous experiment with another person who was a contrarianist

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:46.220
 that it's impossible to have a collective learning experience and extracting collective

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:50.380
 knowledge from the ether. And then they did this experiments, I think, with chicks, they

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:56.140
 were training them. And then each successive generation of little chicks was able to learn

00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:01.300
 faster and faster a new task. So is there anything special that's required in order

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.680
 to be able to tune in into that collective consciousness and knowledge, like a fast metabolism?

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:11.300
 Are things that interfere with that process? In other words, making you more and more isolated

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.860
 from the collective consciousness?

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:22.420
 Yeah, I think everything metabolic and neurological affects it. Do you know who Andrea Puharich

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:32.300
 was? Henry or Andrea was his first name, but Puharich wrote a couple of books exploring

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:42.060
 what it is that opens the consciousness to remote viewing, for example. And he got the

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:49.500
 Pentagon involved and interested in it. But he was seeing it in terms of a balance between

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:58.060
 the parasympathetic and sympathetic system in a context that I think Michael Persinger

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:05.060
 comes the closest to explaining how these nervous system balances could be operating.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:13.260
 He saw when people were asleep or extremely relaxed, he imagined that their nervous system

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:21.500
 is able to sort of extend its feelers out without regard to distance, for example, tuning

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:31.060
 into the Earth's resonance. But during anxiety, there's a contraction and everything tends

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:40.300
 to fall towards the anxious center. And so if a person is in the sleep or relaxed parasympathetic

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:47.500
 state, their feelers are out. And if someone related to them is in a crisis, anxiety state

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:57.460
 of androdermic dominance, their relaxed feelers will be drawn to tune in and focus on that

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:08.020
 center of crisis or anxiety or despair. And I think that might be where Michael Persinger

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:15.700
 took up his basic orientation of Andrea Puharich was writing in the 50s and 60s.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:21.020
 I thought the Pentagon was also using LSD to drug some of the remote viewers and see

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.860
 if that enhances the performance.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:24.860
 What do you think...

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:25.860
 Mushrooms too.

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:26.860
 Mushrooms too.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:31.900
 How did you materialize from that research? How do you think it was applied? Do you know

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:32.900
 anything about that?

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:40.180
 There are several videos of some of the people who were involved working for the Pentagon-related

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:47.580
 research centers, like the Stanford Research Institute. They have their personal experience

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:52.740
 statements in videos that I think are worth watching.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.260
 Maybe they transitioned to Project Blue Beam for a fake alien invasion?

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.260
 Say that again?

00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.940
 I said, maybe they transitioned to Project Blue Beam for a fake alien invasion?

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:02.940
 Oh, oh.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:03.940
 I'm just joking.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:07.580
 Have you seen the news lately? They're always coming out of the Pentagon saying more and

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:13.060
 more UFO sightings, something big is about to happen and everybody's glued to their TV,

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.060
 which I guess is the goal, right? As long as they're not rioting.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.220
 I think it has served as a distraction for a long time.

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.100
 Okay, well, let's get into these questions because they're... Oh, let's talk about progesterone

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:29.620
 first. Ray, do you have any stories that you can grasp in your large bag of amazing stories

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.660
 about progeste that we can talk about?

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:41.100
 Oh, about any subject you want to apply it to. Dementia, epilepsy, sunburn, traumatic

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:53.060
 injury, chronic conditions of all sorts, arthritis, asthma, pimples, acne, all kinds of stress.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:59.620
 Conditions on all the cellular levels, everything from personality problems all the way down

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:03.420
 to whether a cell is inflamed.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.800
 This isn't directly related to progesterone, but a quote of yours that I sent to a lot

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:12.100
 of people is, I forgot what newsletter it was, but you say something like, "Using progesterone

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:16.340
 alone is not a good approach." You have to figure out what the problem is and usually

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:22.140
 that's related to low thyroid function. So if a problem isn't miraculously solved by

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:26.220
 progesterone, thyroid was probably the next thing to investigate.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:35.780
 Yeah. If you think you're dying of a migraine or a seizure, progesterone itself, a good

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:42.100
 dose of that can very quickly bring you out of the problem, but then you have to figure

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:48.940
 out what it was that put you into that unstable condition that needed progesterone.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.500
 And then last thing on this, some people are saying like, "If your nutrition is so good,

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:57.180
 why do you need to add hormones?" And maybe a good response to that would be, "Our environment

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:02.980
 is so terribly awful that maybe just even taking thyroid isn't enough kind of defense

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.780
 from kind of the onslaught of metabolic problems we're faced with day to day."

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:18.860
 Yeah. Even thyroid and milkshakes and quesadillas aren't always enough to make up for the horrors

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:24.580
 that are imposed on us and some of the natural defects of the environment. Like we probably

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:36.020
 should live more like naked mole rats sleeping in burrows in family clusters where we would

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:42.260
 be producing a proper amount of carbon dioxide so that we would be soaked in carbon dioxide

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:50.500
 for a good part of our lives, making up for the natural imbalance created by geological

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.500
 changes.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:56.420
 I read a book recently about how people, the difference in sleep between these days and

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:00.300
 back in the Middle Ages, and apparently people back then were sleeping in barnyards with

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:06.040
 animals, 15 to 20 people all huddled together. And I guess the rate of degenerative disease,

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.900
 maybe that's one reason why it was much lower. They were living like naked mole rats.

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:15.980
 Yeah, having a cow and a pig in the house when you're asleep.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.460
 Makes life more fun.

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:21.380
 You completely stole that out of my brain. I was going to make a joke about Ray, a long

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:24.980
 time ago you said like an optimal society would include our animal friends and I was

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.940
 going to make a joke about that and then you said it, Georgi, that's really wild.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:32.780
 That's how they used to live apparently. I mean, it was a book on anthropology. I don't

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:37.980
 remember the author names right now, but he said that our current mode of life is drastically

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:43.540
 different and judging from the archaeological findings and the examinations they did on

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:48.420
 bones and whatever records, other records they could unearth, that he's saying that

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:52.220
 apparently their lifestyle was conducive to much better health. They didn't have these

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.220
 diseases back then.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:38:01.660
 Yeah, and I think carbon dioxide is always a basic factor of stress relief or stress

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:05.020
 production depending on the concentration.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.860
 I have a question. Difference between thyroid and progesterone. Is there anything thyroid

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:16.020
 does uniquely that progesterone either completely does not do or is much weaker or less capable

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.020
 of achieving?

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:26.700
 Yeah, the mitochondrial, you can uncouple the mitochondria by increasing your thyroid

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:34.540
 temporarily to shift the ratio towards carbon dioxide from lactate and progesterone tends

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:45.940
 to stabilize the mitochondria in an efficient, well-coupled condition. So like to get rid

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:58.380
 of moles or skin cancers or such, a temporary, officially overdose of thyroid hormone. I've

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:06.100
 seen fairly large uterine fibroids, for example, when someone was willing to stay slightly

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:14.100
 hyperthyroid, keeping a resting pulse around 110 for three months, a large fibroid would

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:21.780
 shrink permitting a pregnancy to proceed. And the same with getting rid of other types

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:27.980
 of tumors and things that require corrective adjustments of the tissues.

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:31.500
 So I thought that progesterone is thermogenic. Wouldn't that imply that it also uncouples

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.500
 to a degree?

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:43.620
 I think it achieves it by reducing loss as much as by maintaining, preventing the bypass

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:49.220
 of the mitochondria. Keeps the mitochondria going efficiently, but at the same time, it's

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:54.940
 reducing nitric oxide in the skin and preventing unwanted heat loss.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:40:00.220
 Okay, great stuff. Okay, so this is our first question. And the person quotes Heraclitus

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:05.020
 and the quote is "Polymethy does not teach intelligence of things." And then their question

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.780
 is "Much learning does not teach understanding. You can't really know something unless you

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.700
 experience it. Are Ray's thoughts analogous to this?"

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:25.380
 Yeah, you have to at least imagine experiencing it. The typical way of indoctrination and

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:36.220
 school learning is by way of formulas rather than at least an imagined experience. And

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:47.140
 literature and art should teach you, get your nervous system in the habit of thinking experientially

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:51.780
 rather than in terms of algorithms and rote formulas.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:55.380
 Do you think the sterilization of learning, in other words, everybody's been turning

00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:00.700
 to not just a bookworm, but a very, what should I call it, rigid bookworm, may account for

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:05.380
 the fragmentation of society? Basically, everybody's learned, but nobody really knows much about

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.020
 the real world these days.

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:16.740
 Yeah, true kind of learning always takes into account our world in common. And so that is

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:24.420
 always an essential aspect of any little thing that you might know, how to play a music instrument

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:34.380
 or how to make a fancy horse saddle or how to build a building. It always has to take

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:39.300
 into account the overall world that we have in common.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:44.380
 So basically by preventing people from having common experiences, they essentially guarantee

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:48.180
 that we can understand each other no matter how much we read about each other.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.180
 Yeah.

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:53.260
 Great stuff. Okay, this one says, "Does Ray believe that some principles are worth dying

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:54.260
 for?"

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.260
 No.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.260
 I knew you were going to say that. Why?

00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:06.580
 Who wrote the principle? Whose principle is it? You have to look at the metaphysics behind

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:14.100
 the principle. Make sure it isn't based on false assumptions and false metaphysics.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:19.780
 Would, so dying as an alternative to getting a vaccine is not rational?

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.020
 Is there a connection?

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:27.860
 Well, so say a hypothetical thing where it was like death or getting a vaccine. Despite

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:31.660
 the horrors of getting a vaccine, killing yourself or something would not be a reasonable

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:32.660
 option.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.660
 No.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.660
 Yeah.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:40.060
 It's better to be wounded and deformed by the vaccine than to be dead.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:45.700
 I was going to say war is, what is it? The expression is war is old man talking and young

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:50.540
 man dying. So if somebody else wrote the principle, I'm with Ray on this one that you want to

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.740
 be very careful whose principles you're trying to die for.

00:42:53.740 --> 00:43:00.140
 Right. So often there's an evil ulterior motive behind the principle.

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.940
 Just to play devil's advocate, what about the phrase like, "Some things are worse than

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:10.660
 death"? Like what if life was so much suffering after getting maimed by a vaccine?

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:18.140
 I think your organism takes care of that. The stress hormones rise to the point that

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:23.900
 it simply finishes off all of the processes.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.540
 I want to go on to this next question. What's like the, you know how W.D. Denkla was trying

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.940
 to search for the death hormone. Do you feel like you figured out anything that he did

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:32.940
 not figure out?

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:43.020
 Oh yeah. There's no death hormone. It's just the death struggle of the organism against

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.940
 these bad environmental problems.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:50.020
 And perceiving that there's no progress, right? Because if it's a great struggle but the organism

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:54.740
 senses that there's progress, then this can actually, this shouldn't necessarily lead

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:55.740
 to death.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:04.180
 No, no. Those processes are really last ditch survival attempts. The zooming up of your

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:15.300
 growth hormone and prolactin and corticotropin, all of those are well-meaning survival attempts.

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:24.060
 But they just accelerate all of the poor adaptations we're making to an inadequate environment.

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:29.460
 Is death like, so those pituitary hormones are increasing, but maybe they cause prolonged

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.700
 hypoxia and that leads to death? Is that right?

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:40.340
 Well all of our adaptations are to a detective environment to one degree or another. If you

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:46.420
 have to change your physiology to fit into the environment, the bigger those changes

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:52.980
 are, the more your pituitary hormones are involved and the more it's diverting you from

00:44:52.980 --> 00:45:01.940
 what you would really like to be doing. And so the growth hormone has potential benefit,

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:11.740
 but when you're forced to keep secreting it along with ACTH and serotonin and so on, the

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:20.620
 outcome wasn't intended. But what it means is that you have adapted yourself, for example,

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:28.460
 secreting more and harder insoluble collagen, turning yourself sort of into a tanned piece

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.460
 of leather.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.460
 Saddle.

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:40.220
 It makes you tough in a sense that can stand up to the environment a little longer, but

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:50.580
 it isn't a good adaptive course to take. If we can improve the environment, have very

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:57.340
 good nutrition, very good carbon dioxide rich atmosphere, a good amount of temperature and

00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:06.940
 sunlight and so on, then we can start mobilizing our intentional adaptive processes and in

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:16.740
 that environment, the effort to adapt and become something else, you will tend to dissolve

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:22.540
 the hardened collagen, remove the calcium from the soft tissues, put it back in your

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:31.900
 bones and reconstruct a living vital organism. So the adaptive intention in a bad environment

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:37.340
 leads you into degeneration. In a good environment, it leads you to restoration.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:41.780
 I was going to say, like three or four years ago, there was a doctor and he linked something

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:46.740
 on Twitter and it was an article on fasting increasing growth hormone. And he tweeted,

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:51.940
 "This is what Ray Peat does not understand." And he was inferring like the fasting was

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.500
 increasing the growth hormone and you want to increase your growth hormone. And I just

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.940
 had a little chuckle. Okay, next question.

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:03.940
 The recent study on reversing the aging of the human immune system, they specifically

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:10.140
 administered DHEA to block the aging, the pro-aging hormones of growth hormone. And

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:13.980
 I strongly suspected the benefits that they saw from these treatments were actually due

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:18.680
 to the DHEA, but it still pays off that they actually were aware that growth hormone has

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:23.900
 strongly pro-aging effects. So you may want to send him this article or reply to his tweet

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:26.860
 because it's pretty recent. It's from last year and it was in humans.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:31.220
 Great stuff. I will do. Okay, so let's get to this next one. What is it about Aristotle

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:35.880
 that makes him a good scientist and what of his methods did the medieval scholastics fail

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.280
 to adopt?

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:48.260
 The idea of becoming, I think he took seriously Heraclitus' basic view of the world as everything

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:58.100
 being in process. So I see Aristotle as a Heraclitian process philosopher, totally breaking

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:10.020
 away from the platonic essentialism of an abstract finished universe. So he didn't have

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:16.820
 a good data collection system, maybe the best in the world at the time, but it wasn't adequate

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:20.100
 to create 20th century physics quite.

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:24.220
 I remember an old interview, maybe it was John Berkhausen and he was like, "Ray, why

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:27.700
 do you think William Blake was so smart and you said he didn't go to school?" Is there

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:32.720
 a similar thing for Aristotle? Is there any way you can figure out how he knew so much

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.620
 or his good orientation?

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:35.620
 No.

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:41.380
 Okay, fair enough. Okay, Georgi, interrupt me at any time. But okay, this is the next

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:46.660
 one from Steve. He says, "How does the intangible of stress become a tangible phenomenon in

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.620
 the cell? Where does it start?"

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:56.460
 Reduction of energy, I think, is the general thing. Not getting enough energy to do what

00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:09.260
 it needs to adapt. And so it sends out signals that want more energy and that turns on emergency

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:17.060
 organismic level processes like making more ACTH and cortisol to bring up the blood sugar

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:28.020
 and get past the temporary crisis. But the cell ultimately needs to improve its use of

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:33.700
 oxygen and glucose to properly restore the energy it needs.

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:38.260
 Just a note, thanks for that, Ray. Just a note, all the super chats or super stickers

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:43.100
 or whatever they're called will be donated to Ray. So just to let you guys know. Thank

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:48.060
 you, Ray. Okay, this next one, we are going through these. Okay, it says, "How does Dr.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:52.860
 Peat organize his reading and research? Given he reads across various topics but is able

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:57.980
 to put disparate yet related things together, does he have some sort of note-taking system

00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:58.980
 basically?"

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:02.500
 Okay, you get the point. How do you organize your research, Ray?

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:12.940
 I don't. My notes over the years are the most disorganized thing you can imagine. Occasionally,

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:19.660
 they're helpful to remind me where I was, but definitely not like having a card file

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:24.820
 of things that I've read, but just going from one thing that interests me to another.

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:30.160
 Okay, just a minute. So this is shocking to me. So when somebody emails you about something

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:35.440
 and then you reply to them and then you attach like eight abstracts, you're going to PubMed

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.540
 and finding those abstracts or what?

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:45.180
 Yeah, some of them I've put into my computer over the years for different reasons, but

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:53.100
 usually I find things on PubMed that will answer a person's questions. Even though I

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:58.540
 consider PubMed to be largely a propaganda source, it's a leaky propaganda source.

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:03.120
 I want to second that, Ray's method over the years have struggled with many different methods

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:06.980
 and eventually realized that the only thing that really worked was effectively acting

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:11.080
 like a child, just following whatever interests you at the current moment in time. And at

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:16.240
 least for me, synchronicity seems to play a big role. Things that I'm reading currently,

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:20.340
 somehow miraculously in a few minutes later, I find other things that pop up that they're

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:24.640
 disparate but similar, to use the quote from the person. Have you noticed the same thing,

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:28.460
 Ray? That if you're reading on a certain topic, basically a similar concept will pop up in

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:32.540
 another article, in another source of information, without you actually searching for it?

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:39.700
 Yep. That contributes to my basic view of how the brain and the universe work. That

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:47.820
 there's sort of a magic synchronicity, probably just because it seems like synchronicity or

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:53.500
 magic just because we aren't clearly aware of the mechanisms that make it happen.

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:58.340
 Have you noticed that children's play is structured very similarly? They basically base everything

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:02.300
 quite naturally based on interest, right? They're not being told what to do when they're

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:07.420
 little, and their attention shifts pretty quickly, but they always seem to be heavily

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.700
 engaged into what they're doing, almost as if in a state of meditation.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:18.020
 Yeah. And with kids, their choices of foods tend to work the same way. They'll eat a lot

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:25.700
 of something once and then maybe not touch it again for a month, but they're responding

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:32.220
 to something in their physiology. And I think that is true in their play. There's something

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:38.020
 in their physiology that wants to be developed as a true play.

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:42.660
 So have you had similar experiences as an adult with food, which is related to the next

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:46.420
 question that I think Danny is going to read? In other words, sometimes you eat a lot of

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:51.140
 something and then the next week you encounter the same thing and you're like, "Eh, I

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.060
 don't really feel like eating at all."

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:58.540
 Yeah. I think it works the same in adults sometimes, but more often in children.

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:02.540
 Georgi, can you push your microphone back a little bit? It's for some reason clipping

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:05.820
 a little bit. Like, no, not close to you, farther away.

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:06.820
 Oh, okay. Like this?

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:12.580
 Yeah. Or if you move the actual unit a little bit back. Yeah. Okay, good. Thanks for that.

00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:17.860
 Okay. So speaking of that question, so this person made sure to clarify and they said

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:22.460
 they weren't asking this so they could copy you. They were just curious. And so this person

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:26.860
 says, "Can Ray go over what his past week of eating has looked like? Meal examples,

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:31.700
 new preferences and tastes, or new experiments with food/meal ideas?"

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:40.540
 They tend to cycle. Today, so far, I've had an omelet, milk, orange juice, and coffee,

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:46.300
 and then some leftover mushroom soup and carrot salad and orange juice and coffee for the

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:57.060
 afternoon. Yesterday, I had an appetite for a cheese taco, a toasted taco with melted

00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:06.060
 cheese on it. And it just is what I feel I have an appetite for that particular day.

00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:12.540
 I think our last chat with you increased tortilla sales by like 1,000% all over the world.

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:18.500
 Ray, you're responsible for the inflation of food we're seeing all over the US.

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:26.060
 I noticed that many years ago when I discovered that the Safeway store was selling chicken

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:31.700
 necks at something like a dollar a pound. And I found two or three thyroid glands in

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:38.820
 every package, a couple of pounds of necks. I mentioned that in my nutrition classes and

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:47.620
 never saw a package of necks again. They constantly were buying them up and then Safeway stopped

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:51.620
 selling them, I guess, when the word got out that they contained thyroid glands.

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:56.420
 You've got to be careful about those liver sources and other things that you need to

00:54:56.420 --> 00:55:01.820
 feel well. Yeah, for sure. Okay, next question here. And then I was interested in, after

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:05.440
 these questions, asking you some things just about, of course, the culture stuff that we

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.700
 always go over, but I thought this would be a nice break from just getting questions from

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:13.020
 Georgi and I. Okay, where ... Now I've lost my place in these questions. Thanks everybody

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:16.740
 for watching. Give this episode a like. Again, all super chats or super stickers or whatever

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:21.700
 are donated to Ray. And sincere appreciation for Ray and Georgi being here and taking

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:29.100
 their time to do this for everybody. Okay, building off of the idea that when thyroid

00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:33.580
 is functioning properly, you can think any way you want to about anything. Can you explain

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:37.860
 more about the physiological aspects of how our energetic state influences our thoughts

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:42.580
 and perception? Is there an energetic component to thoughts that matches biological energy,

00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:47.140
 or is it more so that a higher energetic state ... And I think I clipped this question, but

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:53.580
 you get the idea. Yeah, I think the high energy state is a

00:55:53.580 --> 00:56:04.660
 relaxed state of readiness. The infant brain with a very high metabolic rate easily goes

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:14.220
 into complete relaxed sleep and replenishes its energy so it's ready for another episode

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:27.020
 of very intense activity. That kind of episodic energy burst, I think, tend to give you an

00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:37.060
 image-oriented kind of chunky approach to reality and the problems you're thinking of

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:46.100
 rather than just doggedly assembling bits and constructing a knowledge system out of

00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:54.580
 learned bits. It gives you an animal quality to your episodes of learning and thinking.

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:59.660
 And like ruminating on the past, so that's that junky quality you're talking about, like

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:03.540
 thinking about things that have literally no importance and can't move you forward?

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:12.060
 Well, sometimes it's necessary to think about where you've been to better understand why

00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:18.480
 you want to go in a certain direction. So ruminating can be constructive.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:21.920
 One last thing. So I think you specifically talking about that quote, somebody emailed

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:27.980
 you about trauma a long time ago, and you basically said if the toxicants and the energy

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:33.680
 substances and things are right, you can kind of think how you want to about past events.

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:37.940
 And so that just includes kind of intermittently thinking about things that have happened in

00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:41.500
 the past. That doesn't mean you reject what's happened to you. You're just not stuck on

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.500
 them. Is that right?

00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:54.140
 Yeah. My view of memory is that it's a developmental state. Even though it passes in a flash, still

00:57:54.140 --> 00:58:00.740
 it changes our development all through the organism. Every little so-called memory, memorable

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:08.020
 experience that we have is changing the structure of our organism. And it's simply scanning

00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:16.140
 the state of our organism when you're ruminating or considering the meaning of the past. It's

00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:24.660
 all present in the state of your organism. When you're remembering, you're really being

00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:26.500
 present to yourself.

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:31.940
 Interesting. Okay. This one is, "May you ask Ray what he thinks about some people being

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:38.540
 more subservient to authority than others? Why do some have this innate rebellious attitude

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:41.980
 while others follow the narrative, no questions asked?"

00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:51.420
 It has a lot to do with your metabolic energy, how much DHEA and progesterone and pregnenolone

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:59.540
 are circulating through your system. So you feel resilient enough to reject every little

00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:03.540
 thing that seems unhealthy.

00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:06.740
 Great stuff. I didn't know if this was true, but this next one says, "Thoughts on Chernobyl

00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:09.140
 steadily reactivating." Is that right?

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:10.380
 Say it again.

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:14.260
 It says, "Thoughts on Chernobyl steadily reactivating." Is that a thing?

00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:22.980
 I'm not sure what it means. The area around Chernobyl continues to be extremely contaminated

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:23.980
 and deadly.

00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:27.940
 There were a few articles, I think it was last week, at least the ones that I saw, that

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:34.740
 said that the detectors that are there in the sealed reactor that is under a concrete

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:39.740
 sarcophagus, they're detecting levels of radiation that are increasing and can only be produced

00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:42.340
 if the chain reaction is somehow intensifying.

00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:48.260
 That's definitely possible. Molten fuel, for example, is moving around.

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:53.300
 Yeah, they were thinking of essentially sending a robot in there and basically sealing the

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:57.740
 actual reactor, the smaller portion of it, with graphite, is what they said, to sort

00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:01.540
 of stop the chain. They will try to stop the chain reaction, but they're also kind of hedging

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:08.380
 their bets and saying, "It may actually trigger a nuclear blast, so we're not promising any

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:09.380
 results."

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:14.220
 We'll do a few more of these and then we'll let you go at, well, it's my time, your 6.30

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:16.620
 time for sure, Ray, so we won't keep you too long.

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:21.660
 Okay, "How to stop, slow down body hair and beard hair growth. Could topical progesterone

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.180
 work or something else?"

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:30.980
 There were studies published in France in the 1960s of topical progesterone showed women

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:41.620
 with definite sideburns and whiskers and masculine chest hair who, through topical progesterone,

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:48.540
 two or three months later, showed them with a feminine, hairless face and chest.

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:52.500
 And same thing for a man, right? That would be the estrogen maybe activating the adrenals

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:56.660
 and causing the skin to kind of be androgenized, is that right?

01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:03.980
 Yes, when you're deficient in those protective hormones, especially pregnenolone and progesterone,

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:14.740
 then you're likely to overdrive the stress hormones and come out with too much androgens,

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:18.420
 especially in women, and too much estrogen in men.

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:24.580
 And just an update, on the Coke here, now all of the bottles say "Reducido Azúcar,"

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:28.940
 and then I talked to the dude that works at the Tienda and he said all of the Coke now

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:34.060
 is like that in Mexico. And so that is a thing now, like they've just changed the formula

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:38.140
 of Coke and all of it tastes different now. And the dude confirmed that, just to give

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:40.780
 an update for anybody who cares. So that is very sad day.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.020
 What kind of sugar is this?

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:47.920
 I wish I had written it down, but it was like a mixture of new types of sugar. This is totally

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.920
 new to you, right?

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.980
 Yeah, I hadn't heard it at all.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:57.940
 I told the guy it was "Muy Malo," and he laughed. Okay, so let's get to these last, I skipped

01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:01.940
 over a few, but let's get to, okay, this was a popular one. Is there a way to remineralize

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.660
 teeth and heal cavities?

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:12.660
 Basically no. If the enamel is just slightly eroded and the protein framework is still

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:21.900
 there, yeah, it can be very nicely remineralized. But once the decay has gone through the thin

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:29.460
 layer of dentine and has broken down the dentine, gone through the thin layer of enamel and

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:38.220
 entered the dentine, then the tooth from the inside can close off the progress. If you

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:48.140
 have a very stable hormonal vitamin D calcium balance, the tooth from the inside is constantly

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:58.300
 renewing the cytoplasm in the dentine channels and will close off, create resistance to the

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:06.340
 advancing cavity. But I've never heard of being able to fill a cavity from the inside.

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:08.380
 It can simply stop the progress.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:12.620
 Have you seen that study that got published in 2018? I think it was basically they showed

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:17.300
 that applying aspirin topically to the tooth, despite being acidic, actually led to tooth

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:21.980
 regeneration. I forget how much was regenerated, but it reversed that process and some actual

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:22.980
 regeneration happened.

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:28.700
 Was it in the dentine or just the enamel surface?

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:32.540
 That I don't know. I mean, it may have been just a very, very shallow cavity and that's

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:37.660
 why it regenerated. But I remember it was aspirin, it was topical solution. And they

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:41.300
 were surprised too. They thought that because it's acidic, it should actually erode the

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:46.460
 tooth even more. But in fact, it actually led to some regeneration.

01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:53.580
 I think the acid theory of tooth decay has tremendous weakness. The idea that bacteria

01:03:53.580 --> 01:04:00.340
 just make an acid. I think it's much more complicated than that involving antibodies

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:04.220
 and subtler handling of the minerals.

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:10.940
 You may have seen it. There was a study earlier than that back in 2015, which said that unbeknownst

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:16.300
 to most people, competitive athletes have extremely poor dental health. And that study

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:20.860
 tied that poor dental health to low thyroid function because of the constant exertion

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:21.860
 they were having.

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:30.580
 I didn't see that one, but thyroid is the main regulator of the health of your saliva

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:38.420
 and the quality of your saliva really is in charge of what happens to your teeth on the

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:44.860
 outside and it tends to correspond to the vitality of the pulp chamber, which maintains

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:52.460
 the dentine from the inside. But definitely the thyroid is the main hormone governing

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:54.100
 the quality of saliva.

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:58.080
 Great stuff. So I was thinking for the last 25 minutes, we would just tune into the Great

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:03.100
 Reset and is there anything new that, of course there is, but is there anything to focus on

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:08.540
 that's happening that's mildly interesting or reveals something that they're doing?

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:16.140
 The established lies are coming apart and resistance is starting to show some effects.

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.820
 Do you mean the Wuhan lab stuff?

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:32.060
 Yeah. Ron Unz, he has a good article showing the value of two articles, different theories,

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:38.060
 whether it was a lab accident or not, but then he gives a third interpretation that

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:48.580
 everyone seems to be carefully avoiding, which is the long established germ warfare policies

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:57.620
 of the United States. Unz goes through the facts that align so much more perfectly with

01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:04.380
 this third option than with just the lab accident or not theories.

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:08.400
 There's another article on the site, a recent one on his site, which says that basically

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:12.740
 it was a failed bioweapon attack on China launched by the United States and when the

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:16.820
 Chinese didn't take the bait, then basically the US said, well, we have an opportunity

01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:21.060
 to use it on somebody else. Who would that be? Well, our population and the rest of the

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:26.300
 world and we're going to use this to tighten control for whatever other reason we have.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:35.020
 Iran really was the second target, just the elite politicians in Iran had a very terrible

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:45.140
 attack right after China. I think one misapprehension of the germ warfare people, they really seem

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:54.780
 to have believed that the ACE2 enzyme, they thought it was the receptor that let the virus

01:06:54.780 --> 01:07:01.780
 attack and enter cells. I think they really believed that. And the fact that the Chinese

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:09.740
 have about 30% higher expression of the ACE2 enzyme, especially in women, women have a

01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:17.820
 higher expression than in men and in both sexes, the expression of ACE2 decreases with

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:31.260
 aging. But I think the fact that the Chinese have such a thick expression of this ACE2

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:38.860
 anti-angiotensin enzyme, I think that led people to believe that the Chinese would suffer

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:50.300
 much more intensely from this virus than Americans or other racial groups. But in fact, the ACE2

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:58.100
 is what defends us against inflammatory attacks such as virus. And so the populations that

01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:04.780
 express the most ACE2 rather than being the most susceptible to catching the virus, they're

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:11.820
 the ones with the most powerful means for resisting the inflammatory consequences. So

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:20.860
 women, young women are the most resistant, but it happens that the Chinese heredity gives

01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:22.540
 them an especially high resistance.

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:27.300
 I'm not saying it wasn't produced in a lab, but isn't the idea that it's a bioweapon kind

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:32.780
 of conflict with the idea that it's not harmful at all? I mean, the activation of the renin

01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:39.380
 angiotensin system, but that all of this stuff is just way overboard and just about control.

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:47.460
 Yeah. Rona Unz talks about that, that it wasn't intended to kill many people and didn't really

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:54.180
 kill lots of people, but it was a nuisance just like an effective cold virus. But the

01:08:54.180 --> 01:09:00.140
 theory was that it would give Chinese 30% more colds than it would give Americans.

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:05.380
 Oh, interesting. And for this whole thing to work, would they really had to have created

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:10.220
 something? I don't buy into it, but the alt narrative that there's nothing, you know what

01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:14.580
 I mean? And actually a lot of major, I think Patrick Timpani, he keeps listing people saying

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:20.060
 that there is no virus, but isn't the whole thing now that, what's that word they say

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:23.700
 for making viruses? It's in the news all the time now. You know what I'm talking about?

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.660
 The Fauci keeps saying it, like they'll enhance a virus or whatever.

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:27.660
 Oh, gain of function.

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:30.780
 Yeah, gain of function. But anyways, you're saying they had to have created something,

01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:31.780
 right?

01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:42.220
 Yeah. Luc Montagnier has clearly expressed that he, in his lab work, understands how

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:50.540
 you create a gain of function. You find some species difference, like the human expression

01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:58.780
 of the ACE2 enzyme was chosen as a target. And so they just adjusted the enzyme to be

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:03.660
 able to stick more firmly, adjusted the virus so that it would stick more firmly to that

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:13.740
 enzyme. And the people are arguing against the whole existence of viruses are in a way

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:22.260
 onto something because the mechanism by which we maintain our genetic and physiological

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:29.700
 interactions among the various parts of our body, the circulatory systems are carrying

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:36.700
 exosomes in which our cells put out genetic messages that are sent to other cells. But

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:47.500
 this apparatus is the same one that the viruses use to replicate the viral message. And in

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:55.700
 size and structure, our exosomes are in most ways indistinguishable from the things that

01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:02.540
 are classified as viruses. And so if you give a vaccine or catch a virus and get the nucleic

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:08.820
 acids into some of your cells, those cells experiencing distress will increase their

01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:16.140
 production of exosomes, which pick up relevant bits of nucleic acid and proteins and lipids

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:23.420
 and package them in a little virus-like package, which those exosomes then travel to different

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:32.140
 parts of the body and are excreted in sweat, in the breath, in the urine and so on. And

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:40.380
 so we are creating things that function like viruses and look like viruses and are made

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:48.860
 in the same system in the cell that replicate viruses. So I think the people that deny that

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:54.700
 there is such a thing as a virus are really just helping to call attention to the probable

01:11:54.700 --> 01:12:08.660
 origin of all viruses was the mixture of external transmitted nucleic acids, basically transmitted,

01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:15.940
 excreted and transmitted in the form of exosomes as a natural physiological adaptive process.

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:21.220
 Now, aren't the mRNA vaccines essentially an artificial replication of that whole exosome

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:23.460
 paradigm, but in a really harmful manner?

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:30.860
 Yeah, I don't know how aware the virus people were of exosomes, but that's something that

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:39.180
 is completely left out of most of the discussion. In fact, the vaccine nucleic acid, the messenger

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:49.180
 RNA can be packaged into exosomes and transmitted to other cells, including our germ cells and

01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:53.100
 into our sweat and transmitted to people we touch or breathe on.

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.100
 Speaking of that-

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:58.740
 A couple more things on Montagnier. He said as early as March, 2020, that the virus is

01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:03.580
 most certainly man-made after having studied it for a couple of months. And he basically

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:08.860
 said this virus contains sequences that are not known to occur in any natural virus of

01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:14.540
 the same category of the coronavirus, including a protein sequence that is known to be part

01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:19.740
 of the HIV virus. And then of course, immediately French press started publishing articles saying

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:22.660
 he must have run out of his anti-psychotic medication.

01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:29.860
 Yeah, what they're doing now, the last two or three days, I think they've created another

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:35.620
 crazy story claiming that he says all the vaccinated people will be dead within two

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:44.460
 years just to make him sound crazy. He didn't say that, but by inserting that claiming that

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:53.780
 he said that they're denaturing, defanging his actual message that the virus was deliberate

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:56.380
 and stupid and dangerous.

01:13:56.380 --> 01:14:00.620
 What about his other message from the same interview, which he said that having a vaccination

01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:05.660
 campaign during pandemic is absolutely the dumbest thing a public health agency can do

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:12.860
 because it's actually causing the virus to mutate in order to avoid the vaccine and evolve.

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:17.420
 And that's what's creating the new "variants". And in fact, it's making people more susceptible

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:22.100
 to dying from these new variants due to the antibody dependent enhancement process.

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:29.220
 Yeah, that's the sort of thing he says that they want to shut up by making him sound crazy.

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:33.340
 Do you think there's any truth to that? Basically, that these people are now more susceptible

01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:39.260
 to dying from future encountering either another coronavirus or any virus really? Because you

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:44.300
 said something similar about the flu vaccines, that some of the deaths from coronavirus were

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:46.140
 following flu vaccination campaigns.

01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:51.820
 Yeah, but several studies have shown that people who were vaccinated for influenza the

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:59.500
 following season were much, much more likely to catch a coronavirus. So you become partially

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:07.660
 immune to influenza, but instead you substitute increased susceptibility to coronavirus infection.

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:16.220
 So the whole thing, all of the facts invalidate the claims both about influenza vaccines and

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:17.220
 the COVID.

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:21.060
 So which one do you think is a bigger worry for a vaccinated person? The chronic inflammatory

01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:25.860
 state, which these vaccines will probably trigger and keep for a long time, potentially

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:32.100
 for life and even transgenerational, or the potential for ADE when this person encounters

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:34.900
 another virus later on in their life?

01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:46.180
 The risk of exaggerated antibody intensification of symptoms, the risk is so great that even

01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:52.220
 though we don't know how often it's going to happen, it's just a very crazy risk to

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:54.500
 take for the world population.

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:58.540
 So these people could die 10 years from now when they encounter a completely different

01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:02.380
 virus and of course you'll never be tied back to the vaccine they got 10 years ago.

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:03.380
 Yeah.

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:08.260
 I wanted to get your thoughts on the Israel-Palestine stuff, but one question I have for you about

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:15.660
 that is why, and maybe this is wrong, but why doesn't Israel give the Palestinians vaccines?

01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:19.780
 Or is it some kind of reverse psychology thing that they're withholding vaccines from?

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:28.100
 Part of the truth is probably that like American, black people often look at the history of

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:36.940
 what the CDC has done experimenting on black people, experimenting in other countries,

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:44.340
 doing experiments in the guise of vaccine where really they're doing something else.

01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:53.380
 I think a lot of Palestinians are likewise fearful of being experimented on by the vaccinators.

01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:56.820
 So that would just be a no-sell immediately, like if Israel was like, "We have vaccines

01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.780
 for Palestinians," they would never accept those?

01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:04.020
 If I was a Palestinian, I don't think I would.

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:08.100
 No, I mean, there's actually documented cases around the world.

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:13.100
 I think in Afghanistan and Pakistan, they kicked out representatives of a World Health

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:17.220
 Organization because now they're firmly convinced that the vaccines that they're getting, donations

01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:20.540
 from Western countries are intended to sterilize the population.

01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:23.060
 And we have now some evidence that the same thing is happening in Africa.

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:26.740
 So I don't think it's just the Palestinians that are mistrustful.

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:31.380
 It's kind of like a third world being always suspicious of the rich people and their attempts

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:34.460
 to provide benefit to the poor plebs.

01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.100
 They will never take that openly.

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:37.100
 Right.

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:40.820
 I kind of understand why the elites here would want to depopulate the US, but why would they

01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:41.820
 want to do that in Israel?

01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:45.860
 Oh, well, they're set on getting rid of the Palestinians.

01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:53.340
 But why would Israel vaccinate its own citizens if the higher-ups, assuming that they understand

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.740
 that this vaccine is to harm people?

01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:58.260
 I'm not sure what they understand.

01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:03.300
 So Netanyahu doesn't think it's possible that he doesn't know it's for depopulation?

01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.140
 I think that's possible.

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:10.740
 In other words, the elite may be sometimes stupid and not know that what they have unleashed

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:11.740
 on themselves.

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:12.740
 Is that what I'm hearing?

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:18.100
 Yeah, the elite isn't unified.

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:25.620
 On a world scale, they're unified in the sense of being a ruling class with its own interest.

01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:33.380
 But within that power system, there are constant subdivisions of power conflicts.

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:41.020
 And so you have to look at each country's power elite and how it relates to the others.

01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:46.700
 So like Maxwell doesn't care about some Israeli citizen that, I don't know, shine shoes or

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:50.340
 something, just as much as a Rockefeller doesn't care about an American.

01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:52.740
 Kind of the same type of thing?

01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:53.740
 Yeah.

01:18:53.740 --> 01:19:04.180
 The European Jews have a very race-like discrimination against the Jews of other origins, especially

01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:05.780
 African-originating Jews.

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:06.780
 Interesting.

01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:08.220
 Okay, so we have about eight minutes left.

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:14.580
 Is there anything that we should navigate to quickly before calling it a day?

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:15.580
 You know what, though?

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.900
 Let me answer that question that I just said.

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:22.540
 What do you think about the ousting or throwing under the bus Bill Gates?

01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:25.580
 I haven't heard much about what's going on.

01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:31.940
 Well, he was framed as a womanizer and then Melinda and him got a divorce and now his

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:36.300
 name is like the media is all over him as a bad person.

01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:42.980
 It has been coming out gradually ever since Epstein killed himself, supposedly.

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:55.300
 The story was involving Bill Clinton and lots of the elite out political crowd and he was

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:57.900
 in it right from an early stage.

01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:59.900
 It just takes time to develop.

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:03.980
 I know that, but do you think he was impeding kind of their goals?

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:07.380
 Like he has such a bad reputation now that they're like, "We need to do something

01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:09.380
 to get this guy off the air," or something like that?

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:12.980
 I know I'm asking you to speculate, but it just seems so odd that they turn on...

01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:17.280
 Like that Epstein stuff has been around for a very long time and then the media just automatically

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.280
 picks up on it now.

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:20.500
 Like, it doesn't make any sense.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:24.500
 I think the media are in turmoil.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:30.860
 They are confused by things leaking out that shouldn't have, and I think they are in the

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:38.140
 process of reorganizing and trying to find a new equilibrium that can be sustained, but

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:40.180
 everything does seem to be falling apart.

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:41.820
 Yeah, I saw an article.

01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:46.020
 It was in Russia Today, which not many people read, but basically they're saying that Western

01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:49.820
 media is largely collapsing due to...

01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:56.060
 Also I mean, no pun intended, collapsing viewings and readings from the general population.

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:59.420
 Nobody seems to be going to mainstream media anymore.

01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:03.300
 I mean, an increasingly smaller percentage of people are reading it, which means less

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:07.740
 ad revenue, and unless the government starts to pay the media directly to subsidize them,

01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:09.860
 they don't really have a survival plan.

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:16.620
 Yeah, I think those forces are really stirring up confusion in the mass media on different

01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:17.620
 sides.

01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:20.140
 Okay, absolute last thing, and then I'll read the super chats.

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:24.860
 Ray, I feel like the olive oil on the carrot or mushrooms is like a revelation.

01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:29.860
 I think it works so much better than coconut oil, and so I just want to...

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:33.860
 I think my digestion is the best it's ever been, and the only thing that I can think

01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:35.860
 of that I changed was the olive oil.

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:36.860
 Does that make sense?

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:40.300
 Yeah, I noticed the same thing.

01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:48.540
 There are allergenic properties in coconut that even extreme refining can miss, but olive

01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:54.460
 oil in the unrefined state, it's a fruit oil, not a seed oil.

01:21:54.460 --> 01:22:05.140
 And as such, it brings with the oil a lot of anti-inflammatory, very protective intestinal

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:08.540
 redesigning and protecting drug effects.

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:11.420
 One last food question for me, because since you brought up the food thing.

01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:18.340
 Ray, I noticed you've commented in the past on orange peel as being very high in things

01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:21.660
 like naringenin, hisperidin, et cetera, et cetera.

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:27.020
 What are your thoughts on orange peel wax, which is available as basically food grade

01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:32.260
 material and it's got this really dark red, almost brownish color, which makes me think

01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:33.740
 it's very, very high.

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:36.860
 It's a concentrated form, basically, dietary form of all of these flavonoids.

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:38.640
 What was it called?

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.920
 Orange peel wax.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:46.620
 It consists of about 50 to 60% of polycorsonil basically, but its color is very dark red,

01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:50.520
 almost like a brick, which makes me think it's high in these flavonoids that we know

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:52.180
 have protective effects.

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:53.180
 It sounds good.

01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:54.900
 I'll find out more about it.

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:59.940
 But meanwhile, marmalade tastes very good and has those same things.

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:02.020
 So does the pulp need to be removed?

01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:05.340
 It's only basically a thin scraping of the peel?

01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:07.380
 Is that what's the beneficial part?

01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:14.460
 Pretty much the whole thing, the white stuff as well as the orange stuff, has those flavonoids.

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:15.460
 Okay.

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:17.300
 So here are the donations.

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:18.460
 My computer doesn't start.

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:19.460
 Okay.

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:20.460
 Peggy for $10.

01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:21.460

01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:22.460
 Thank you so much, Jean.

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:23.460
 Plu Plus for 50 SAR.

01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:27.180
 I don't know what that is.

01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:28.540
 David Hendricks for $20.

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:29.540
 Thank you so much.

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:31.300
 Janet Pack for $20.

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:32.300
 Thank you so much, Janet.

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:35.060
 Piordor, I won't even try your last name, 199.

01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.340
 Thank you so much, Piordor.

01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:37.660
 Linda Belfry for $5.

01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:38.660
 Thank you so much.

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.420
 And Pure Therapy for 499.

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:41.980
 Thank you so much, Pure Therapy.

01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:44.580
 And then there's one last one, I think from Michelle for $50.

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:45.580
 Wow.

01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:46.580
 Okay.

01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:47.580
 I will send all of those to Ray.

01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:49.780
 Let me do one more advertisement for Ray here.

01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:51.500
 The newsletter is available by email now.

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:52.500
 It's $28.

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:55.180
 You can send it to raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:23:55.180 --> 01:24:01.260
 And then you can purchase progesterone, Progeste from Keenogen by emailing Catherine at keenogen@gmail.com.

01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:04.940
 And each bottle contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone.

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:05.940
 Okay.

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:08.020
 That is the last thing.

01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:09.180
 Ray, any parting words?

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:10.420
 And Georgi, any parting words?

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:11.420
 Not really.

01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:15.140
 I mean, I'm glad that the narrative is falling apart and hopefully the elite will consume

01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:19.180
 itself and not force us to take matters into our own hands.

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:20.180
 Well, okay.

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.180
 Ray, stay on the line.

01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:22.620
 We'll just keep you for one minute extra.

01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:23.780
 Guys, thank you so much.

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:26.900
 Give this episode a like, share it online, et cetera.

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:27.900
 We have an amazing listenership.

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:28.900

 These are always extremely fun to do.

01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:34.420
 Sincere thanks to Ray, sincere thanks to Georgi for making these possible and our amazing

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:35.860
 audience for also making it possible.

01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:36.860
