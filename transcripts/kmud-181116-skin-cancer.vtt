00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Arab Doctor. The third Friday of the month and

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.760
 every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8pm the program runs and we have a live show

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.720
 where we take callers from 7.30 until 8 o'clock, inviting them to call in with questions either

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.560
 related or sometimes unrelated to the topic of the month's subject. This month we're going

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.960
 to be discussing skin cancers amongst a few other things and treatment approaches and/or

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.840
 prevention strategies. The number if you live in the area or indeed if you live outside

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:48.280
 the area or you're from Australia or somewhere like that is 707-923-3911. These programs

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:59.480
 are also archived on the web at www.kmud.org. Under the audio archives tab people want to

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.880
 scroll down to Friday Night Talk, choose the third Friday of each month. They keep them

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.520
 for about two months and fortunately most of these shows have been put up by several

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.240
 individuals on YouTube so the YouTube channels also cover most of the shows that we've done.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.520
 And our website www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com also has a link in the resources tab and every

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.600
 show that we've done by the last few months of this year are up there and free to download.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.000
 We do get calls and emails from people telling us how much they've enjoyed them and they've

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.360
 just come upon them and they've never heard anything like it so that's why we do this.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.160
 But alternative approach, I graduated with a degree in herbal medicine in England in

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.200
 1999, I've been practicing ever since and we run a business where we produce alternative

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:04.000
 supplements, dietary supplements to promote and support well-being. We've had on the show

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.200
 Dr. Raymond Peat with us for a number of years now. I think I last counted it was getting

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.360
 on close to 10 and always very pleased to have his wisdom on the show because he comes

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.360
 from a different era, not just from his age but also from the way things were understood

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:32.400
 back then and before the financial interests steamrolled the way they do now. So Dr. Raymond

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.040
 Peat is on the show to join us this evening and are you there Dr. Peat?

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.040
 Yes, hello.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.760
 Well thanks so much as always for giving your time as freely as you always do every third

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.020
 Friday of the month on the show. For those people who perhaps have never heard you or

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.800
 never read your work, would you give an outline of your academic and your professional background

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.280
 so that people know where you come from?

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.440
 I graduated from Southern Oregon College in 1956 with a bachelor's degree majoring in

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.240
 humanities and then I went to the University of Oregon for a master's degree, got that

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:19.040
 and I taught for several years linguistics and other subjects and then in 1968 went back

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.800
 to the University of Oregon in biology for a PhD in 1972.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.320
 And you've been working ever since then and you do your own independent research and you

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:39.920
 always come up with at least a handful of people, published people and other authors

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.960
 that show work that you probably wouldn't find too much evidence of now unless you were

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.160
 really digging for it deeply and indeed you have spent and you still spend a lot of your

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.160
 time.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:00.560
 I actually started reading old medical textbooks in the 1940s.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.560
 In libraries folks.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.800
 I found that there was more interesting stuff in the old books than they were teaching in

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.240
 college that's why I studied humanities rather than sciences at first.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:22.200
 And you've been applying your rationale to people when they approach you asking what

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.600
 would you do if such and such were happening and you've been doing this now for how many

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.600
 thirty forty years?

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.920
 At least forty five.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.920
 At least forty five.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.080
 All right well good.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.000
 So without much further ado just want to remind people that is a live call in show.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.920
 People do call in from California all over the states and indeed from abroad and the

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:53.520
 area code here is 707 923 3911 and incidentally we can be reached at the end of the business

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.560
 end of the show during normal business hours 1 888 WBM ERB.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:08.000
 So there's a lot of ongoing debate between pro UV exposure groups and the cover up anti

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.560
 UV camps.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.320
 On the one hand solar UV radiation represents a most significant environmental risk factor

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.000
 for the development of non melanoma skin cancer.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.680
 Consequently protection from this is an important approach especially in risk groups.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.500
 Ninety percent of all vitamin D in the body has to be formed in the skin through the action

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:34.440
 of UV radiation and the dilemma is the undeniable association between vitamin D deficiency and

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.600
 a host of pathologies ranging from various cancers like colon prostate and breast which

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.720
 have been confirmed in a large number of studies as well as bone diseases autoimmune diseases

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.460
 infectious and cardiovascular diseases and hypertension.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.220
 So vitamin D's benefit is pretty unquestionable at this point.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.080
 So strict sun protection causes vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency and the idea that

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.240
 sunlight and vitamin D inhibit the growth of human cancers is not new.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:15.560
 So looking at the radiation from the sun the main the main two groups are UV A and B with

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.980
 the ozone layer taking out all of the UVC.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:27.560
 So both both cause damage now the UVB causes a rearrangement of DNA producing what they

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.920
 call photo products which are known mutagens causing cancer and then UVA in its own right

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:40.760
 causes damage via oxidative type processes and the suppression of the skin's immune system

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.760
 has been shown to represent another mechanism by which solar radiation induces and promotes

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.960
 skin cancer growth.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.440
 So I think just to start I know you've mentioned that immunosuppressive properties have been

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:01.600
 demonstrated for both UVA and B but I think just to go over what we've already mentioned

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.920
 the topic cholesterol extensively and hopefully people are beginning to get the message that

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.360
 cholesterol is actually not a villain it's actually very important and everything that

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:17.680
 they want you know for want of a better word the industry does to control cholesterol in

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.160
 patients that have quote unquote high cholesterol which you've already mentioned for anybody

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:30.760
 over 50 wants to be at least 200 milligram percent and most people that are showing you

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.400
 know a cholesterol of 200 or slightly above get put on statins and we'll talk about statins

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.600
 in a bit because there's even more evidence to suggest that they are very harmful and

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.520
 actually they do a lot more harm than any good that they've purportedly done apart from

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.400
 increasing the profits of the companies that produce them.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:56.080
 So can you speak a little bit of the effect of skin cholesterol on the conversion by UV

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.960
 light or the conversion of cholesterol to vitamin D and the difference between a young

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.640
 person's skin and an aging person's skin because I think if you mentioned that the cholesterol

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.480
 content is a very important factor which is decreased in the elderly.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:17.920
 Yeah they've known for several years that over the age of 60 or 70 it takes about twice

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:25.680
 as much sunlight exposure to produce the same amount of vitamin D and it turns out that

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:34.680
 simply because old skin has only about half as much cholesterol as young skin and that

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.520
 is not confined to the skin.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:50.920
 The age effect occurs in the adrenal glands for example which are the largest producers

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:56.720
 of not only steroid hormones but of cholesterol itself.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:05.720
 The digestive system, the intestine and liver are important sources of cholesterol but the

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:14.360
 brain and skin produce usually most of the cholesterol that they need but all of those

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:24.600
 organs, the machinery for producing cholesterol declines with aging roughly 50% by old age

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:34.480
 and in the skin it becomes obvious that the vitamin D isn't produced in the sunlight but

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.480
 every organ, the cholesterol has many functions.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:45.800
 The brain produces steroids from cholesterol the same way the gonads and adrenal glands

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.800
 do.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:59.680
 The skin can produce steroid hormones from cholesterol and any injury to the skin, even

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:08.400
 intense blue light or injecting irritating substances will cause the skin to defensively

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:16.560
 increase the production of both cholesterol and the vitamin D derived from it to the extent

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.520
 that it can according to its age and health.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.960
 Is this, can I just interrupt for a second, is this the mechanism by which you've mentioned

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:32.920
 in the past that the polyunsaturated lipid byproducts, lipofuscine in particular being

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:40.560
 so oxidative damage the endothelia and the body then produces the cholesterol to repair

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:47.440
 that damage and that actually is not a problem with cholesterol being found in blockage but

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.760
 it's actually the underlying insult but the cholesterol is an immediate response to that

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.760
 stress.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:11:01.720
 Once the oxidative damage occurs that damage is enough to rouse the system to produce vitamin

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:10.960
 D and cholesterol but the polyunsaturated fat, its direct action on the cholesterol

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:23.000
 enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, it inhibits the production where the saturated fats don't

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.720
 inhibit cholesterol production.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:33.680
 So if you're going to use any oil on the skin it should be cocoa butter or cow butter or

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.160
 anything highly saturated and not any of the PUFA.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:44.640
 Right, now you've mentioned this a lot of times now so people out there that are using

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:51.920
 creams especially for things you know like rejuvenating creams or anti-aging or wrinkle

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:57.560
 creams or you know creams that are supposedly plumping up the epidermis and returning that

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.320
 youthful look should definitely not be based on polyunsaturates.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:06.280
 Yeah, there were experiments about 30-40 years ago on rabbits.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:13.320
 They shaved their backs so that they were exposed to ultraviolet sunlight and the rabbits

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:21.280
 that were fed polyunsaturated fats developed quickly wrinkled aged skin on their backs

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:27.920
 and the ones with the saturated diet didn't have that sun damage.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:38.000
 The polyunsaturated, the double bonds are especially reactive to ultraviolet light but

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:46.520
 even through indirect pathways even blue light can activate the lipid proxidation process.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:59.800
 For example, vitamin B2, yellow vitamin, absorbs blue light and is excited chemically and it

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.000
 becomes reactive.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Either the ultraviolet or blue light will create a vitamin deficiency in effect impairing

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.840
 the ability of the cell to produce energy oxidatively and that leads to the production

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.920
 of lactic acid which creates inflammation.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:29.400
 So even blue light can lead to a fatigued process of the cell leading to inflammation

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.400
 and degeneration.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:36.560
 And this is via polyunsaturates and this is why you advocate eliminating polyunsaturates

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:42.480
 from your diet and just switching it all out to saturated sources and that over time you

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:48.920
 will change the mass of your fat content to saturated from polyunsaturated even though

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.680
 we do produce some polyunsaturates ourselves.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:14:00.680
 And it's coming to be recognized that steric acid, purely saturated fatty acid has anti-cancer

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.680
 effects.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.120
 Yeah, it's just a matter of time hopefully, right?

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.920
 Okay, so you said that in an older person, just to recap here, that an elderly person

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:17.560
 has 50% less cholesterol in their skin and that they need twice the sunlight exposure

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:24.000
 to create the same amount of vitamin D. So obviously that's a big concern for, and I

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.680
 know people when they talk about people in nursing homes, we generally think about people

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:35.520
 that are well advanced, but besides the fact that they're not producing enough vitamin

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.840
 D, being indoors in a nursing home and not getting sunlight further compounds their chances

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:49.540
 of becoming susceptible to cancers as vitamin D has been shown repeatedly to be a good strategy

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.400
 for protecting against cancers.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.400
 And I know you've...

00:14:52.400 --> 00:15:00.120
 Just a couple of years ago there were experiments on hairless mice, exposing them to ultraviolet

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.960
 light and then giving them topical vitamin D.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.200
 Topical vitamin?

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:16.160
 And preventing the UV carcinogenesis by treating them after the exposure with vitamin D.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.160
 D, yeah.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.160
 Good, interesting.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:25.040
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Ob Doctor on KMU DeGarboville, 91.1 FM and from 7.30

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.320
 till the end of the show you're invited to call in with questions related to this month's

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:36.120
 topic of basically skin cancers, vitamin D and cholesterol and how we're going to explain

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:44.480
 here how they are all pulled in to produce a rationale for supporting good health.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.360
 The number if you live in the area is 707-923-3911.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:56.920
 Well, Dr. Peat, you've already touched on it lightly here without me asking you, but

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.920
 I looked at...

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:04.080
 While I was doing some background reading for this month's show here, I looked at the

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.080
 mevalonate pathway.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:14.920
 Now, you mentioned HMG-CoA reductase as an enzyme without explaining all the step-by-step

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:21.600
 formation of steroids and cholesterol from acetyl-CoA, which is a natural process and

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.760
 one that's extremely important for us.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.600
 You mentioned the enzyme.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:33.560
 Now, statins, just to try and bring this around back to a point of people can help cement

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.920
 the idea in their mind that cholesterol is not a bad molecule.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.920
 This mevalonate pathway and the production of cholesterol amongst many other compounds,

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:49.320
 including steroids, carotenoids, saponins, limonoids, etc., they're blocked by statins

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.080
 at this particular point in the pathway.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:58.520
 So another reason to avoid statins, and I know you've said many times, and I'll repeat

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.440
 it again because there's going to be people that have probably just heard this for the

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:08.480
 first time, but if you're over 50, you actually want a cholesterol more like 200, 210, 220.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.000
 It's actually protective.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.680
 But if you're taking statins to lower your cholesterol because it's supposedly too high

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:20.680
 and not good for you, which we've shown time and time again is actually bad science, using

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:27.200
 statins and blocking this enzyme will lead to a deficit in all those other steroids and

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.240
 all the other products from which cholesterol is a building block.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:39.200
 It's now gradually being realized that ubiquitin or coenzyme Q10, which is a product of that

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:46.560
 same enzyme, that the statins lower that and it's an essential component of the mitochondrial

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.640
 respiratory system.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:56.600
 And when a tissue is stressed, such as a muscle during exercise, the mitochondria fails to

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:03.160
 produce enough energy and that can lead to the breakdown of the muscle and sometimes

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:10.320
 the muscle breakdown plugs up the kidneys in effect and kills the person.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:18.040
 But very commonly it's causing muscle pain made worse by exercise.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:25.080
 And that's because of damage to the mitochondrial respiratory system mainly, although the structural

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:32.040
 effects of reduced cholesterol will affect the structure and function of mitochondria.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:41.880
 But since the brain and other organs use the same coenzyme Q10 and mitochondrial processes,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:51.120
 the muscle damage is just a very noticeable thing where the cognitive damage is less noticeable.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.880
 More cumulative.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:59.560
 You mentioned lactic acid obviously being a byproduct here and being very inflammatory.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:05.640
 Is that apart from this coQ10 decrease or is it in conjunction with it?

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:11.640
 It is a necessary adaptation to anything that impairs oxidation.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.000
 Okay.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:21.320
 So do you see any of the other steroid hormones or like I mentioned the carotenoids or saponins

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:29.400
 even or the liminoids part of the isoprenoid formation of essentially what we would term

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:35.240
 components like you would find in essential oils, the terpenes and terpenoids.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.320
 Is there anything there that you would see that would be...

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:45.000
 I suspect that even body odor will be affected by it because it's known that some of these

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:54.480
 perfumy chemicals made by that pathway are involved in the fragrance of a young person's

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.480
 skin oils.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:03.720
 And so I imagine it would tend to make a person lose their young fragrance.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.720
 Interesting.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.720
 Okay.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.720
 All right.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:12.080
 So I know that's serious from a health perspective but it's an interesting take on it.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:21.240
 Just an aside, what do you see as a direct link if you like or the way you understand

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.240
 it?

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.200
 I mean some people just don't smell good.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.840
 Some people you don't smell them.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:32.400
 They have no smell and they don't have to bath for two days, three days a week and they

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.400
 don't smell.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:38.200
 Other people have to bathe every day and you smell them and they smell bad.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:44.640
 Alexander the Great who apparently had great vitality in general, he was famous.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.160
 Historians wrote about how sweet he smelled.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:54.640
 People would collect his used garments because they had a permanent perfume infused into

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.640
 them.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.640
 Okay.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.080
 Do you see...

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.920
 Everyone under stress can emit different chemicals.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.960
 For example, isoprene tends to show up during nighttime stress.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.960
 Oh really?

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.960
 Okay.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.960
 All right.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.360
 So how else do you see body odor?

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:21.640
 I mean apart from the kind of medical definitions of just bacterial breakdown, yeast and byproducts

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.640
 of that kind of thing.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:31.880
 In a healthy person, the skin under the influence of thyroid hormone and feedback from the progesterone

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:39.480
 which is produced in the skin from the cholesterol, insulin and thyroid hormone are very important

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:46.880
 for keeping the flow going from energy through cholesterol into the steroids.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:59.080
 And then those steroids include among some of the minor androgens, the pheromones, the

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:09.400
 sex attracting steroids both in men and women, some of the testosterone related minor androgens

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:18.400
 create a perfume that is very closely associated with high production of the steroids.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.400
 Okay.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.080
 So you call it perfume.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:27.080
 Would you also describe it as a musk or a disagreeable smell though?

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:34.240
 Presumably attraction should be preceded by something pleasant, right?

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.240
 Yeah.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:44.960
 Many people aren't aware of smells but experiments show that they're influenced in their judgment

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.640
 about a person by the smells on their skin.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.640
 Interesting.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:58.440
 I'm only saying this because I come from a perspective of still somewhat kind of medically

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:06.800
 brainwashed but in terms of the liver and its process for deaminating and breaking down

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:12.920
 toxins and making them ready for excretion because we don't want them building up because

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.880
 they're toxins.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.720
 Is there any link perhaps to liver dysfunction?

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.760
 Oh yeah.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:29.480
 When the liver is failing, the fats that should be breaking down and excreting can come out

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.280
 in the breath.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.280
 On the breath, okay.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.280
 Yeah.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.200
 But how about in a generalized body odor?

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.560
 Oh yeah.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:42.960
 Acutely they show up in the breath just for example when you get hungry, if your liver

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:51.280
 isn't efficient, things in your tissues will come out in your exhaled breath but chronically

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.680
 they accumulate and come out more gradually in the oils.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.680
 That's funny.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:03.080
 We call this death breath and you find it on children too and in fact our five year

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:09.640
 old, you know, if we haven't made sure that she's, because she's so active, I mean she's

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:15.480
 very, she's bright, she's intelligent, she's fast, I think she burns a lot of calories

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:21.200
 and if we don't constantly feed her then the day before or the evening before, she'll wake

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.960
 up in the morning and she'll have this smell on her that's obviously the process by which

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.960
 you've described and she doesn't have it when we're really conscious about making sure she

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.200
 gets plenty of sugars during that day and in the evening she has a sugary snack and

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.520
 then she's totally fine, you don't smell it, it's night and day.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:48.880
 And yeah, that smell can precede, for example, an epileptic seizure or just other, like a

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:55.760
 migraine, headache, anything where the blood sugar is inadequate and the stress hormones

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.760
 break down tissues.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.760
 Okay, interesting.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:04.320
 All right, well it's 7.26 and the phone lines have been ringing here and we do have, I've

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.600
 been told we do have a couple of people ready to step in, so let's just take this, we've

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.760
 got plenty more things I want to ask you about, but let's, I know that the show really is

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.920
 about exposing you and I like it when people call up and they ask you stuff and they challenge

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.040
 you to think about the way you think about it, so let's take this first caller.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.040
 Caller, you on the air?

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.080
 Hi, my name's Chris and I'm calling from Southern Humboldt.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.680
 And the first thing I want to add to your little discussion here about fragrance is

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:35.760
 I had a friend who was a monk and he was a Tibetan monk but he was actually English and

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:45.880
 he was quite cultivated and anyway, he was eating, I'm trying to think, rose petals.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.080
 And he smelled wonderful.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.360
 I mean he was probably like Alexander, so maybe that was the secret.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.840
 But what I wanted to talk to you about, Dr. Peat, was I don't know if you remember me

00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.760
 or not, I know you talk to a lot of people, but I talked to you, I inquired with you about

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.760
 monk fruit sugar.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.760
 Do you remember?

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.760
 Oh yeah.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.760
 Okay.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:10.680
 Well I've done a lot of research on it so far and I'm even trying to get the local community

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:16.800
 college to possibly start to grow monk fruit sugar as a research product.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.880
 But anyway, the wonderful thing about the monk fruit sugar is in China, it's the reason

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:26.160
 Chinese people don't get fat because they don't eat table sugar like we eat, they don't

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:32.120
 eat cane sugar, they're eating monk fruit sugar exclusively and believe it or not, they've

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.960
 been using it for, as long as there's been Chinese people on the planet, I don't know

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:41.080
 how long that's been, but they've used it for controlling diabetes.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:47.640
 In fact, it's absolutely wonderful for that and I've done some research for you guys.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:54.600
 The reduction of the inflammation and oxidation, if monk fruit is administered regularly, like

00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:02.560
 half a teaspoon every day, you will reduce or eliminate inflammation and oxidation entirely.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.560
 Absolutely.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:12.440
 Well Dr. Peat, obviously both you and I and lots of people that we consult with and do the

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.600
 same thing are big advocates of regular white table sugar.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:24.440
 What do you have to say about monk fruit sugar and how would you see this being a positive

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.680
 and anti-diabetes type?

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:35.760
 I actually think any sugar, but especially fruit sugar, any sugar is a good treatment

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:46.840
 for diabetes because glucose is a promoter of stem cell renewal in the pancreas and it

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:54.480
 opposes, tends to suppress the free fatty acids which are produced under stress and

00:27:54.480 --> 00:28:02.000
 the free fatty acids are constantly killing the beta cells in the pancreas every time

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.840
 they regenerate under the influence of glucose.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:14.600
 If there isn't enough glucose to suppress the free fatty acids, then regenerated beta

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.040
 cells get killed again.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:24.160
 So keeping the fatty acids down is the essence of curing diabetes and any kind of fruit,

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.200
 if you eat enough of it.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:34.360
 Can I please inquire and ask you, I beseech you, please look into, it's called Lu Hong

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:44.560
 Go, L-U-O-H-A-N-G-U-O, that's its Mandarin name in China, and Lu Hong Go is monk fruit.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.360
 Please do some research on this because I really think it's going to help a lot of people

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.120
 that have diabetes and I think it's really going to help a lot of people that have problems

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.120
 with chronic inflammation.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.280
 And that's all I have to say.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.280
 Have a great night.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.280
 Okay, thank you for your call.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.040
 Engineer, you said that you...

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:07.200
 I just did a really quick little research and there is about 35% fructose and sucrose

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:14.360
 in it, but there's actually a chemical they're calling, it's a triterpene glycoside, a saponin

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.840
 triterpene glycoside that gives a lot of the fruit, the sweetness, and that's a powder

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.760
 they extract and concentrate.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.960
 So I suspect it's more like stevia than an actual fructose.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.520
 So Dr. Peat, knowing what you know, if you've looked at monk fruit sugar, do you have anything

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:36.600
 else to say about it as a substance and/or the direct comparison to glucose or sucrose

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.960
 or fructose, obviously?

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.560
 No, I haven't seen any comparisons of it in diabetes.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.960
 Yeah, well, no problem.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.640
 Okay, well, we have another caller on the air.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.720
 So caller, you're on the air, where are you from and what's your question?

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.120
 I'm from New York.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:57.640
 Dr. Peat, I spoke before as well as a prior caller and it's consistent, following up on

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.040
 the recommendation you mentioned, but it's consistent what you were talking about with

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:05.880
 vitamin D. I had a skin rash and I had been prescribed cortisol creams and all kinds

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.440
 of stuff for lots of side effects, decided not to do that.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:15.240
 I asked you about it and you had recommended salt and baking soda bath, like a pound each

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.240
 daily.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:24.720
 And I think you also mentioned vitamin D. In addition to that, I did take a high volume,

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:36.160
 like 50 billion units of not just acidophilus, but a mixed variety of those types of products.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.760
 And it got better, but it took like five months.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.240
 It is coming back now.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.600
 You also had mentioned, but very minor way.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.280
 And so I have two questions about that.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.080
 One, you'd mentioned vitamin D as well, and not so much vitamin A. I did get a vitamin

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:57.960
 D test and it was 39, which it's not dangerous, but it's low.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:04.320
 And I am older, over 60.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.000
 So I was just wondering what is it that I could do to get that vitamin D level up, even

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.040
 though I'm applying it topically, the sun doesn't seem to work and trying to overcome

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.880
 the point she made at the outset of this particular show.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.280
 That's the first part.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:23.400
 The second part is when they gave me cortisol, I was thinking the adrenal glands make cortisol,

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.400
 right?

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.160
 So if you get older and your adrenal glands are "less efficient" for the reasons you mentioned

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.480
 earlier, is that why they're suggesting topical cortisol?

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.800
 Because you can't make enough yourself.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:38.680
 And if that's the case, it seems to me you would want to take adrenal hormones to more

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.840
 rejuvenate your adrenal glands so that you can make your own cortisol and let your body

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.200
 decide how much to make and where to repair.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.560
 So it's the vitamin D and the adrenal glands.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:53.000
 It did heal, took a very long time, but it is actually coming back now.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.520
 So I'm wondering about those two points.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:02.480
 Have you tried any supplements like a DHEA or progesterone or pregnenolone?

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.400
 Well, you know, I took pregnenolone.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:15.080
 It actually is great, but I just don't know whether it affects my body's ability to produce

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.080
 it.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.840
 Obviously, you feel great right away.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:23.440
 You've mentioned that in the past, but I just don't know how it dynamically affects other

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:29.360
 hormones and whether or not it's actually making testosterone or converting to estrogen

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.760
 because I do run a little bit and frankly, I did run today.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:39.480
 It's funny you mentioned this also about the damage you can do by running and afterward,

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.480
 I did actually take some COQ10.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:46.240
 Coincidentally, I don't know why I did it, but then to have you say it and I thought,

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.520
 "Wow, that's interesting that you said that.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.640
 Maybe that's a good idea if you're going to run, even if it's just a little bit, just

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.040
 to keep the blood flowing."

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:57.960
 Taking COQ10 seems to make sense as sort of a defensive measure because there are some

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:02.880
 benefits of running, which I know you don't espouse, but it's important for me.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:09.160
 Obviously, you want to do it in a way that reduces the damage.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.360
 I have taken it.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.960
 I do have topical progesterone.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.200
 Being a man, I don't do a lot of it.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:22.320
 I have DHEA and I've taken out a little bit, but I'm just not sure how to take them and

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:27.520
 what quantity, how often, and how they would interact with what my body's trying to do.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:31.680
 So I kind of have them, but I'm not actually sure how to use them, to be honest.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.080
 Have you checked your thyroid function?

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:41.240
 Well, I do take 30 milligrams of the thyroid, but I do the natural desiccated for the same

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.840
 reasons I just mentioned.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:47.120
 It does have some liver in it, so I don't know if that's a problem, but I do take it.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.880
 My temperature was great during the summer.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.560
 I know you've mentioned this before.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.240
 I mean, it was much better.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.400
 Now it's actually a little bit lower.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:58.760
 I'm finding it in the morning in the low 97s.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:05.400
 So I try to get to 97.6 or 7 or 8 in the morning, but I'm a little bit, about a half a degree

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.280
 lower than that.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.960
 So I could increase it, but you're not depressed.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.320
 Your energy's not lower and I can get my energy up.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.440
 The red light helps.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.640
 Dry CO2 is phenomenal.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:24.840
 But yeah, I think I have, I definitely have a weaker thyroid and probably running hurts

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.840
 it.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.720
 Other things hurt it, but I try to stick to your diet to minimize the risk.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.880
 Carrots hurt it too, by the way.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.600
 I think I have my blood sugar drops when I take that carrot.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.920
 It may help my stomach, but it hurts my thyroid function, but it goes away.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:37.920
 It goes away.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:44.560
 So the answer is yes, I do take a little bit of thyroid, but only 30 milligrams or one

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.560
 grain.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.600
 I could up it to two, but the question is when do you take that during the day?

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.600
 Do you do it always in the morning?

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.600
 Do you do it at night?

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.600
 How do you spread it out?

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:56.840
 How does it affect my ability of my own thyroid to determine how much it needs and when it

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.840
 needs it?

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.920
 All right, well, let's let Dr. Peat answer what it is that you've asked and thanks for your

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:02.920
 question.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.440
 So we got a question about the vitamin D status.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.400
 I think you said it was 36, did you?

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.400
 Or 39?

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.840
 36, I think.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:16.600
 And then cortisol, obviously concerned about adrenal production.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:27.320
 So Dr. Peat. Thyroid is essential for making all of these steroids and in a young person,

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:38.560
 the ratio when you're under stress, there's a lot of cortisol produced and that will,

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:47.400
 in a healthy person, that will also increase the cholesterol, pregnenolone, DHEA and progesterone

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.080
 backing up the cortisol.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:58.680
 But with age, there's a constant decrease in the ratio of DHEA and the protective steroids

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.600
 in relation to cortisol.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:09.640
 So that even though your average cortisol might stay the same with aging, in effect,

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.560
 it's becoming constantly more active.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:20.200
 You're more susceptible to side effects from the cortisol exposure because your DHEA, pregnenolone

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:26.560
 and progesterone are going down constantly with aging along with the decreasing cholesterol

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.560
 in all of the tissues.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:37.800
 Okay, I think just a mention here that everybody is very variable in their absorption of vitamin

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:45.080
 D and for some people, you know, 2000 or 4000 IU a day is fine to keep their vitamin D up

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.920
 around 40, 45, 50.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.920
 Some other people use 10,000 IU a day and it does depend.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:58.240
 I think weight is a factor that can lower the absorption of it, somebody's body weight.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:03.680
 But basically using vitamin D as a supplement is probably one of the best ways to get it.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:08.520
 Part of this month's show, we were going to discuss the actual production of it.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:15.120
 But basically you get 90% or so of your vitamin D if you're not supplementing from the sunlight.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.360
 So if you're really not in the sun that much and we're going to talk about the scale here

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.240
 of vitamin D that's produced by sunlight versus the cancers.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:32.360
 Topical or internal use of a vitamin D compound either in a thorn research, do it, life extension,

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.840
 do it, Carlson Labs do it, you know, there's plenty of it available and it's not expensive.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:42.240
 But to get your vitamin D in the 50 nanogram per mil range is a very good strategy for

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.840
 maintaining good health.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.520
 But let's just take this next caller.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.120
 Next caller, you're on the air, where are you from?

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.120
 Where's your question?

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.120
 I'm Mike from Connecticut.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.120
 Hey Mike, what's your question?

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:59.760
 Yes, I just wanted to know, repeat the thoughts on the skin care bacteria and the role they

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.760
 play in health.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:05.680
 Is it like what's in the gut where you want to keep the bacteria at a minimum?

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:11.760
 And if so, is the UV a good treatment for killing the bacteria in the skin?

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:16.120
 And just wondering if there's other ways to balance that.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:22.160
 I find that UV treatment has actually been quite potent to treat my acne.

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:26.720
 And I'm just wondering if that's something that's valuable for UV or if there's other

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.960
 ways like red light or any other way of controlling the bad bacteria in the skin.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.240
 Yeah, I had a little trouble hearing the very first thing you said, but did you say carini

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:39.720
 bacterium as in the bacteria that cause acne?

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.720
 And carcinogenesis?

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.720
 Yes.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.560
 Both of you cut in, I couldn't hear that.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.560
 He said yes.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.560
 Yes, okay good.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:53.200
 So Dr. Peat, did you get the question there?

00:38:53.200 --> 00:39:03.920
 Yeah, I think thyroid and vitamin D are major factors in the immunity.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:17.920
 There's another cholesterol metabolite, 25-hydroxycholesterol, which is very similar in function to 25-hydroxyvitamin

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:25.040
 D. They're very structurally similar and they both activate the immune system.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:33.840
 And I think they work right along with vitamin A and the thyroid hormone in keeping the immune

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.840
 system, the skin bacteria under control.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.040
 Okay, thank you for your question.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.040
 So we're live here in 2-8 o'clock.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:48.280
 If people would like to call in with any questions related to this month's topic of skin cancer,

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.840
 vitamin D, cholesterol and how they interplay, the number here is 707-923-3911.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:40:00.400
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, I've got lots more questions, so we'll see how far we get in terms of people

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.400
 calling in or not.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:11.880
 I wanted to know whether or not vitamin D would be a useful topical treatment, maybe

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.360
 not directly on a suspicious skin lesions, but maybe adjacent.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:21.400
 Like I know you mentioned progesterone shouldn't be typically topically put on, but adjacent

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:26.880
 to an area and then let the product migrate, which it will do through the skin.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:32.120
 But do you think that a topical application of vitamin D with a saturated fat, either

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:38.480
 coconut oil or something like that would be a reasonable approach to improving the vitamin

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.240
 D status in the skin?

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:46.240
 Because I know they interplay between cholesterol and skin cancers.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.920
 There's a definite causal link between vitamin D cholesterol levels in the skin and the formation

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.920
 of skin cancers.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.920
 So do you think...

00:40:52.920 --> 00:41:04.120
 Yeah, I think both vitamin D and cholesterol, especially with saturated fats to compete

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:09.520
 against whatever polyunsaturated happens to be in the skin.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:22.880
 I think all three of those have a good chance of overcoming the precancerous condition.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:33.960
 In a typical cancer, there will be a fully cancerized zone surrounded by lower degrees

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:43.760
 of conversion of the cells as if something is being emitted from a center causing gradual

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.840
 progressive change in the surrounding tissue.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:55.600
 It isn't that cells are traveling out, it's that the surrounding normal cells are gradually

00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:00.960
 being injured the closer they are to the cancer.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:08.720
 And part of that is that the normal metabolites are being suppressed by the toxins such as

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.080
 lactic acid being emitted by the cancer cells.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:23.560
 And fairly well saturating the skin both from the bloodstream internally taken supplements

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:33.880
 but also from things applied topically in the vicinity are going to keep those precancerous

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:39.120
 cells from going the rest of the way and increasing the tumor.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:47.800
 And about 20 years ago, someone was taking samples from facial skin of people who were

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:56.960
 just normally exposed to daylight and they found that almost everyone with any outside

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:05.560
 light exposure had quite a few mutated cells, precancerous cells in their facial skin.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:12.720
 But when they covered the skin for just a few weeks, that same area that had been producing

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:24.440
 streams of mutated cells were entirely free of mutant cells showing that the body is able

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:32.640
 to kill off the bad cells and replace them with fresh non-cancerous cells given the chance

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:37.720
 of just letting them simply rest from the damage.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:44.920
 Presumably this would be in instances perhaps where there wasn't severe and repeated sunburn

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:54.320
 as a direct cause of mutated DNA but which is a very slight irritation that's not such

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.320
 a severe...

00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:04.920
 Yeah, and other people looking at middle-aged people who had been killed in accidents found

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:12.680
 that everyone at the age of 50, if you did a thorough autopsy, everyone has cancer by

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.720
 the age of 50 somewhere in their body.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:19.700
 Same principle as they saw in the facial skin.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:26.360
 If you stop injuring it, it's going to return to normal.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:32.800
 Most people don't die of cancer even though everyone by the age of 50 has cancer.

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:42.440
 So the thing is to stop making cancers in your body as far as possible and I think that's

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:52.080
 the function of applying things such as progesterone, vitamin D, cholesterol, maybe mevalonic acid.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.440
 I want to ask you about that in a little bit but we do have another caller so let's take

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.440
 this caller.

00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.240
 Caller, you're on the air, where are you from and what's your question?

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:04.480
 My name's Chris and I'm here in Humboldt County.

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:11.000
 And I apologize in advance if I'm basically asking the same question someone else already

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.360
 has, I just turned on the radio.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:19.680
 I love your guys' show so I appreciate the time you guys put in for it.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.080
 I'm a white 51-year-old.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:29.000
 I grew up in Southern California getting baked on the beach.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:36.040
 I have been severely sunburned several, many times as a kid.

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:45.800
 And then within the last 10 years I've kind of fought skin cancer a little bit.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:51.880
 It's not the melanoma, it's the mesothermal or whatever.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.760
 A basal cell calcinoma or squamous cell?

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.400
 I think it's the meso maybe.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.400
 It's supposed to be a less aggressive one.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.760
 Well, actinic keratosis is the start of it I think.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.440
 Yeah, so that's the thing.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:12.560
 I've gotten to where I can kind of recognize it.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:22.840
 And I've had a couple spots cut off and then I was called back in to cut off some more

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:26.040
 because they found it around the periphery.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:33.160
 And basically what I'm kind of noticing is that it's basically all over.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.760
 There's tiny little spots.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:41.480
 Maybe it's pre-cancer or whatever, but it's like, well, you try to cut all that stuff

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.800
 off, I won't have any skin.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:51.400
 So I'm kind of wondering what you guys would recommend what I should do or maybe even direct

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:57.640
 me towards, I don't know if it's on your website, some literature that I should do some research.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.640
 Sure.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:03.040
 Dr. Peat, okay, so what would you suggest for this 51-year-old Southern Californian

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.400
 who's been burnt severely several times?

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:12.680
 His description of the process reminded me of another person in Southern California who

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.820
 had cancer on his ear.

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:21.480
 The doctor said he was going to have to cut off his ear to cure the cancer.

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:26.160
 And the guy didn't want to cut off his ear and so he put, I think it was progesterone

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:29.880
 or a mixture of progesterone and DHEA on it.

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:34.520
 And a week or two later, he said it fell off.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.280
 I said, "What, the ear?"

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.280
 He said, "No, the cancer."

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.280
 Progesterone and DHEA.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.280
 What's that other one?

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.280
 DHEA.

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.280
 DHEA.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:48.880
 Now, I just want to put the caveat out there, and Dr. Peat, you'll agree with this because

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:55.120
 you're the one who stated it, but in terms of using DHEA, you need to make sure that

00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.520
 your thyroid's working well, otherwise you've run the risk of converting that DHEA into

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:06.000
 estrogen, which you don't want to do because that in its own right is a pro-cancerous compound.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:13.920
 So make sure your thyroid function is working well and/or, if it isn't, use a thyroid hormone.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:20.240
 So whether it's desiccated natural or indeed synthetic, which is absolutely fine, you should

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:25.760
 be making sure that your thyroid's working well so that you can convert that DHEA appropriately.

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:32.480
 And sometimes skin cancers heal up just for increasing the thyroid because the thyroid

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:41.440
 is going to increase the production of cholesterol and the immune steroids.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:47.280
 I guess that would require a visit to the doctor to check out my thyroid function or

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.280
 something.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.280
 Well, you could.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.920
 Here's the thing, though.

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.240
 You will probably find...

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.240
 Well, you know what?

00:48:55.240 --> 00:49:01.680
 It's a good idea to get a metabolic panel done and see what your TSH is like.

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:06.960
 I found a lot of people have really overt symptoms of low thyroid, which improve dramatically

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:11.600
 with thyroid hormone when their labs come back showing that their TSH is within the

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.600
 normal range.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:16.840
 So that in and of itself is not diagnostic.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.360
 Your temperature and pulses will be a very good way to see what your metabolic rate is,

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:29.840
 which is the underlying driver of your metabolism and hormone conversion, etc.

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.880
 You can get a blood test to see what your TSH is like.

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.980
 It might be fairly high.

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:37.480
 So that would be clinically a way to show that.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:41.320
 But your temperature and pulses would be the best way to do that.

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.320
 Okay.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:49.720
 And is the DHEA and progesterone, is that something someone can just go pick up?

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.440
 Yeah, they're both non-prescription.

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:57.520
 Both DHEA and progesterone are both non-prescription.

00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.520
 They're dietary supplements, basically.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.520
 Okay, awesome.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.520
 All right.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.520
 Thank you, guys.

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.520
 Yeah, you're welcome.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.160
 If you want to, you can always email me.

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:11.920
 I'll send you a link to some resources that you can look at and indeed links where you

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.120
 can buy quality products.

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:21.360
 Broda Barnes was the person who showed how effective the temperature check could be for

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.640
 diagnosing hypothyroidism.

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:29.000
 And his books are still available on the Internet, I think.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.520
 Very important to read for everyone.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.520
 There you go.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.520
 Broda Barnes.

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.520
 Okay.

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.520
 We have two callers.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.920
 So let's see if we can squeeze them in for the next at least eight minutes.

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.680
 Caller number one, where are you from?

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:41.680
 What's your question?

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.440
 Can we try and be as concise as we can?

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.960
 I'm from Long Island.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:51.160
 And you mentioned skin, but vitamin E wasn't mentioned.

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.040
 And I know there's vitamin E and tocotrienols.

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:59.440
 And I was just wondering which one is preferable and how would you use them in the context

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.960
 of this dialogue?

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:05.640
 The second question I have is royal jelly versus bee pollen.

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:11.000
 Are those the same thing and are they recommended or too much poofa?

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 Thank you.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 Okay.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 Thanks for your call.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.680
 So did you hear the first question about the vitamin E?

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.680
 Yeah.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:29.280
 There is some information that the tocotrienols can enlarge doses in experimental animals.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:37.800
 They cause liver enlargement, which suggests that they're treated as a toxin by the liver.

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:47.040
 And so ever since seeing that, I've been suspicious that maybe they're overemphasizing their value

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:54.000
 because of the amount of money they can sell them for as distinct from a traditional vitamin

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:05.480
 E. And one of the problems with vitamin E is it can preserve the amount of poofa in

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:11.880
 the tissue, so it's important to keep your polyunsaturated fats down as well as using

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:16.160
 the vitamin E to block their effects as far as possible.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.160
 Okay.

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.440
 So very quickly, the royal jelly versus the pollen aspect.

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:25.000
 I know you don't really agree with bee pollen because of the possible allergenic effects

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.520
 given that it's collected from such a wide range of plants.

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.200
 What about royal jelly?

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:34.880
 I know that's a fair amount of press.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:40.240
 It's extremely rich in nutrients and if there was a lot of it, everyone should probably

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.240
 eat some of it.

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:45.160
 But you don't want to steal the bees' food.

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.160
 They're already having problems.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.160
 That's right.

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.160
 I know.

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.160
 All right.

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.160
 Without going any further, we have two more callers.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.160
 Let's take this next caller.

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.160
 Caller, you're on the air.

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.160
 Where are you from?

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.160
 Yeah.

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.160
 Hi.

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.160
 I'm from Redway, California.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.160
 Hey, what's your question?

00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:02.080
 Well, I have a question and an observation first.

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:07.880
 My 97-year-old grandmother recently was diagnosed with a squamous cell carcinoma on her nose.

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:12.640
 The doctors were saying, "Look, you're going to croak before you think you'll..."

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.640
 But it was annoying to her.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:14.640
 So she's like...

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.880
 And they said, "Well, we're going to have to cut your whole nose off basically to get

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.880
 at it."

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:18.880
 And so we tried...

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:19.880
 What kind of cancer was it?

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.880
 It was a squamous cell carcinoma.

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:23.880
 Yes.

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:30.960
 I've had several old friends and myself with little cancers on the face that they went

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:40.160
 away in from as little as a week to six months of applying progesterone or DHEA to them.

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.520
 And a friend who was...

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:50.640
 I think she was 94 at the time, her face was being eaten away by a melanoma.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:59.160
 And just a few applications of progesterone nearby, there was a hole so that she couldn't

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.960
 put it directly in the melanoma.

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:02.960
 But...

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:09.520
 Well, I have another question for you, which is that we applied cannabis oil as an alternative

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.160
 method and found efficacy within two weeks.

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:16.280
 I mean, and so she had it for about four months, four or five months.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:19.400
 And when I started telling people about this, they advised me, they said, "Look, you know,

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.400
 that's anecdotal.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.800
 Don't go around telling people that cannabis oil cures cancer.

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:28.360
 You know, it is weird as not doing traditional medicines and favoring the...

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.360
 You guys...

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.360
 I mean, but this happened to my kid.

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.000
 Now, like you said, maybe it went away on its own.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.240
 It was a coincidence that we applied that oil.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.240
 That could be.

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.720
 And I just turned to the show, so I don't really know what you guys have been talking

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.480
 about that much.

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:43.280
 But I would like to get your thoughts, since you guys both need to be medical professionals,

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:47.920
 on the potential efficacy of cannabis oil, whether it should or should not be administered

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.320
 and what results other people are finding with it.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.920
 Do you have any thoughts on that?

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.920
 Yeah, I'm afraid I don't.

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:59.880
 The only thing I would wonder, was the product...

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.680
 What kind of oil was the product extracted in, or was it just...

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.680
 Olive oil.

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.680
 Olive oil, right.

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:05.680
 It was basically hash.

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.760
 It was basically hashish mixed with olive oil, to get onto it, what it was.

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:14.160
 I think the olive oil is more therapeutic than the cannabis oil.

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.160
 I heard somebody say that, too.

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:16.160
 They said, "You know, you don't know me.

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.160
 It was the olive oil."

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:28.240
 Olive oil is another thing that people have used successfully on skin cancers, to squash

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.440
 the yellow leaf on the...

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:37.960
 It was shocking to know that the doctor basically had no thoughts that he would look...

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:43.840
 The doctor she went to was saying the only real remedy here for his excision, cut the

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:44.840
 nose off.

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.840
 Obviously, she didn't want to do that.

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.320
 But it's encouraging to note that there are other...

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:54.040
 Well, for anybody listening to the show, that we could...

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.680
 What you guys have been talking about.

00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:04.520
 The oleic acid, which is the major fat in olive oil, it increases synthesis of cholesterol.

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:07.120
 Well, that's great.

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:12.840
 I mean, so olive oil, I mean, wow.

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:16.760
 I appreciate your input, Caller.

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:17.760
 Thanks for your call.

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:18.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:19.760
 Thanks for doing the show.

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:20.760
 Yeah, you're welcome.

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:24.520
 It's a couple of minutes to eight, so I'll let you sign off, Dr. Peat.

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:27.680
 Thanks so much for doing the show, as you always...

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.360
 I say always have.

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:33.760
 I can't remember when you last didn't, but thanks so much for your time.

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.760
 Okay.

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:38.400
 Okay, so we probably only got through about half of what I wanted to get through, but

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:39.400
 that's always good.

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.000
 I always like it when people call in.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 It shows that people are listening and they're interested.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.520
 And even when they sometimes don't call in very much, I get feedback on the internet

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:53.080
 from the Ray Peat Forum, et cetera, just seeing just how many people are actually listening

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.880
 to it and wanting to actually hear what Ray Peat's got to say rather than other people.

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.880
 So it's always a catch-22.

00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:03.600
 I know Dr. Peat likes to be engaged with people calling up, and I know people like to hear

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.680
 what Dr. Peat has to say.

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:09.160
 So for those who called in, thanks for your time and your questions.

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:13.040
 For those who've not heard about Dr. Peat or maybe only just listened to him once or

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:21.120
 twice on the show, he's been doing this, like I said, for 45 plus years now, and a PhD endocrinologist

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:23.100
 who actually practices what he preaches.

00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:25.400
 So that's the big difference there.

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:34.960
 His website is www.raypeat.com, and he's got plenty of scholarly articles that are fully

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:39.480
 referenced and will give you a very different perspective on things that you've been told

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:41.520
 are the way they are.

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:46.400
 And fortunately, they are not the way they are, but they are alternatives.

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:55.320
 And for those people who also want to take a look at our website, it's www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:57:55.320 --> 00:58:00.280
 And on the Resources tab, there are audio files from all of the shows that we've ever

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.720
 done.

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.400
 There are probably about eight months' worth that still need to get put up from this year,

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:09.720
 but we're working hard in the background to get this done.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:15.440
 And also on YouTube, there are most of our radio shows on YouTube.

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:20.880
 So thanks so much for the callers, and until the third Friday of next month, have a good

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:24.560
 night and welcome to the rain in southern Humboldt anyway.

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.600
 Okay, good night.

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:35.600
