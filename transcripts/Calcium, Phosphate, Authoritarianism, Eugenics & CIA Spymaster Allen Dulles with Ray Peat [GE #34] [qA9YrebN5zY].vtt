00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:23.640
 - Hello everyone, I'm Danny Roddy of DannyRoddy.com

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.560
 and today I'm talking with painter, philosopher,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.920
 biologist, Raymond Peat.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.080
 In this hour long episode, we'll talk about calcium

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.760
 as the cause and solution to many health problems,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.040
 why an excess of phosphorus is a serious source of stress,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.040
 in addition to talking about libertarianism,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.480
 the power elite's obsession with eugenics,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.400
 and the prominent role of CIA fascist spymaster,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.000
 Allen Dulles, in shaping the world we live in today.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 In addition to thanking Ray for talking with me today,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 I'd like to thank my patrons for making this show

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.960

 As always, please do your own research

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.540
 and come to your own conclusions

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.840
 and in the spirit of William Blake,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.640
 the true method of knowledge is experiment.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.440
 Without further ado, here's the show.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.020
 (upbeat music)

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.480
 - But maybe if I could just read you this Adele Davis quote

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.560
 that you had in your calcium article as a starter,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.840
 but she says, "It is extremely important to realize

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.320
 "that calcium deposits in soft tissues

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.660
 "become worse when the diet is low in calcium.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.880
 "Persons suffering from arthritis, bursitis, scleroderma,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.200
 "hardening of the arteries, and any abnormality

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.940
 "where calcium deposits or spurs may cause pain

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.380
 "are often afraid to eat foods rich in calcium.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.740
 "Actually, they can never improve

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.660
 "until their calcium and magnesium intakes are adequate,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.940
 "and that inspired my email to you

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.520
 "about doing this episode of,"

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.720
 I think you had mentioned it in some podcast,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.980
 "of the idea that calcium is not only the solution

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.620
 "to many of the health problems,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.280
 "but it's also the cause of many of the health problems."

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.880
 And so I think maybe that gets into David McCarron's work,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.160
 but I thought that was like a interesting concept

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.960
 that was probably of fundamental importance to understand.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.200
 - Yeah, and that was 50 years ago

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.300
 that she wrote that, at least.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.040
 And that's just horrifying to see

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.560
 how the medical journals now,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.080
 about 80 or 90% of the people talking about calcium,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.640
 at least 90%, completely miss that information

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.120
 that she had back in 1960.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.720
 - And you think that's possibly an extension

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.840
 of just this incorrect view of the cell?

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.520
 Is that how they are getting it so wrong?

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.960
 - Yeah, I don't think she knew anything about Gilbert Ling,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.920
 but she did read that that's the difference.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.800
 She was reading stuff in general

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.800
 and just accumulating information.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.280
 That is what you have to conclude,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.640
 even without knowing the principles

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.640
 of the gel nature of cytoplasm and how gels work,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.280
 what pH does to a gel and its affinity for minerals.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.440
 But that work had been going on for 20 or 30 years

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.600
 before Gilbert Ling wrote his stuff.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.400
 And so it was in the culture and people just staying awake,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.720
 just like Adele Davis accumulated it by reading nutrition.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.960
 - You frequently mention David McCarron

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.360
 and reference his articles,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.120
 and he has a slew of articles

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.960
 in I think the late '80s and '90s.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.520
 Was his work not respected or was it not acknowledged?

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.800
 - He got fired from California University,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.680
 I think UC Berkeley, and went to Oregon,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.760
 where they were too backward to see how dangerous he was.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.200
 - And the dangerous message

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.800
 was the calcium antihypertensive effect?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.520
 - Yeah, stop talking about salt

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.520
 and giving people diuretics.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.320
 The medical business had been killing them

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.160
 already for 30 years.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.540
 And when he said that it's calcium deficiency,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.800
 not sodium excess,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.760
 and they had to fire him and send him to the backwoods.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.640
 - You mentioned the gel-like nature of the cell.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.280
 Can I read you a little summary of the cell,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.020
 and then you can stop me if I'm horribly wrong?

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.320
 It's very simple,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.400
 but it might be good just to nail down some things

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.760
 or like terms or a glossary.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.960
 So if there's sufficient thyroid,

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.960
 ATP is the final end product

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.960
 of the food materials we consume.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.560
 The healthy resting state, ATP polarizes a cell,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.400
 meaning that it sustains the protein water solute structure,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.960
 preferentially absorbing potassium and magnesium

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.480
 and naturally excluding sodium and calcium.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.680
 And then the depletion of ATP

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.680
 leads to the depolarized state where a cell is vulnerable.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.400
 And then the depletion of ATP,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.760
 it also breaks down into ADP,

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.240
 like a lower energy molecule.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.080
 And you lose the complex of magnesium with ATP,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.440
 and you also lose phosphate.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.520
 And then the ADP complexes with calcium.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.500
 And then this is the general state

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.500
 that leads to the reductive stress,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.780
 the low carbon dioxide, the high lactic acid,

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.160
 and then the shift in the intracellular

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.640
 and extracellular pH.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.400
 - And meanwhile, things are streaming,

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.520
 oxygen and sugar are streaming in,

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.680
 and CO2 is streaming out,

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.920
 dragging the unnecessary minerals with it.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.160
 - The switch between the polarized and depolarized,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.080
 is that a natural phenomenon,

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.720
 or should a cell not necessarily need to shift

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.760
 into that disorderly water depolarized state?

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.280
 - Gilbert Ling showed that when he poisoned

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.280
 the energy producing systems, glycolysis and oxidation,

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.200
 that cells retained their polarization

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.420
 for longer than 24 hours,

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.680
 just sitting there essentially dead.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.480
 And meanwhile, sodium and calcium were bouncing in the cell

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.360
 and bouncing right back out again,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.880
 so they kept their polarization despite the motion

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.200
 across the surface and into the near regions

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.320
 of the cytoplasm and then back out.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.920
 - I haven't looked at that paper for a long time.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.880
 It was always semi confusing,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.880
 because if he's doing a stress test

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.680
 or energy depletion of the cell,

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.240
 how is it not becoming depolarized?

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.120
 - He didn't excite them, he kept them quiet.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.120
 And they were reptile cells that could stand being cold,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.800
 so he kept them cold so that there wasn't

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.160
 depletion of the energy.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.560
 The energy just stayed there, stuck to the proteins.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.640
 - I had written to him a long time ago,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.040
 asking him about carbon dioxide as a cardinal adsorbent.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.340
 I think he had mentioned that more research was needed

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.580
 or something similar.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.360
 But you see the carbon dioxide as something essential

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.600
 for maintaining the resting living state or the polarized.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.260
 - Yeah, I asked him something about carbon dioxide

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.080
 about 25 years ago, and he described an experiment

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.120
 he had done in graduate school

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.320
 that exactly answered my question.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.600
 It explained what they call the lactate paradox

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.320
 of high altitude, where you can work full speed

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.280
 at high altitude without producing lactic acid

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.720
 the way you would at low altitude.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.160
 And he did it in the lab, basically,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.000
 showing that cells don't fully depolarize

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.460
 even when they're stimulated and working

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.120
 if they have a good supply of carbon dioxide.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.400
 So in the lab, he showed the CO2

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.220
 was preventing full depolarization,

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.480
 and that's why you see it at high altitude.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.920
 You don't depolarize enough to shift from oxidation

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.720
 to lactic acid production.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.920
 - I think somewhere you said that frequently depolarized

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.920
 cells can lead to this pathology of being killed

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.080
 in the process or the excitotoxicity and cancer, basically.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.200
 - Yeah, the cell depends on, at first,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.800
 using its internal glycogen to get the sugar

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.000
 it needs to produce carbon dioxide.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.040
 And if that's depleted, then it starts using

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.200
 any amino acids or fatty acids to oxidize,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.160
 and they produce less carbon dioxide

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.480
 and will turn on the wasteful process

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.480
 of producing lactic acid, and that starts a vicious circle.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.280
 - The fats producing less carbon dioxide

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.120
 is one of the aspects of that, the pyruvate decarboxylation,

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.960
 'cause that produces some CO2,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.440
 and something about oxygen economy or something?

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.340
 - Yeah, the carbohydrates carry their own oxygen.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.680
 Each carbon already has part of the carbon dioxide,

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.120
 where with fat, you have to start with molecular oxygen.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.820
 There's no oxygen built into the fat molecule.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.820
 You use the oxygen to produce the carbon dioxide

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.400
 for each atom of carbon in the fat,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.040
 where with carbohydrate, you use only half

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.080
 of the oxygen molecule, because there's already

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.960
 one oxygen atom attached to the carbon.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.540
 - It's funny, there was a large ketogenic diet person

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.280
 on a very popular podcast, and I think the interviewer

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.440
 was like, "What else are you researching right now?"

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.440
 And it was something about carbon dioxide.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.120
 And so it was just funny to see his whole lifestyle,

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.960
 ketogenic diets was like the antithesis

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.320
 of his newfound interest in carbon dioxide.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.160
 - Oh, yeah.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.480
 - I wanted to ask you a little bit about magnesium.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.600
 I found a little snippet.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.040
 Do you remember Andrew Kim, very smart gentleman

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.920
 that basically left the internet?

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.880
 So Andrew had written, "Magnesium or potassium

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.880
 is needed to form the phosphorylated ATPase

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.760
 that then, upon exposure to calcium or sodium,

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.480
 transfers a phosphate group to ADP, generating ATP."

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.080
 So in short, magnesium helps to retain and generate ATP.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.360
 And then you had called magnesium

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.160
 the basic protective calcium blocker.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.480
 - Yeah.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.200
 - Was he right in what he said?

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.040
 Do you agree with that?

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.860
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.700
 - Okay.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.600
 (laughs)

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.240
 The reason why I mentioned magnesium is a lot of times

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.400
 you talk about something like calcium,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.260
 and then there's an immediate need to interject

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.480
 with how much more important magnesium is than calcium.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.760
 - Yeah, and at the same time you're making ATP,

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.160
 you're subtracting some phosphate, inorganic phosphate,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.720
 from in that environment to get rid of

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.360
 its excitatory effect.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.240
 - The breakdown of ATP can increase

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.360
 the intracellular phosphate, but is the same thing occurring

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.420
 when a person is just eating way more phosphate

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.000
 than sodium and magnesium and calcium?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.060
 - Similar, it tends to push it in.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.040
 And fructose has the property of lowering

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.800
 intracellular phosphate.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.380
 And the phosphatases are very cell protective in general.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.760
 Getting the proteins unphosphorylated

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.900
 puts them into the resting state.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.840
 When you stick a phosphate onto a protein covalently,

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.160
 it tends to change its whole behavior.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.440
 The whole cell goes into the excited state.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.760
 But even before it gets there, gets attached enzymically,

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.880
 it's pulling the water system away from the resting state.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.640
 So my interpretation of muscle contraction

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.000
 or nerve excitation isn't that there is some little motor

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.120
 that runs on the so-called high energy bond.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.940
 The way they usually picture it is that the energy

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.800
 from the so-called high energy bond

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.760
 goes into some kind of a motor.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.920
 And that's what is happening rather than the parts

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.420
 that are left behind.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.920
 But one of my good professors, Sidney Bernhardt,

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.320
 I mentioned that in 1959 I saw that he had shown

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.820
 that there is no high energy bond in ATP.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.500
 And I said, "Why does everyone talk

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.000
 "about the high energy bond?"

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.120
 A famous guy from England had just been

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.280
 at the university that week.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.900
 And he never said very much, but he said,

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.320
 "Not everyone does."

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:18.320
 - Well, Gilbert says it in his 2001 book.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.840
 He says, "Scow presented his sodium pump hypothesis.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.960
 "Podolsky and Morales demonstrated

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.100
 "that the high energy phosphate bond concept

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.680
 "was in serious trouble."

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.680
 - Yeah, it was in '59 it was killed by Sidney Bernhardt.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.360
 - But I mean, it's still common talk today, correct?

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.840
 - Yeah, yeah, horrifyingly.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.120
 It makes you miss the whole thing that's happening,

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.300
 which is that you don't want that free phosphate

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.680
 messing up your water system.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.000
 - Sorry if I missed it.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.320
 It's interfering with the ordering of the water,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.680
 the differentiation between what you called the wild

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.700
 or the bulk water and the orderly oriented water.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.200
 But what is it doing to specifically de-energize the cell?

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.820
 You said it was excitotoxic.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.980
 Is that increasing some messenger or something

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.600
 to de-energize the mitochondria?

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.680
 - No messenger, just the whole system changes

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.920
 the way it's lined up.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.560
 Like if you have a bunch of soldiers lined up in rows

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.160
 and then you say, "Given order,"

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.840
 and suddenly the whole thing melts

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.440
 and there's no longer any rows,

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.000
 that's sort of a whole phase transition is what's happening.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.640
 And that's the problem with the receptor idea

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.760
 that everything to some extent is a receptor.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.840
 When you have a thousand different things

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.120
 getting ordered differently when it's in one state

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.760
 than in the other, the order that has been kept

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.120
 in the proper positions melts as a whole process,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.520
 not as a series of isolated processes.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.520
 - Okay, so it sounds like I'm thinking about

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.260
 phosphate a little too simply.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:02.420
 - Yeah, like melting water or anything or freezing it.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:07.000
 You can cool water well below zero degree Celsius

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.980
 and still have liquid water.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.520
 But given the right trigger, suddenly all of the molecules

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.960
 can cooperate in such a way that they freeze up.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.920
 - So you could call phosphate like a depolarizer,

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.040
 basically, in excess?

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:22.880
 - Yeah.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.080
 - And then that would lead to the cell

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.840
 just having to make the choice of dying or being killed.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.400
 - Yeah, if it can't find its internal resources

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.200
 of ideally the glycogen and oxygen,

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.240
 if something cuts off its oxygen and glucose supply,

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.760
 then it starts eating itself

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.800
 and it's in danger of disintegrating.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.720
 And it can do that in more or less organized ways.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.720
 If it's taken by surprise, it can dump its innards out

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.920
 in very distressing ways.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.120
 But if it is gradual enough that it is deprived of energy,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.160
 then it can get itself organized

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.320
 so that it makes its internal materials available

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.960
 to other parts of the organism.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.400
 So when you're exercising one set of muscles,

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.800
 if you go about it gradually, you can build those up

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.480
 and not subtract too much from the others

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.620
 because you're feeding what they need.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.480
 But if you are very intense in your exercise,

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.760
 if it's stressful, then the cortisol gets the material

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.100
 by shutting off the oxygen sugar use in idle cells,

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.720
 causing them to slowly release their material

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.920
 that can be used by the active cells to build them up.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.840
 So stress hormones partly are there

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.120
 to prevent toxic death of cells,

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.720
 make it an orderly disintegration

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.160
 that can help the other parts of the organism.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.560
 - What you just said reminded me of a Selye quote

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.280
 where he was saying that everything

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.000
 is being affected equally,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.840
 but there is like a weakest link somewhere in there

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.440
 that can lead to some specific pathology.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.240
 Do you think that's the right idea?

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.480
 - Yeah, it's the working system.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.240
 It's an adaptive process that feeds support

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.760
 into the system that's working and functioning.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.080
 The idea of the functional system,

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.840
 it includes the way your brain is working too.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.640
 Habits are sort of a functional system.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.880
 You integrate your thoughts and your digestive processes

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.760
 and your muscle activities around a way of living,

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.600
 and that supports that pattern.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.320
 So you tend to get in a rut

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.880
 if you don't have things to interrupt

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.800
 and give you a more general way of functioning.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.960
 - The brain is what is it born into the culture

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.760
 and then the culture lives in the nervous system.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.360
 And then Maslow said something like

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.720
 the culture should be like an adaptive tool.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.160
 And so that being essential in a person's reactivity

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.760
 to certain stresses.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.560
 - Yeah, the social system should be intelligent basically,

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.880
 and then it wouldn't degrade the participants in it.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.600
 But when the social system is designed unintelligently,

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.680
 it's participating in the degrading process.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.680
 (laughing)

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.520
 Maslow said it a lot more elegantly.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.480
 (laughing)

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.560
 - Well, I always like reading your stuff

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.160
 and I'll see something from Maslow

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.640
 or I'll see something from Rogers,

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.800
 and it will make me understand your work

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.360
 a little bit better.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.760
 - I had been reading "Freud and the Freudians"

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.880
 for six months when I found Maslow's book.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.000
 It was a tremendous experience just the way he spoke.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.880
 - Was he thought of as like crackpot at the time?

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.480
 'Cause I haven't found anything

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.560
 that I haven't liked about him so far.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.920
 - Yeah, he was a great irritant to the Freudians

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.240
 who were still there and the new behaviorists

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.440
 were coming on and they didn't think

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.960
 he was at all scientific.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.360
 - Do you feel similarly about Rogers?

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.400
 I know you had a criticism about him.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.920
 - Yeah, his approach was great for the union breakers.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.560
 They immediately saw that and one of his collaborators

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.520
 on the book, "The Sciences of Man," I think it was called,

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.280
 his co-author said that his approach

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.800
 was good for the tobacco industry.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.920
 So was Selye, Selye was a cigarette promoter,

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.440
 but Rogers, his first book, "Client-Centered Therapy,"

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.880
 the back part of it gives the philosophical basis.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.760
 It's a very good description of phenomenology.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.920
 It's philosophically very good,

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.160
 but it can be made bad use of by bad people.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.160
 - So if I understand what you're saying,

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.880
 the bad part about it, not wanting to--

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.120
 - Not wanting to attack and criticize.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.980
 - Okay, and is that a bad part of "Client-Centered Therapy"

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.400
 because, I mean, he wasn't interjecting.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.240
 - Yeah, Maslow would just butt in and say,

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.840
 (laughing)

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.280
 you're feeling messed up because you're dealing

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.640
 with a horrible situation and just get out of that situation.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.680
 - To play devil's advocate, somebody might be like,

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.120
 well, that's an authoritarian way of approaching things.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.240
 - But a direct way of being anti-authoritarian

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.800
 can look authoritarian, but it isn't.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.160
 And actually, the super anti-authoritarian Rogers followers

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.160
 end up leaving the authoritarians in place.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.380
 - Well, that's kind of funny.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.480
 I swear I'm not obsessed with libertarianism,

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.500
 but it seems like they say, we're not authoritarian,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.200
 so we're gonna get rid of the government

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.080
 and then break up into these small groups.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.240
 - Yeah, that's the Koch brothers and their ilk.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.400
 They pose as anti-authoritarians, libertarians,

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.240
 because they want to have absolute power.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.800
 They really would like to own the government,

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.240
 but if people still insist on voting and things,

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.160
 then they want to break up the government entirely

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.440
 and then have their own governing system.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.440
 - And they want all types of different "freedom,"

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.120
 except they don't want economic freedom.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.880
 - Yeah, they want the army

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.920
 and their way of controlling the money system.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.040
 - There was a website called,

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.280
 I think it was the Naked Capitalism,

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.280
 and they had a series of articles

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.200
 called "Journey into a Libertarian Future."

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.760
 And the series was satirical,

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.820
 but they were using real quotes from a person,

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.320
 I think the name was Hans Hermann Hoppe.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.760
 And it was enlightening,

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.180
 not only because a lot of the libertarians I'm aware of

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.680
 seem to be genetic determinists,

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.080
 but the author was also,

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.360
 he seemed to have a misanthropic contempt for humanity

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.480
 and using phrases, I think, like a natural authority

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.760
 and favoring the elite.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.520
 So it was just a pretty eye-opening of something

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.960
 that I used to consider to be very anti-authoritarian.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.120
 - Have you read any of Murray Bookchin's books or articles?

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.000
 - No, no.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.320
 - He was a good libertarian compared to the Koch type.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.800
 - You had mentioned Joe Rahman, antiwar.com,

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.960
 Joe Romano, maybe?

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.200
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.040
 Those are pretty good libertarians.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.520
 They don't want to kill everyone.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.080
 (laughing)

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.200
 They consider themselves the archaic conservatives.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.240
 I forget the term,

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.240
 but they're the old-fashioned conservatives

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.900
 who actually believe in freedom

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.840
 rather than freedom to control everyone else.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.840
 - Something else libertarians often talk about

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.440
 is the non-aggression principle.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.900
 That might sound good just at face value,

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.340
 but based on Han Selye's or your work of stress,

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.900
 the non-aggression principle really doesn't make any sense

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.620
 when you stress a person to fight for their survival.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:37.300
 And if you have to provide for yourself or your family

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.300
 or you or your family are gonna die,

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.980
 who cares about the non-aggression principle?

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.180
 - Yeah, there's the reality problem.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.020
 - Okay, do you want to switch gears a little bit

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.180
 and talk about parathyroid hormone and serotonin

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.620
 because you're the only person I know of

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.020
 that makes the connection between the two.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.300
 And so what's happening exactly?

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.340
 I know the low thyroid or hyperventilation

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.180
 or too much estrogen and low thyroid

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.660
 and an excess of estrogen

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.700
 tend to promote the loss of carbon dioxide

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.940
 and hyperventilation.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:10.100
 And that's causing the platelets are carrying the serotonin

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.160
 that's primarily produced in the intestine

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.060
 and the platelets are becoming leaky

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.620
 and the serotonin is leaking out

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.380
 and that's activating the parathyroid glands.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:21.940
 - Yeah, the place that that should be normal

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.500
 is in lactation.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.860
 The serotonin turns on prolactin

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.540
 and the prolactin is parallel to the parathyroid hormone.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.740
 Both of those break down the bone

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.460
 to provide extra calcium for lactation.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.180
 So the serotonin works systematically

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.940
 in a logical way to make milk.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:44.940
 But when hypothyroidism is the reason for excess serotonin,

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.460
 hypothyroidism in itself,

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.420
 because you're not producing very much carbon dioxide

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.620
 by not using oxygen much,

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.620
 any little exertion tends to use up your energy

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.340
 and you have to then resort to glycolysis

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:06.340
 and produce the lactic acid and inflammatory state.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.700
 And hypothyroid people run at a higher level

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.700
 of histamine, serotonin, and usually adrenaline too.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:18.700
 Everything is using the emergency system unnecessarily.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.660
 Just a background state of a very hypothyroid person

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.540
 is hyperventilating in the sense of running around

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.860
 with those processes turned on.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.340
 So when they go to a higher altitude

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.820
 and get even less oxygen and breathe faster,

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.340
 their hyperventilation becomes visible.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.820
 But anyone, if they're driven to breathe faster

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.740
 than they should, if they use up their carbon dioxide,

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.940
 anything that makes you, like an inflammation

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.460
 that produces lactic acid and serotonin

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.020
 will turn on hyperventilation

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.220
 and stop the adequate production of carbon dioxide.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.660
 And that sets in motion the things

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.660
 like causing the platelets to release more serotonin

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.460
 and the serotonin activating the prolactin

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.180
 and parathyroid hormone.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.860
 It causes chronic breakdown of your bones.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.900
 - And something you had said

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.980
 that I thought was super fascinating,

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:15.900
 you said that you ideally, like in a Vernadskyian ideal state

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.500
 where the organism was realized

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.220
 in like a really good environment,

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.220
 you would barely need your hormones.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.660
 And I was thinking about parathyroid hormone,

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.220
 I was thinking about it too simplistically

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.100
 of just being suppressed by calcium, potassium,

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.220
 magnesium, or sodium.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.620
 But like you just said, the primary thing

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.460
 holding it down is carbon dioxide.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.540
 And so if the atmosphere just spontaneously increased

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.940
 in carbon dioxide, you would need less of your hormones

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.500
 because they're having this adaptive function.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.580
 - Yeah, and an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.300
 is gonna produce lots of sugary fruit

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.620
 and make the diet easier to keep the carbohydrate up

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.380
 as well as the atmosphere

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.900
 keeping you from wasting your glucose.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.420
 - Is there much information on the Carboniferous period?

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.620
 That's when the Earth had

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.180
 an extremely high concentration of carbon dioxide?

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.900
 - Yeah, there are lots of coal deposits

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.580
 that show what was going on there.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.620
 - Wasn't there like a rapid evolutionary escalation?

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.580
 - Yeah, just a burst of innovation biologically.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.100
 - Is that on a cycle?

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.180
 Could something like that be estimated to occur

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.740
 in the future sometime or?

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:23.180
 - There are people working on the idea of cycles

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.180
 of the Earth more or less coordinated

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.940
 with cycles of the sun.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.460
 There are different opinions about whether you can have

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.260
 an approximate idea of when that's going to happen.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.420
 But the smaller cycles, the ice ages,

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.580
 are somewhat easier to see meaningful cycles in.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.780
 In 1940, the consensus was that a new ice age

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.060
 was approaching.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.940
 The temperatures had been warming

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.820
 in the first part of the century,

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.100
 but it looked like they were now regressing.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.900
 And that opinion stuck around from 1940

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.220
 when I was in high school.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.300
 It was in the magazines and such.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:03.140
 And as recently as 1974, '75, "Time" magazine

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.420
 and "New York Times."

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.980
 And then in 1979, another article in "New York Times."

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.380
 They were talking about an oncoming ice age again

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.380
 from 1940 to 1979.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.500
 But then a three-mile island scared people

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.020
 about nuclear power.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.220
 And that scare scared the Pentagon

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.020
 that they would lose their nuclear fuel for making bombs.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.420
 And almost immediately, they came out with a theory

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:34.020
 that carbon dioxide was going to create a too hot planet.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.940
 No more talk about the ice age

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.900
 that had been discussed for 35 years.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.420
 - I've actually, I've heard that before.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.140
 And somebody was detailing the transition between,

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.460
 he called them the oiligarchs

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.420
 or the Rockefeller Standard Oil,

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.740
 have transitioned into the green movement.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.700
 And those are all the same people saying,

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.140
 don't have children and humans are cancer on this planet.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.060
 And also saying things like the carbon dioxide is bad.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.740
 But they were detailing the transition

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.140
 from being scared of global cooling

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.980
 to this new fear of global warming.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.060
 - Yeah, people are a cancer

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.460
 because now we have automation and don't need workers.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.220
 Where the Rockefeller Foundation,

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.500
 starting in the early 1900s,

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.980
 was pioneering disease prevention

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.020
 because they needed healthy workers.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.980
 And now that there's automation,

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.860
 it would be very economical to get rid

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.420
 of about four or five billion workers.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.820
 - Upon watching that documentary,

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.980
 they were talking about standard oil producing mustard gas

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.380
 and then mustard gas being resynthesized into chemotherapy.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:35.780
 - Oh yeah, basically.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:39.100
 One of my favorite examples of research financing

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.300
 was Elwood Jensen,

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.620
 was a government financed chemical warfare person

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.540
 working on things better than cyanide for killing people.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.900
 And the government transitioned him

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.580
 right into working on estrogen.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.940
 And around that time,

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:02.380
 estrogen became a big government as well as industry topic

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.060
 with cancer institutes taking up the study of estrogen.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:10.340
 And Elwood Jensen invented the estrogen receptor.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.700
 The government gave him

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.700
 the only radioactively labeled estrogen

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.780
 to do his research with.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.580
 And using that, he said that there is no metabolism

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.620
 of estrogen by the uterus.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.580
 So all you people studying enzymology

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.580
 to explain how estrogen works, you're wrong.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.900
 It's just hitting the receptor, no metabolism.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:38.900
 It turns on the genes and the genes turn on femaleness.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.820
 And then 15 or 20 years later,

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:45.220
 other people had access to the various isotopes

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.580
 that they could show.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:50.220
 Yes, the uterus does metabolize estrogen,

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.260
 but meanwhile, everyone had adopted the idea

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.540
 of a receptor turning on genes.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.260
 - Do you think Elwood Jensen's research

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.780
 was being guided by the hands of these eugenics fanatics?

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.580
 - Yeah, I think the chemical warfare

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:07.580
 and estrogen Pentagon people are all clearly doing that.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.980
 As a side light, they are seeing that inducing cancer

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:16.500
 almost instantly can be a useful tool for the military.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.340
 - Well, I might as well mention it

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.180
 'cause I've talked about it,

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.140
 but it's James Corvette's "How Big Oil Conquered the World"

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.860
 and then "Why Big Oil Conquered the World."

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.380
 And he just very precisely documents

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:32.380
 how obsessed the elite people were with eugenics

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.460
 and how that was, and you've talked about it extensively,

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:40.220
 and it just seems very deep rooted of the class system

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:43.980
 of we're useless eaters and things like of that nature.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.380
 - Yeah, the whole genetics movement itself,

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.140
 genetics, not eugenics, grew out of that motivation.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:55.780
 The original famous geneticists were also eugenicists,

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.260
 and the Journal of Eugenics,

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.860
 after Hitler became a target of scorn,

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:05.820
 the eugenics journal changed its name to Human Genetics.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.460
 And just after I got my PhD,

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.620
 I wrote an article in the graduate student newspaper

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.820
 and mentioned that fact that the eugenics people

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:17.620
 were still around, still teaching genetics,

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.540
 but that they were embarrassed

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.460
 and mentioned the Journal of Eugenics in the library.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.820
 That week, all of the old volumes disappeared.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.620
 (laughing)

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.540
 - And not to go too off track,

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.460
 but wasn't Hitler was funded

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.700
 by one of the Dulles brothers or not just-

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.980
 - No, no, they were his employees,

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.740
 but on Standard Oil and several of the big banks,

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.620
 the Bush family and some of the big Democrat,

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:48.260
 I guess they were at times in the State Department,

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.980
 but in the banks primarily,

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.340
 they were financing the fascists

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.780
 right into and through the war.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.860
 And as the war was declared,

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.300
 Roosevelt's government declared that,

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.740
 I think it was Alan Dulles was officially declared

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.180
 a German enemy agent temporarily,

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.940
 but then very shortly after that,

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.460
 he was put into the secret service or the OSS,

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.260
 I think it was called, and then the CIA,

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.540
 and his brother put into the State Department.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:18.460
 And if you look at the whole 10 or 15 years history

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.700
 of how those corporate powers were treating Roosevelt,

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:26.380
 in 1933, they had organized a coup

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.060
 and they recruited a Marine Corps General,

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.020
 Smedley Butler, to lead the army into Washington

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.300
 to put him out of office.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:40.300
 And he gathered information as they were communicating

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.980
 between the corporations

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.460
 through intermediaries with Butler.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:47.420
 And he took the information to Congress and said,

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.380
 "Look, these big corporations are planning a coup."

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.340
 Congress investigated and confirmed what he said,

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.220
 but then did nothing.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.100
 After 12 more years,

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.460
 they were influential in putting Truman in

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.060
 as vice president in place of Henry Wallace,

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.900
 because Wallace had gone on record

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:10.900
 as favoring a continuation of Roosevelt's anti-war policies.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.540
 Alan Dulles was, meanwhile,

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.700
 in charge of European negotiations.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:23.140
 He, just a week or two before Roosevelt's death,

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:27.300
 Alan Dulles was secretly and against instructions

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.860
 agreed upon by Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.540
 Alan Dulles was making deals with the Nazis

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.580
 to have the Nazis not fight the Americans

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.540
 and to go fight the Russians.

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.540
 Truman heard about it and said,

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.460
 "That information must be false

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.060
 "because no one would do that."

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.500
 Stalin heard about it first,

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.420
 and that was how Roosevelt heard about it,

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.420
 but Stalin just has no judgment

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.060
 to think that could happen.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.780
 And then, within a few days,

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.580
 Roosevelt conveniently died

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:00.020
 before he had to accuse Dulles of the treason

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.540
 he was involved in.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.180
 Alan Dulles then made deals

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.380
 with the German intelligence apparatus

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.660
 and unified the US intelligence system

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.340
 with the Nazi system,

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:14.540
 and that's what has set the course of history.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.180
 - I guess there was a story about Alan Dulles's son,

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.620
 who, I guess, was having some psychotic problem

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.460
 or alleged psychotic problem,

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.420
 and he would say things like, "My dad is a Nazi spy,"

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.500
 and the author of wherever I had read this said,

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.780
 but he never said that again

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.580
 after they gave him his anti-psychotic medication.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.540
 (both laughing)

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.740
 - Probably hurt so much.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:40.100
 - But the person, I think Tarpley said this,

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.460
 that possibly had poisoned Roosevelt

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:43.940
 was the painter woman.

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.380
 Do you have any perspective on that?

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.940
 - Oh, yeah, there was talk about the inhalant

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.620
 that he used while he was being painted,

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.580
 just putting a little too much benzadrine

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.340
 or something in the inhalant.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.700
 He sniffed it, held his head,

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.780
 and had an excruciating pain in his head

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.900
 after sniffing his inhalant,

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.060
 and then that inhalant disappeared.

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.540
 - I had never heard that connection

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.020
 between Dulles and Roosevelt,

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.420
 and so he's very implicated

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:15.940
 in two high-profile presidential assassinations.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.460
 - Oh, yeah, and have you heard any of the connections

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.740
 of Lee Harvey Oswald's landlady and DeMoran Schilt?

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:24.420
 Lee Harvey Oswald's landlady

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.180
 who was working with DeMoran Schilt,

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:30.860
 who was a 35-year associate of Dulles,

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.260
 they were both helping Lee Harvey Oswald get jobs

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.780
 like in the convenient book building in Dallas,

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:43.100
 and his landlady was a very close family friend

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.340
 of the Dulles'.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.900
 Both of the people managing his movements

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.740
 for the last few months of his life

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:52.340
 were close longtime associates of Alan Dulles'.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.140
 - When you're going through life

00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:55.820
 and you're hearing these certain things,

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.620
 are you just wondering what's really going on?

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.020
 When you're hearing that Kennedy was assassinated

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.020
 and things like that?

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.020
 - No, my first thought was that Kennedy was such a bad man.

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:06.860
 No wonder.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.620
 (laughing)

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:12.180
 But then, immediately within a week or so,

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.540
 I realized it was a coup

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:17.380
 for putting an even worse man in office.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.820
 - And something, I think Douglas, no, no,

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.420
 maybe Tarbly said, but we don't know

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.660
 who the new Alan Dulles is right now,

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.980
 but he's certainly, I mean, maybe you do,

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:33.620
 but he certainly set a precedent of things to come

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.820
 which are still, I guess, unraveling right now.

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.620
 - Yeah, Alan Dulles started associating

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.900
 with that banker by politician crowd

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.980
 when he was about 10 years old.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.220
 So he had real skill and background

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:52.700
 in how to maneuver through the political criminal world.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.740
 And I don't think there's anyone

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.500
 with such a extreme international

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.460
 social background operating.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.500
 So I think there are basically a lot of klutzes.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.420
 - I only have a single other question to ask you.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.380
 I get the feeling, and I could be wrong,

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:12.540
 from reading, occasionally being privy to various responses,

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.820
 like the best page, I feel like, on the Ray Peate Forum

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.020
 is the link to your email wiki,

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.020
 which people compile your responses,

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.180
 which I think can be very valuable.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.140
 And it seems like occasionally you've mentioned

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.820
 that pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA,

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.580
 and/or thyroid aren't as effective

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.860
 if the vitamin D and/or calcium are low.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.660
 And my question was, I know that PTH

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.940
 can inhibit mitochondrial respiration,

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:41.940
 but is it such a powerful break on the metabolism

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.500
 that getting the vitamin D and the calcium

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.980
 or carbon dioxide in order would just be important

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.060
 for having these other things work effectively?

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.060
 - You have to include sodium

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.660
 and a lot of other things in there,

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.740
 but yeah, it's one of the adequate breaks on the system.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.060
 - Is that because of the specific actions

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.060
 of parathyroid hormone, or is it because it causes

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:07.500
 mast cells to release serotonin and other things like that?

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.020
 - Yeah, it's part of a system,

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.100
 so in itself is very powerful.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.100
 The vitamin D and calcium are working on other things too,

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.740
 and so you can't say that they're only working

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.500
 on the parathyroid hormone.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.260
 They work on the serotonin and proactin and growth hormone,

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.860
 essentially everything in themselves to different degrees.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.900
 - When I think about like introing somebody

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.260
 into like a lot of this information,

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.020
 it seems relatively easy to go get your vitamin D measured

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:34.900
 and then to use it.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.020
 I guess, is that something you feel comfortable

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:40.060
 like consulting to large amounts of random people?

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.940
 It seems like something fairly safe to talk about.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:43.780
 - Yeah.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.380
 - Okay, Ray, that's all I had for you.

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.220
 Hey, you know what?

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.060
 Do you want to touch on progesterone real quick?

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:53.340
 I know that just online there was a general confusion

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.060
 where people were misconstruing things about progesterone

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.260
 that you might wanna clear up.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.180
 - Oh, yeah.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:02.780
 People have been saying completely imaginary things.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:06.820
 I imagine someone wanting to sell a product

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:10.540
 other than Progest-E complex must have made them up

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:14.260
 because they have no connection to reality.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:18.100
 That I had nothing to do with the Progest-E formula.

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:23.060
 It's exactly the formula that I developed in 1976

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.420
 and has been exactly the same thing all these years.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.420
 But people have been saying

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:32.380
 that they added estrogenic substances to it.

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:35.500
 A lot of people saying that they get estrogen symptoms.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.300
 It is the usual internet placebo,

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.780
 negative placebo suggestibility.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.860
 But the story that formula has changed,

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.260
 it seems to have been repeatedly promoted

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.700
 on some of the internet discussion places.

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.900
 - Lastly, can we just touch on a tiny bit

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.980
 on why somebody might have a strange reaction to progesterone?

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.780
 Like you mentioned that when estrogen is being eliminated,

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.660
 it can pass through an inflamed tissue

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.820
 and then the tissue can contain a large amounts

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.620
 of beta-glucuronidase

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.380
 and that will remove the glucuronic acid

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:09.020
 leaving pure estrogen to accumulate in the tissues.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:12.260
 It's not unheard of that somebody similar to thyroid

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.020
 or anything that's safe,

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.220
 it depends on the system it's going into.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.460
 And if the person is extremely estrogenic.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.020
 - Except that when you're talking about a whole system,

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.300
 the progesterone is also protecting

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:27.420
 against the inflamed system with its beta-glucuronidase.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:30.380
 And so it's tending to stop that process too.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.580
 So the more you take,

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:34.380
 basically the more stable everything is.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:38.900
 It inhibits the glucuronidase and the sulfatase

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.860
 which reactivate estrogen

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.700
 and it activates the transferases of sulfate

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.900
 and glucuronide to inactivate estrogen.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.380
 And it has a similarly organized effect

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.900
 on the various dehydrogenases

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.820
 that reduce the activity of estradiol

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.300
 and the opposing systems.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.580
 It has the same protective effect

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:06.540
 on preventing the activation of estrone back to estradiol.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.780
 So everything progesterone does in reference to estrogen,

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.380
 there are at least 11 things that I've counted

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.180
 that it consistently, everywhere you look,

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.820
 is anti-estrogenic.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:21.220
 So I think it's all a suggestibility.

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:24.620
 One of the first times I experienced that

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.780
 was a pregnant woman said progesterone

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.380
 was having some strange effect

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.820
 and I asked her how much she had taken.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.740
 And she said she put it on her wrist,

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.940
 a dime-sized area on her wrist.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.180
 And she had heard about transdermal use

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:44.060
 of scopolamine or such thing for travel sickness.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.140
 And she was putting one drop in one spot

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.900
 and thinking it should have an effect.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.540
 If you take a minuscule amount

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.540
 and then look at your symptoms,

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.660
 you're bound to notice some symptom

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.900
 that has nothing to do with the microscopic amount

00:40:58.900 --> 00:40:59.900
 you've absorbed.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.460
 - So besides not taking enough,

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.100
 which you've detailed in your progesterone summaries article,

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.780
 I think you've also mentioned things like

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.940
 thyroid function being too low

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:13.300
 and/or vitamin D deficiency could cause those symptoms,

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.500
 not necessarily because of the progesterone,

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.620
 but because of these other inflammatory aspects

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.780
 that the person is already dealing with.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:24.260
 - Yeah, one person said she had no effect

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.060
 from taking 100 milligrams,

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:29.180
 a fourth of a teaspoon of the progeste

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.860
 and asked her to repeat the dose.

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:35.540
 If she took as much as 400 milligrams a teaspoon

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.380
 and still didn't feel anything.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.260
 And when she had her blood tested,

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:43.620
 her estrogen was the highest I've ever seen.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:47.300
 It was 100 times higher than the estrogen should have been.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.060
 And when your estrogen reaches a certain point,

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.940
 there's no absorptive capacity,

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.580
 no carrying capacity into the blood

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.900
 that can carry enough progesterone to have an effect.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.140
 And for those people,

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.180
 it's necessary to work on the liver,

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.580
 feeding the liver protein or B vitamins,

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.900
 whatever it needs to start detoxifying the estrogen

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.820
 and increase the thyroid if necessary

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.420
 to make the liver metabolize the estrogen.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.780
 - Well, similarly, I remember you saying

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.020
 that if you were drinking milk or orange juice,

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.740
 presuming that the orange juice was sweet

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.580
 and not tart or sour, that it could cause,

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.460
 or some people will say like, oh, it really bloats me.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.340
 And in my experience,

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.740
 and my experience was made more clear by you saying

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.940
 that, oh, sometimes when you drink liquids,

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:36.500
 it makes inflammation in the intestine more noticeable.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.180
 I thought that was really profound

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.540
 because not only did I feel like

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:41.340
 I really had experienced it,

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.420
 but many people will say similar things.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.380
 And I think it's maybe just speaking

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.820
 to the prevalency of intestinal inflammation.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.260
 - Yeah, and the word bloat has various meanings.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:56.100
 Some people who have one or two ounces of liquid

00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:00.580
 around their intestines verified by ultrasound or such,

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:04.940
 just a small amount of fluid in the abdominal cavity

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.300
 can create a sensation of fullness.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.620
 And some people refer to that as bloat

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.500
 or an enlarged uterus.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.740
 Some people feel bloated.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:16.380
 But when it's digestive,

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:19.420
 if you aren't digesting your carbohydrate,

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.540
 the bacteria can produce a large amount of gas.

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.540
 And the usual traditional meaning of bloat

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.620
 was accumulated gas.

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.620
 And the test for that is just to thump your belly

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.140
 with your fingers.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.060
 You can tap it in different places

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:37.100
 and find exactly where there's a gas deposit if there is.

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.780
 - I think that's all the questions I have for you.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.140
 What are you working on right now, Ray?

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:45.060
 - Cholesterol and then progesterone

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.740
 will be my next newsletters.

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:51.380
 Thinking about the evolutionary, in every sense,

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.700
 implications and meaning of cholesterol and progesterone.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.900
 - Awesome, you have been so generous with your time.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.260
 My sincere thanks.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.100
 Thank you so much, Ray.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.500
 It's always a pleasure and I'll talk to you soon.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.340
 - Okay, thanks.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.940
 (upbeat music)

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:16.180
 - That's gonna conclude this week's episode.

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.380
 I'd like to thank Ray again for talking with me today

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.260
 along with my patrons for their support of the show

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.100
 and all the content I produce.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.020
 If I didn't have patrons, I couldn't do any of this.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.860
 So I sincerely appreciate it.

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.500
 As always, if you enjoyed the show,

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.980
 please hit the like button on YouTube

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.100
 and leave a comment or a constructive criticism below.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.780
 I always say this, but I have an amazing listenership

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.900
 and I'm extremely fortunate for anybody

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.220
 to care about anything that I do.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.780
 This show was extremely fun for me

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.140
 and it just seemed like a nice free flowing conversation.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:49.060
 It's actually the second conversation that we had done.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.580
 I first got Ray on the phone and we talked about calcium.

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:55.300
 Then I had to fill in some gaps with that show

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:56.780
 and I got him on the phone again.

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:59.140
 And I liked the second conversation so much better

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.060
 that I decided to go with that one.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:04.260
 I will probably release snippets from the first show

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.300
 just to tie everything together.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.860
 But really thanks to Ray for getting on the phone with me

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:12.180
 twice and bearing with me through these questions.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.460
 So thank you so much, Ray.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:14.740
 And thanks again for listening.

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.140
 I'll talk to you guys soon.

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.720
 (upbeat music)

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.300
 (upbeat music)

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.480
 (upbeat music)

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.060
 (upbeat music)

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.640
 (upbeat music)
