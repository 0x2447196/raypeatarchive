00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720
 Well, welcome to the Get Fit with Jodell show.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.920
 I am, as usual, Jodell, and I am so excited to have Dr. Ray Peat with me today.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.800
 He's someone you're about to come to love, just as I do.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.280
 He graciously is sharing his time with me today over the phone.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.720
 You will be amazed at the knowledge that he is about to drop.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.520
 I'm sure the laundry list of credentials this man holds, as well as just his passion for

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.520
 helping people.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.640
 Well, let's just say it's more than you or I could ever dream of holding.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.400
 So Dr. Peat has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon, specializing in physiology.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.120
 He has taught at the University of Oregon Urbana College, Montana State University,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.840
 National College of Naturopathic Medicine, Universidad Veracruzana, and the Universidad

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.720
 Autonoma del Estado de Mexico, and Blake College as well.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.920
 Over the years, he has worked with many private clients with nutritional counseling.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.480
 He started his research in 1968, so long before any of us so-called nutrition nerds who make

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.760
 videos on YouTube, myself included, were even born, mainly regarding progesterone and the

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.320
 hormones closely related to it as protectors of the body's structure and energy against

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.320
 harmful effects of estrogen, radiation, stress, and lack of oxygen.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.840
 I'm not done yet.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.800
 He also is an editor and writer of his famous newsletter he puts out, as well as the author

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.000
 for some fantastic quick reads, "When You Have a Moment," one of which is my favorite

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.920
 Nutrition for Wisdom.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.200
 He's also an artist, and some of his artwork, as well as his amazing blog post, can be seen

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.680
 at rayPeate.com.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.000
 Dr. Peate, I'm so excited to speak with you today.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 How are you doing?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Very good.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Thank you.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Good.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.120
 Will you please tell my listeners briefly what got you into this passion you have for

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.800
 all things related to stress, hormones, thyroid, and really helping people feel more optimal?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:24.640
 In the 1950s and '60s, I was interested in psychology and language.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.120
 I started a school in Mexico, Blake College.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.840
 That was just a general liberal arts school for both United States students and local

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.840
 Mexican students.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.760
 In the process, I noticed that lots of the local people in Mexico were eating a very

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.760
 bad diet.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:03:01.000
 A couple of my friends had family members who were very sick.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.960
 Having read Adele Davis' books, I suggested some of her nutritional therapies.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.720
 For example, a friend's nephew had been in the hospital for two or three days with diarrhea

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.720
 that they couldn't control.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720
 The third day, I think, they said she wouldn't live the night.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:31.200
 At that point, my friend decided there was no harm in trying the vitamin B6 supplement

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:39.160
 that was one of Adele Davis' recommendations for diarrhea.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:48.160
 He gave the little kid this 10-milligram tablet of vitamin B6.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
 Within the hour, her diarrhea had stopped.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.960
 She was recovered in just a couple of days.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.960
 No more problems.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:10.280
 A single vitamin did what the whole hospital staff couldn't manage with intravenous treatments

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.280
 and so on.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:21.640
 I realized that a lot of information wasn't getting into the medical system.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:33.200
 I decided, after coming back to the U.S., to study biology instead of just the humanities,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.840
 language, psychology, and literature.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:50.280
 In graduate school, I ran into the same dogmatism and ignoring the really important practical

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.400
 information.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:00.920
 I had planned to study brain biology, but I saw that the professors were locked into

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.120
 a dogmatic view of how a nerve works.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:14.720
 Looking through the whole University of Oregon, I found that the reproductive physiology department

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:27.280
 was actually doing open research trying to discover what causes the infertility of aging

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.720
 and what the real factors in fertility and maintaining pregnancy are.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:43.720
 So I shifted from brain biology to reproductive physiology.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:52.240
 In examining what the factors are that make it possible for a fertilized ovum to develop

00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:03.440
 the whole organism and a nervous system, I found that the brain is governed and formed

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:14.640
 by the same factors that govern the question of fertility or infertility.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.280
 It's a very simple sort of a spectrum.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:25.600
 The same things that cause infertility cause bad development of the brain.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:36.000
 The brain is really the most sensitive part of the organism, and the same factors that

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.600
 make it healthy make it possible for the ovum to implant in the uterus.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:55.720
 So I concentrated on the factors that are regulated by those hormones of fertility.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:07.800
 I realized that the drug industry at that time, already for almost 30 years, had been

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:16.120
 propagandizing the public with the idea that estrogen is the female hormone.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:23.960
 In our lab, we saw that estrogen was the contraceptive hormone, not the hormone of fertility and

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.960
 pregnancy.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:36.400
 The pharmaceutical industry knew that estrogen made a good contraception pill.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.160
 It was actually causing abortions, but they didn't want to call it the abortion pill,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.960
 so they called it the anti-conception pill.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:56.800
 The real hormone of fertility and brain development turns out to be progesterone, which works

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:08.360
 by providing energy to the developing embryo in the form of oxygen and glucose, primarily,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:15.320
 making energy most efficiently by oxidizing glucose.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:21.760
 Estrogen is just one of the factors that interrupts that process.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:33.240
 Estrogen creates a local inflammation in the uterus, a kind of wound that will allow the

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:41.560
 ovum to be embedded in the tissue, but if the estrogen stays dominant, it kills the

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.560
 ovum.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:50.840
 So the function of progesterone is to knock the estrogen out of the tissue and shift that

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:59.680
 wound physiology, or local stress inflammatory physiology, into a supportive, oxidative,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.680
 sugar-rich environment.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.600
 Wow, that is not at all what we've been taught.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.040
 Even from a young age, I was always taught the importance of estrogen, but now we can

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.840
 clearly see, based on what you're saying, that it is like propaganda, what you mentioned.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:23.440
 So a lot of your work is done around these specific hormones like progesterone, but also

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.800
 the reason I really got interested in your work is because you talk so much about stress

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.080
 and how it affects our system.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.400
 Would you say that stress is really the driving factor behind most disease and that it contributes

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.400
 to the rise in estrogen?

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:49.400
 The way I define stress, I would say that it is the factor in all disease.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:56.160
 If you define it as a mismatch between organism and environment, then even the so-called genetic

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.160
 diseases are...

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:10.960
 For example, if you have sickle cell anemia in your genes, it happens that in Africa that's

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:23.560
 a defensive gene, and if the people are eating a certain type of diet that maintains an oxidative

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.600
 condition in the cells, there is no sickle cell disease.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.800
 It's simply a defensive mutation in that environment.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.800
 But when you don't have that environment, then it shows up as a disease that when you're

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:48.240
 under stress, the cells change shape and cause pain and sickness and possibly death.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:57.840
 So the genetic diseases turn out to be a disease of stress when the environment isn't properly

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840
 supportive.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:09.680
 So you can see even genetic and infectious diseases as a matter of stress.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:18.440
 If you have good nutrition, then the various bacteria in the environment won't cause dysentery,

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:25.920
 for example, because your immune system takes care of them and stops the whole inflammatory

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.920
 process.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:40.960
 And inflammation is the basic factor in why stress causes disease, and it's almost entirely

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.440
 overlooked as a factor in stress.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:57.280
 Now it's coming to be recognized as a matter of all kinds of disease, heart disease and

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.680
 obesity for example, are seen to originate with a stress physiology.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:12.240
 But what they're missing is that stress leads to inflammation and that leads to the various

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.240
 specific diseases.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:21.960
 And when you say stress, you're not really just talking about day-to-day living stress.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.960
 You're talking about environmental stressors like radiation, you're talking about pollutants,

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.280
 you're talking about the emotional stress, the mental stress and all of that environmental

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.280
 stress together, right?

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:56.120
 Yeah, it's when the environment is putting demands on you that you don't have the internal

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.120
 resources to meet smoothly.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:03.840
 So if you're dealing with weather and climate and physical demand, work, exertion and so

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:12.080
 on, without any stress at all, that same activity would kill someone who wasn't well nourished

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.400
 or maybe who was 80 or 90 years old.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:26.520
 So it's the matter of what kind of resources you have internally in proportion to the stress.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.240
 Can you help us understand these stressors of our modernized society, like I mentioned

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:37.400
 like radiation and even artificial light and things like that that can stress our system.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:44.120
 What are all of the things in our modernized society that have led to this stress as the

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.040
 main driving factor behind disease?

00:13:47.040 --> 00:14:02.720
 The drug industry, all kinds of technological industries have tried to cover up the fact

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:11.480
 that they are causing not only the disease of the people exposed to their products and

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:19.080
 byproducts, but even the offspring, descendants of those people that they're exposing.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:28.880
 So there's a big propaganda movement over the last hundred years to try to convince

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.760
 the public that pollution is not harmful.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:42.760
 Sixty years ago the government had a campaign to tell people that radiation was good for

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.760
 you.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.760
 You've probably heard that.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:50.760
 Hormesis is the idea of radiation hormesis or poison hormesis.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:57.880
 That a little poison is good for you.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:04.040
 That is a perversion of the idea of stress.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:13.720
 A teenager meeting a challenge, seeing for example a tennis game competition or swimming

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:22.280
 a certain distance and so on, meeting a challenge that is interesting actually builds your body

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:29.440
 and abilities of having a goal to build something.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.920
 You develop your skills in doing it so you're becoming more in meeting that challenge.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.080
 That is not a stress.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:44.680
 A stress is something that a demand that's put on you that you didn't ask for and that

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:51.160
 you don't have the ability to do easily and with pleasure.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:16:00.360
 So when pleasure isn't involved in the action it's probably going to be harmful to you in

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.360
 some way.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:11.280
 So just doing a boring and stupid job that many people spend their lives doing, that

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:20.080
 is poisoning your tissues constantly because you're not getting pleasure out of the activity.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.960
 I read that in Hans Selye's book Stress Without Distress.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.760
 That was one of the main sentences that I underlined when I was reading that book was

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.840
 how the stress that we're under has a lot to do with the fact that many people live

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:41.800
 these lives trying to appease their parents or this job that they think they should do

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.840
 but they really don't like.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.280
 At the end of their life they're left frustrated and more stressed than ever and they usually

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.960
 die of disease because of the chronic day in and day out life of something they didn't

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.640
 choose and they didn't want to live and it was miserable existence and they didn't serve

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.640
 a purpose.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.480
 So I don't think people think about how that is a stressor too, just doing a job that you

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.480
 don't love.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:14.480
 Did you ever hear about the rat studies in which they enriched their environment, gave

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:23.160
 them toys and things to play with and explore versus the rats that lived in ordinary little

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.520
 rat cages and what happened to their brains?

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:36.880
 In the early 1960s at the University of California, Marion Diamond and several other people found

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:47.040
 that the environment richness caused the brain to function better.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:54.800
 The rats that had a playpen rather than a little box to live in solved problems better

00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:00.800
 and they wondered why the brains were functioning better.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:10.200
 They found that their enzymes had changed very distinctly and when they let those animals

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:17.360
 reproduce their babies had bigger brains and were again more intelligent than the parents.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:28.080
 So it's an inheritable brain improvement that happens just by having an enjoyable daily

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:41.080
 routine or lack of routine, daily little novel experiences, entertaining things to discover.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:48.360
 The rats had playground equipment like swings and slides and balls and things.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:19:00.280
 More recently it has been found that the enriched environment rats not only had bigger more

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:09.440
 intelligent brains but their whole bodies were producing more progesterone and more

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:16.080
 recently still they were found to have lower levels of estrogen.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:24.600
 Back in the 70s Marion Diamond found that if you gave animals a supplement of progesterone

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:32.560
 their brains were bigger and when the mother was pregnant if you gave her estrogen their

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:39.760
 brains were shrunken because it stopped the growth by causing stress.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:46.200
 So what you're saying is this enjoyment is what I call vitamin P, pleasure, passion,

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.200
 purpose and I feel like there are a lot of people that are just doing a job and not living

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.440
 a passion or a purpose.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.760
 But that's one thing that drew me to you is you can tell that what you're doing is a passion

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.280
 and it certainly serves a purpose.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.800
 And I found you almost two years ago when I went through a really bad toxic mold exposure

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:10.800
 and my thyroid was hugely affected by that exposure so it was a huge stressor on my body

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:16.320
 even though I live a life that's pretty happy and I love my job and everything but my stress

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:21.240
 came from that environmental stress of like it completely tore apart my body, it completely

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.680
 broke down my thyroid just from that toxic mold exposure that took about a year and a

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.480
 half to bring my system back to full health from.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.440
 So how does the thyroid, I know you talk a lot about the thyroid and you're pretty passionate

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:40.360
 about it, how does the thyroid get affected by chronic stress or even acute stressors

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.360
 like a toxic mold?

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:51.960
 I was talking about the polarity and fertility and brain development of estrogen and progesterone.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:21:04.280
 In the background, the oxidative sugar metabolism that is controlled on the cell level by estrogen

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:12.800
 and progesterone, in the background it requires thyroid hormone to work.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:21.600
 You don't have any oxygen metabolism without thyroid so that's the without which not the

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.200
 progesterone operates.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:34.520
 And when someone cultured, took a slice of thyroid gland, put it in a culture dish and

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:46.160
 added hormones to it, they saw that if you added progesterone, the thyroid gland secreted

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:56.600
 the active thyroid hormone, it activated enzymes causing the thyroglobulin or colloids that

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:02.440
 stored in the cell caused it to break down into the active thyroid hormones.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:08.600
 And when they added estrogen to the culture dish, it blocked those enzymes and stopped

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:16.960
 the secretion but it allowed the cells to go on synthesizing the thyroglobulin without

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.840
 being able to produce the hormones.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:27.880
 So that single experiment explained why girls in their teens and women around menopause

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.600
 so often have a swollen thyroid gland.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:38.240
 Those are the times when estrogen has the risk of becoming dominant.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:45.360
 If you're under stress, you can't produce enough progesterone and in that condition,

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:53.240
 the thyroid gland keeps producing the colloid or globulin but it can't convert it into the

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:59.480
 active hormone and so your pituitary keeps driving the gland harder trying to make it

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:04.600
 produce hormone and all it does is make the gland swell up.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:13.640
 And so many women have had their thyroid gland destroyed either with surgery or radiation

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:21.120
 when all they needed was something to either lower the estrogen or give them a progesterone

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.120
 supplement.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:31.320
 Wow, I was just amazed at how my thyroid being damaged led to things like I had never had

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.840
 cellulite before and in three months time of an exposure to mold, the back of my legs

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.920
 went from completely smooth to completely cellulite ridden.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.280
 What was the mechanism behind that?

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:55.440
 Well, when your thyroid isn't adequate, regardless of how much estrogen is in your tissue, your

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.920
 cells act as if they are under the influence of estrogen.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:09.880
 Something I found in my research at the university was that estrogen's effects can't be distinguished

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:18.480
 biochemically, the metabolic effects can't be distinguished from the effects of radiation,

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:27.640
 x-rays or suffocation, the elimination of oxygen or poisoning with cyanide or other

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:32.320
 things that poison your oxidative system.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:40.680
 And interestingly at that time people had already identified polyunsaturated fatty acids

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:50.400
 as the source of age pigment and estrogen and radiation and oxygen deprivation all accelerate

00:24:50.400 --> 00:25:02.120
 the formation of age pigment causing the polyunsaturated fatty acids to spontaneously oxidize and turn

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:08.840
 into a pigment which in itself consumes and wastes oxygen.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:17.240
 So that got me interested in what the chronic exposure to polyunsaturated fats in the diet

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.560
 is doing to people.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:29.880
 And poisons such as your mold poisoning, all these poisonings of different sources chemically

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:36.400
 or physically, they all end up acting like estrogen in that they poison your ability

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.400
 to use oxygen.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.400
 Wow, I didn't even think about that.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.680
 I didn't even think about it really being like an estrogen in my body and that makes

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:51.600
 complete sense because estrogen does put weight on your body and I changed nothing.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:57.400
 In fact I exercised the same, I ate the exact same and yet I kept putting on weight and

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.080
 I was like, "This is not me.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.080
 I'm a nutritionist.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.120
 I know how to heal my body.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.080
 I know how to feed my body."

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.080
 And yet nothing was working.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.000
 It was like I was fighting a losing battle.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.960
 So that's so interesting that the mold actually acted like an estrogen.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.560
 Are there other things that also act like estrogens in our body too?

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:19.880
 I know there's xenoestrogens and obesogens and things like BPA plastics and stuff but

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:24.000
 maybe there's other things that people don't think of that are acting like estrogens.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:37.880
 In the 1930s soot was found to be highly estrogenic and that explains why smoke is such a carcinogen.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:42.240
 It simply is a very intense estrogen.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:55.040
 From a gob of black soot you can extract many different estrogens that work just like the

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.600
 manufactured synthetic estrogens.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:09.000
 Some of the research companies were using soot derivatives to discover new estrogen

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 products.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.600
 Soot is a type of demoxyphen, the anti-estrogen so-called, which itself has some estrogen

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.600
 effects.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:25.960
 It grew out of that research of why soot is estrogenic.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:36.480
 And any uricin, anything that stimulates the cell so intensely that the oxidative system

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:42.080
 can't keep up or anything that interrupts the use of oxygen.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:51.120
 My recent newsletter on particulate, especially nanoparticles, much smaller like a tenth the

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.160
 size of a bacteria or smaller.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:28:01.760
 These things are, some of them occur naturally in sandstorms and such.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:14.560
 But industry smoke output, traffic, the friction of tires on pavement, the condensed materials

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:21.880
 from the smoke of vehicle traffic.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:33.360
 And not only these somewhat natural powdered materials put into the atmosphere, but the

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:41.560
 industry has discovered that nanoparticles are very convenient additives to, for example,

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:47.320
 thicken shampoo and toothpaste, even to thicken food.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:53.720
 And it's permitted to use them as food additives.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:29:01.200
 But when they're absorbed through the lungs or through the intestine or even through the

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:10.480
 skin, they enter cells and as an insoluble particle, if they have just the right shape,

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.240
 they act as a constant stimulating irritant to the cell.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:25.640
 And that sort of disproportion between stimulation or irritation and the ability to supply energy,

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:31.280
 that has an estrogenic and potentially carcinogenic action.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.280
 Wow.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:38.240
 And some of these toxins in our environment you're talking about, would those also be

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.240
 in supplements?

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.240
 Oh, that's a horrifying thing.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:55.080
 Some of the titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide, some of it is larger particles which are not

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.520
 so toxic, but still not safe.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:07.200
 But these, even though they think they're putting in a larger granular material, these

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:12.080
 very often contain the nanoparticles that are extremely toxic.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:21.840
 And if you look at ingredients of vitamins, minerals, all kinds of supplements and drugs,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.720
 you very often see one or the other or both titanium dioxide and silica.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.600
 Yeah, something to watch out for, for sure.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:38.760
 So that's why I really like Georgie's supplements, the Idea Labs, because he uses ingredients

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:44.920
 that are, none of those contain any sort of silica or anything that's really potentially

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.920
 harmful.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.440
 So I appreciate his stuff and I know that you probably do as well.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:31:00.640
 An example of what the particles are known to do, for just about a hundred years, vaccines

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:11.440
 have been found to be more active in promoting immunity if they contain aluminum hydroxide,

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:20.600
 which forms these very tiny particles which activate inflammation, generalized inflammation

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:30.280
 produced by those particles arouses your body to become immune to whatever germ and its

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.040
 infection happens to be present at the same time.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:44.080
 So the medical industry has known for a hundred years that nanoparticles promote inflammation,

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:52.680
 but they're very reluctant to acknowledge that we should be taking them out of our food

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.960
 rather than putting them in.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.960
 Yeah, so there's that stressor again, and then stress is again going to elevate the

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:05.160
 estrogen as well, and people wonder why we're getting fatter as a nation, so that's interesting

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.160
 too.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.120
 And talking about that, like, okay, so let's talk diets.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.960
 Are there diets out there that are actually estrogenic too?

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.560
 Are there certain diets that are kind of popular these days that could actually be hurting

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:21.000
 people as far as promoting estrogen versus helping them?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:32.480
 Yeah, the polyunsaturated fats are made more active by estrogen, but they in themselves

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.480
 intensify estrogen activity.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:44.480
 Even without estrogen, you'll get estrogen-like effects from any free radical entry, for example,

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.760
 but you have this very strong interaction.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:33:00.080
 The estrogen that you have is made more intense by the presence of especially the omega-3

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:09.440
 fatty acids, but both minus-6 and minus-3 polyunsaturated fats promote the effects of

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.440
 estrogen.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:22.120
 It's been known for about 40 years that their carcinogenicity involves interaction

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.760
 with the estrogen system.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:30.760
 And so what are the most offending PUFAs or polyunsaturated fats?

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:35.680
 Which would you say are the most offending that people are regularly consuming?

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:48.080
 Well, around 1950, the food industry had a lot of cottonseed oil that otherwise would

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:54.240
 have been wasted because it was no longer needed for the paint industry when petroleum

00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:00.040
 chemistry started producing paint bases.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:11.680
 So these seed oils were turned into an American basic food material in the 1950s to dispose

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.880
 of industrial waste, really.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:23.160
 But it became a big industry, telling people that they were essential nutrients, and not

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:31.240
 only essential, but they were somehow to be therapeutic, preventing heart disease.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:39.920
 So they called it the heart-protective diet, high in the omega-6 fatty acids.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:48.560
 But a big study with veterans found that not only cancer, but heart disease itself was

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:57.000
 increased by eating the so-called heart-protective diet with the so-called essential fatty acids.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 That was the turning point where people started turning against the N-6 fats as the essential

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:15.920
 fatty acids and turning towards the N-3, characterized by fish oil, for example, but produced by

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.440
 algae.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:29.680
 Since about 1970, there has been recognition that the soy oil, cottonseed oil, safflower

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:39.840
 seed oil, canola, all of the N-6 rich oils are carcinogenic and cause heart disease and

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.160
 all other degenerative diseases.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:55.400
 But the industry, for example, the fish industry had a lot of polluting waste.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:04.560
 The Environmental Protection Agency criticized, said they had to do something to stop polluting

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.520
 the bays and surrounding landfills with the fish waste.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:21.120
 That was about the time fish oil was discovered to be a health food.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:30.800
 There is one advantage the N-3 oils have over the N-6 oils, is that they are extremely unstable

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:40.360
 and they block the effects of the N-6 as far as producing pro-inflammatory prostaglandins

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.360
 goes.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:52.920
 So you do get an anti-inflammatory effect for the first few months from fish oil because

00:36:52.920 --> 00:37:01.640
 it interferes, poisons the enzymes that make the prostaglandins that produce inflammation.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:15.400
 But the extreme oxidative instability of the N-3 oils means that, for example, acrolein

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:30.160
 is one of the toxic by-products of various food preparation processes, but it's the worst

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:36.240
 breakdown product of the fish oil category, N-3, the essence.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:45.920
 There are several others that are the breakdown products that are reactive, aldehydes, hydroxynone,

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:57.680
 enal, and several others come both from the N-6 and the N-3 fatty acids.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:07.840
 Acrolein, for example, is known to poison sperm cells and oocytes.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:20.320
 The development of the ovum is impaired, tending to increase the risk of birth defects, both

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:27.320
 in men and women, the acrolein and related breakdown products of the polyunsaturated

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:38.920
 fats are poisoning the next generation as well as the person who is accumulating them.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:53.960
 In the growth process, the placenta is a thoroughly powerful filter against anything toxic getting

00:38:53.960 --> 00:39:00.400
 into the developing embryo.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:10.600
 The energy that provides the growth of the embryo is primarily glucose, so a slightly

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:20.840
 diabetic mother is tending to accelerate the growth of the embryo because glucose is the

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.840
 main growth energy.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:30.920
 But if you give the mother supplements of fish oil, some of this, enough of it gets

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:38.960
 through the barrier of the placenta to slow the development, cause a reduced birth weight

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.960
 and reduced brain function.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:49.960
 Despite the evidence going back more than 40 years in animal studies showing this toxic

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:59.800
 effect on the developing brain, they are still adding it to a baby formula and promoting

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:07.040
 it as a brain growth factor rather than a brain poison.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:17.640
 When a baby is born, a healthy baby shows signs of being deficient in the polyunsaturated

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:30.400
 fatty acids and that's taken as opportunity to sell fish oil for baby food.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:41.800
 But as the baby grows, it starts accumulating and building some of this polyunsaturated

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:51.120
 fat into its brain, but as it grows, its brain is enlarging and so from birth to age 20,

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:58.080
 there is only a slow accumulation of polyunsaturated fat in the brain.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:07.120
 But when the growth process slows off around the age of 20, the food fats tend to accumulate

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:15.560
 in the fatty tissue and in the brain, which is most of the substance is fat rather than

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.560
 protein in the brain.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:30.840
 So from the age of 20 to middle age, there is a steady increase of the N-3 fats in the

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:43.880
 brain and in proportion to the amount of PUFA in the brain, especially N-3, the metabolic

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.120
 rate, the oxidative metabolism slows down.

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:57.600
 So a baby's brain is oxidizing at a very high speed and the first few years of life, kids

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.480
 are extremely capable of learning.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:07.720
 By the first grade, a kid knows about 6,000 words of their native language.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:19.360
 But if you ask someone to learn that many words of a foreign language, it's going to

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:23.840
 be a lot slower at an older age.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:35.120
 At the age of 20, learning and oxidative metabolism both start declining at a faster rate and

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:40.000
 go on for the rest of the person's life.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:51.360
 With the decline of cognitive ability corresponding to the decline of oxidative metabolism and

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:58.360
 the decline of being in proportion to the accumulated polyunsaturated fats in the brain,

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.360
 they're stored in the form of esters with cholesterol.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:12.560
 One of their functions that is harmful is that they interfere with the natural function

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:19.680
 of cholesterol in the brain, which is a normal stabilizing factor in the brain.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:25.240
 And I think if people will realize that the first food for baby is actually breast milk,

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.880
 which is 50 to 60 percent saturated fat, they would see that if there was a creator that

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:36.160
 was willing to devise that our first food is saturated fat, they'd see that the polyunsaturated

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.360
 really don't have a place for us, correct?

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:51.440
 Yes, and the amount of PUFA in a mother's blood corresponds pretty closely to the amount

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.440
 of estrogen.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:44:01.720
 So if she has too much estrogen, she won't produce enough milk.

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:12.320
 And it has been used pretty widely to stop lactation for women who don't want to breastfeed.

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:21.680
 But in proportion to the estrogenicity the woman is experiencing, her blood will be enriched

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.000
 with polyunsaturated fats.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.200
 And so, okay, one other thing then.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:31.680
 So we talked diet and certain foods, but what about people that are actually doing that

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.400
 diet of intermittent fasting to where they're fasting regularly and not eating?

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.320
 What kind of stressor is that on the system?

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.520
 Is it something that's beneficial or not?

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:54.240
 If you're eating a very bad diet, not eating it is beneficial in the sense that you're

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.680
 not poisoning yourself during that time.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:12.840
 But you have to consider the context, such as how good is the diet that you're not eating?

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:23.680
 And the hours of darkness usually are the hours when people are careful not to eat if

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.000
 they're in that system.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.080
 And blood sugar normally falls during the hours of darkness.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:39.640
 And that is compensated by a rise in the free fatty acids in the bloodstream.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:47.040
 And that's the same pattern that happens when you're under stress in the daytime.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:59.600
 Anytime you are having more stimulation or irritation or burden of work demand, for example,

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:04.880
 then you have stored glycogen as energy to meet it.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:13.560
 When the glycogen is depleted, you are forced to mobilize free fatty acids from storage

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:17.280
 and to start oxidizing those for energy.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:25.400
 And that requires more oxygen per unit of energy produced.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:39.640
 And so it tends to create a deficiency of glucose that leads to a waste of glucose because

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:48.320
 the fat metabolism is a strain on the ability to deliver oxygen to the system.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:54.880
 And when you aren't getting enough oxygen to the system, your body recognizes that the

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.760
 problem is that you aren't oxidizing glucose.

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:03.560
 And so it starts turning protein to glucose.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:11.960
 And it turns out that lactic acid rises even in the diabetic, for example, whose problem

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:18.000
 is exactly that they can't oxidize glucose.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:26.360
 Lactic acid, which is a waste of glucose, it appears in the blood.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:33.480
 When you're under stress, the rise of lactic acid is a good indicator of how much stress

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.480
 you're under.

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:44.240
 But every night as you mobilize free fatty acids, as your stored glycogen runs out, you

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:49.320
 start going into this stress state, producing lactate.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:55.240
 And that causes progressive damage of the mitochondria.

00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:07.800
 In aging, if you look at the loss of bone matter in women, especially in the 30s and

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:16.320
 40s, the bone that's being destroyed shows up in the urine as calcium.

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:25.640
 Most of the day's bone destruction, which is just one sign of the aging degenerative

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:33.120
 process, most of the calcium shows up in the morning urine, showing that aging and degeneration

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.320
 happens during the night.

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:44.480
 And that stress physiology during the night is because we have run out of glycogen.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:56.000
 And the longer you go without eating, the more you can rely on the inefficient fat oxidation

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.520
 rather than glycogen and glucose.

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:06.520
 And a lot of people might be interested to hear that you are not really a fan of fat

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.680
 burning for energy.

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.240
 So talk to me about that.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.760
 I love your philosophy behind it, but I want to hear it straight from you.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:26.160
 If you look at the difference between a woman's blood tests and a man's, most people would

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:33.760
 say since men have bigger muscles and bigger bones, you would assume that men have more

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.360
 growth hormone in their blood than women do.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:45.800
 But someone recently saw that the methods used in testing growth hormone that showed

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:53.440
 that women having maybe twice as much growth hormone as men, that was a mistaken technology.

00:49:53.440 --> 00:50:02.520
 They found an 80 times greater growth hormone in women than in men.

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.560
 This is an effect of estrogen.

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:13.520
 Estrogen causes chronically high mobilization of pre-fatty acids in the blood.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:20.040
 And that is compensated by this extremely high production of growth hormone that is

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:28.320
 why women are to a great extent protected from that chronic exposure.

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:34.000
 But that's an effect of estrogen dominance.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:44.760
 And so to the extent that you can minimize that, you can reduce that fat oxidizing chronic

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.040
 degenerative process.

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:54.360
 And so in that manner, you're more of a fan of the glucose system.

00:50:54.360 --> 00:51:00.520
 So you actually advocate for people taking in things that will build their glycogen and

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:05.360
 consuming carbohydrates because carbohydrates make carbon dioxide in our body.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.960
 And can you tell us, you know, these are maybe some ways we can start mitigating some of

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:15.320
 this stress and maybe how many people have been on these low carb diets that have kind

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:20.520
 of become part of the problem and maybe what they could do to mitigate some of this stress

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:23.840
 and maybe it starts with having some forms of sugar.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:24.840
 Yes?

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:25.840
 Yes.

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:33.240
 I mean, at the end of the 19th century, first a doctor in Paris and then one in England

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:42.480
 cured several of their patients by feeding them as much sugar as they desired.

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:51.720
 The traditional method they saw patients wasting away with diabetes and craving sugar, they

00:51:51.720 --> 00:52:00.040
 called it the sugar disease and so they would lock away the sugar and feed them fat and

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:06.120
 meat and they wouldn't assimilate it properly and they would die.

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:13.080
 And these two doctors found that feeding them as much sugar as they craved, which would

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:22.160
 be about 12 ounces a day of highly refined pure sugar just added to a regular diet, cured

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.160
 their patients.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:33.920
 And if you look at the function of the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin, free

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:41.160
 fatty acids kill those cells and the free fatty acids are mobilized when you aren't

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:48.280
 having either sugar in the blood or the ability to oxidize the sugar.

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:56.760
 So the presence of free fatty acids is constantly killing the beta cells which are constantly

00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:02.360
 regenerating as far as there is glucose available.

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:10.360
 But glucose is a factor which supports the regeneration and differentiation of new insulin

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:11.360
 producing cells.

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:26.280
 And so what the French and English doctors 140 years ago discovered was that the function,

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:33.800
 all of their normal sugar regulating functions came back when they interrupted that destructive

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:44.120
 process of what happens when you're craving sugar because you are using it inefficiently.

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:49.080
 I'm just so happy to hear you say that because it's so common sense if people will think

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:54.520
 about it since every cell of our body requires and especially the brain runs off of glucose,

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.080
 that's its preferred fuel.

00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:01.440
 But the mainstream now you're hearing is keto and low carb and all of that and yet the people

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:06.720
 that are coming to me off of keto and low carb are saying, "I'm exhausted, I don't feel

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:12.000
 well, I can't handle stress, I can't work out anymore, I love eating low carb but I

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.440
 don't know if it's working for me anymore."

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:15.440
 What would you say to that?

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:27.840
 The brain and muscles as well as the liver have to store glycogen to work and if you're

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:38.920
 forced to make glucose to put back into those stores, you're doing it at the expense of

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.000
 some part of your body.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:50.120
 Turning muscle tissue into glucose for example will keep you alive but it's degrading all

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:55.200
 of your functional tissues to use them to make glycogen.

00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:03.440
 Without glycogen, your brain basically is what happens when a person is deprived of

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.440
 sleep.

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:16.120
 If they're kept awake, they start becoming confused, can't think properly and finally

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:19.960
 would die if they didn't get back to sleep.

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:28.120
 Sleep is a process that allows the glycogen to be restored so that the brains can start

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:34.560
 functioning on a pure glucose regime.

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:39.240
 I'm living proof of that because any time I've ever done, even for a healing phase like

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:45.800
 of keto or carnivore, I did carnivory for a while just to try to heal because I was

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:50.840
 at a loss of how to heal from the toxic mold and my sleep always suffered but the minute

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:55.760
 I added carbs back in, it was like all of a sudden my sleep would just dial itself back

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:56.760
 in.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:00.800
 So isn't that so interesting that our body really is telling us in so many ways.

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:18.640
 Mentioning the meat eating, that's a very important side of what's going on when you're

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.640
 interfering with the glucose metabolism.

00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:27.840
 The parathyroid gland is activated to secrete its hormone by phosphate and meat has an extremely

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:33.120
 high concentration of phosphorus relative to calcium.

00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:41.320
 Beans and grains are similar, extreme phosphate excess.

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:47.440
 Green vegetables and milk which is made from green vegetables ultimately.

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:55.560
 The cows harvest the magnesium and calcium rich leaves and put that into the milk.

00:56:55.560 --> 00:57:03.160
 So milk has a very favorable high calcium to phosphate ratio and that suppresses calcium,

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:09.640
 suppresses the parathyroid hormone while phosphate activates it.

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:18.880
 Vitamin D is needed for calcium to do that and the parathyroid hormone when it's high,

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:22.240
 it mobilizes calcium out of your bones.

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:28.480
 That happens primarily during the night and is accelerated with aging.

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:37.040
 The action of taking calcium out of your bones happens to put it into the soft tissues, into

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:42.000
 your muscles, blood vessels, heart, brain, everything.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:51.680
 All the soft tissues tend to calcify as your diet is not getting enough calcium and magnesium

00:57:51.680 --> 00:58:00.560
 and vitamin D but getting too much phosphate relatively.

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:07.960
 This mismanagement of calcium goes into the mitochondria, does almost exactly the same

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:10.720
 thing that the polyunsaturated fats do.

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:26.200
 In fact, the high parathyroid hormone activates the rancidity of PUFA, N-6 and N-3 fatty acids

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:32.160
 degenerate when your parathyroid hormone is high.

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:41.720
 And low thyroid function increases your thyroid stimulating hormone and the whole process

00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:53.440
 of being hypothyroid and activating your pituitary, that synergizes with the parathyroid hormone.

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:58.560
 So you really can't think of thyroid function and parathyroid function separately.

00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:06.080
 Apparently that's why the glands are located in the same place because they're handling

00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.080
 the same physiology.

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:20.600
 The TSH activates your parathyroid hormone and both of those are reflecting an imbalance

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:21.600
 in your diet.

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.600
 Too much PUFA, too much phosphate.

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:29.600
 And that's exactly what a lot of the fad diets are emphasizing.

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:40.600
 Meat and nuts and grains, for example, rather than green vegetables, fruits and milk.

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:46.920
 You know, it's almost like I had to listen to my body because when I did the carnivore

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:51.920
 approach I felt better but there came a point in time when my body was telling me, "You

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.400
 have to start eating differently.

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:57.680
 You have to stop eating so much meat and you have to add in some seasonal variation of

00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.680
 carbohydrates."

00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:02.760
 So that's what I did and that's when the healing really began.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:08.240
 So I felt like the carnivore approach helped me initially but then I felt like I knew inherently

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.840
 what I needed to do.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:18.280
 And you mentioned avoiding the PUFAs and also increasing our sugar consumption.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:24.720
 But as far as lifestyle, dietary, environmental things, what can we do to start mitigating

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.320
 some of this stress and people can really begin to heal?

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.840
 What would your recommendations be?

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.280
 Frequent snacks.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:43.720
 Not letting yourself go too long without eating is something that's helpful.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:55.480
 Having some fruit and milk or cheese at hand so you don't get too hungry.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:00.720
 But getting enough sunlight is helpful.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:07.760
 The long waves, the red and orange waves that penetrate right through your tissues, reduce

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:14.480
 the free radicals that are produced by PUFA and too much phosphate and so on.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:23.560
 And the ultraviolet makes the vitamin D that helps you handle sugar and calcium.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.760
 And what about lifestyle strategies?

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:31.680
 What do you recommend for people as far as mitigating the stress lifestyle-wise?

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:41.680
 The most important thing is to figure out what is important in your life and work towards

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:52.240
 doing what you really think is important and considering the necessities, the horrible

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.600
 work that you might have to do.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:04.880
 Consider that as only a stepping stone to doing something more sane and productive.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:05.880
 I love that.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.200
 Yeah, find beauty appreciation in everything because even if it's a job that you can't

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.440
 get out of that you don't love, at least you can know that it's providing for your family

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.800
 and you can look at it with a positive attitude.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:26.600
 If you can have some kind of a perspective in the long range that is meaningful for your

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:36.880
 life that can make the stress attached to the immediate things disappear as long as

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:42.800
 you're well fed and have the energy to maintain that long range vision.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.280
 Yeah, for sure.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:50.200
 And what about, since you talk about the importance of the thyroid and how important it is, what

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:56.200
 in order to kind of help our thyroids function more optimally, what would you recommend?

01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:03.880
 The most important thing is to completely eliminate all of the liquid vegetable oils,

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:16.320
 canola, soy, cottonseed... all those, and to drastically reduce the seeds and nuts and natural foods that contain alot of them

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:36.440
 and to avoid the fatty fish, and the low-fat fish...cod, and sole, oysters, squid... are very low in the omega-3 fats and so they are safer.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:47.080
 Very good. Well I've held you here quite enough time I guess, we've been a little over an hour, but, before I let you go, how can people learn more about you?

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:57.720
 I know there is even a website called the Ray Peat forum, where there's a lot of people kinda picking up what you're putting down but I don't know that you're actually there right?

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.760
 No, I never participated in that.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:12.320
 Ok, as far as, I know they can go to raypeat.com and they can find all of your blog posts there as well, can you tell them about your newsletter as well?

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:24.200
 Yeah, it's published every other month, so a 12 issue subscription is for 2 years and that's $28 by email.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:30.200
 Yeah, and I'll be sure to include the information for that in the show notes as well.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:37.200
 Dr. Peat, you've been more than generous with your knowledge and your time and I just really appreciate everything you've done,

01:04:37.200 --> 01:06:43.200
 and I wanted to say, if you would be willing to share with my listeners your age, because I really am so impressed with how many years you've been doing nutrition.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.200
 How old are you?

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:48.200
 Eighty-two. Eighty-two. and you are... I just wish I had a penny-sized amount of the knowledge that's in your head,

01:04:48.200 --> 01:05:04.200
 so hopefully you'll keep podcasting with me if we can do this again I'd love that, because I have more and more and more of what I want to talk to you about.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:18.200
 Could we do that some time? Oh sure. Great! Thank you so much, and, yeah, so you guys check him out at raypeat.com and be sure to even send him an email,

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:24.200
 I know sometimes he's able to check emails if you have a pressing question, but otherwise be sure to signup for that newslettter because

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:29.200
 he's got some great topics that come out in those that are just a plethora of information.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:39.200
 Can I mention that to get the newsletter it's raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:45.200
 Ok great, yeah, and i'll put that in the show notes and I think there's a way they can pay through paypal to do that too, so.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:53.200
 Wonderful, thanks again, thanks for listening everyone, and yeah, stay tuned for the next time, bye for now!

01:05:53.200 --> 01:06:18.200
