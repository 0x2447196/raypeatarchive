00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:17.280
 Just very quickly, it's the winter solstice here, December 21st, 2018, and we've got a full moon and an urcid meteor shower.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:26.000
 Pretty cool, huh? Okay, so, beautiful, clear evening outside, and at that time of the year when we have the shortest days,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.760
 we can look forward to increasing day length from here within a couple of days or so.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.960
 So, every third Friday of the month, I guess, I think for the last 14 or 15 years, I was thinking about it on the way in,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:48.320
 we've done this monthly show, which is a live show, broadcasted from the KMUD studio in Garboville,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:58.160
 Redway, sorry, not Garboville, in Redway, California, and every third Friday of the month, we decide on a topic based on medicine,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:09.760
 herbal medicine, alternative medicine, nutrition, dietary advice, etc., which we believe is a good alternative to standard medical practice,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:19.280
 but which we still recognize medical practice as not being out of the question and certainly has a lot of benefits.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.520
 It's just that some of it is very questionable. We've been very lucky to have been joined for the last 10 years now, I think,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:39.040
 by Dr. Raymond Peat, who's a research endocrinologist, a scientist in the true sense of the word, very much involved in real research.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:47.200
 I just want to say that when people say they've been researching something recently, they typically mean they've been looking at the internet and googling it

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:56.080
 and getting information wherever they can. I think in the empirical sense of the word, research really involves digging into a lot of literature,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:04.720
 a lot of documents and scientifically analyzing the data for congruence or obvious mistakes.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:18.560
 I know Dr. Peat has spent the last 45 years or more after his PhD doing a continued research post-PhD, post-doctorate in nutrition, health,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.000
 and how to really help yourself using very simple methods. He doesn't advocate anything that's super expensive.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.200
 It's really very common sense. I think in a lot of ways, the best help is to avoid some of the things that we're told is good for us

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.160
 rather than adding more things into our diet. Without further ado, let me just introduce Dr. Peat.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.120
 You there, Dr. Peat?

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.840
 Yes.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.200
 Hi. Thanks so much for joining us again. As always, for the benefit of those people who perhaps have never heard you before,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.320
 or heard of you, or tuned in, as we're always getting new listeners and emails from people that say they just came across it for the first time,

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.960
 would you just outline your academic background to where you are now before we get into the night show?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:19.520
 First, in the 1950s and early 1960s, I was studying literature and painting mostly. Then, 1968 to '72, I did a graduate program for a PhD in biology.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:32.800
 Talking about research, my approach to research probably is influenced by my literature background, thinking of propaganda analysis,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.640
 sensitivity to how people use language and manipulate preconceptions and such.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.760
 Good point.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:54.560
 I think everyone looking at the internet has to spend more time thinking about propaganda analysis and how advertising has invaded the medical journals,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.800
 practically taking over many of the journals.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:10.080
 Absolutely. It's a lot of money involved, and we do mention this many times. Dr. Peat, just very quickly, your specialty, let me not put words in your mouth,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:19.680
 but just tell people what your specialism was, what it came to be when you graduated, what you looked at in research, and where you're at now.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:33.520
 My dissertation was on the biochemical changes involved in reproductive aging, working on the hamster uterus mostly,

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:46.240
 and seeing how many factors parallel aging in the biochemical pattern that they create.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:05:03.040
 Estrogen excess, progesterone deficiency, vitamin E deficiency, exposure to radiation all create the same typical age pattern of metabolism.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.960
 It's at its most extreme in cancer metabolism.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:17.120
 That was why I was so interested in Otto Farberg's work at the time.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:29.520
 When I was just starting in graduate school, American biochemists were turning against Otto Farberg despite his Nobel Prize,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.000
 because he was saying that cancer is a metabolic condition, not a gene mutation.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:50.640
 Now, 50 years later, finally the US and European cultures are coming around to looking at what Farberg did almost 100 years ago.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:57.840
 OK, good. So let me just tell people here that it's a live call-in show from 7.30 to 8 o'clock.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:06.160
 We'll take callers with questions hopefully related to this month's subject or continuing subject of skin cancer,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:16.240
 with some parallels with vitamin D and a little follow-up on the cholesterol-lowering statins.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.480
 We all know how bad they are for us, don't we?

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:26.240
 So the number if you live in the area or even if you're outside the area now, 707-923-3911.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.640
 So from 7.30 to 8 o'clock, we'll be taking callers who want to ask Dr. Peat questions about the subject that we're talking about,

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.400
 or if they have any other subjects relevant to alternative medicine or indeed his protocols.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.120
 Number again, 707-923-3911.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:52.000
 So Dr. Peat, I wanted to continue. Last month I had questions that I never did get a chance to ask you because we had so many people calling in.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:10.160
 But rather than just carrying straight off the questions, I wanted to make sure that I got some coverage for what was later revealed to me about an Italian MD by the name of Tullio Simoncini.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:17.120
 So he's an MD. He's been practicing for some time, although there's been controversy about him.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:28.560
 He's one of these doctors who essentially became quite alternative in his treatments and was struck off the medical register in the end.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.000
 So people can read about him and make your own mind up.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:42.240
 But I wanted to let people know in relation to the context of skin cancer, what he had been working with and doing to treat people.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:56.400
 And by all accounts, was getting very successful results with people, both with topical cancers, which we were covering, we're going to cover last month, but we're hopefully going to cover this month.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:08.960
 So the topical cancers from the basal cell carcinomas to the squamous cell carcinomas, actinic keratosis, malignant melanomas.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:15.280
 And he also treats internal cancers with a different protocol.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:30.000
 So I wanted to just talk a little bit about the treatment that he was advocating with people using a 7% iodine solution for topical cancers.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.400
 I think the other thing that's quite interesting is that a 7% solution for some reason is really not offered by very many people.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.240
 Seems like the average concentration is between two and five.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:46.000
 But there's something different, I guess, because the concentration is 7% and not two or five.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.560
 But there's something different about people that are selling this.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.600
 There's very few people doing it at 7%.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.600
 And if you look at the reviews, folks, I mean, you don't have to take my word for it.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:12.800
 But if you go to Amazon, you know, the beam off that sells just about everything to anybody, anytime, and look at 7% iodine, and then check the reviews from the people that have used it for skin cancers.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:33.120
 And I wanted to ask Dr. Peat his opinions about cancers and the treatment, current therapies, including the Mohs therapy, which is a therapy where they take successive layers of the tumor away and dissect them and basically go deeper and deeper until everything has been taken away and it's all good.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.880
 And then they stitch you up if you need it and everything's just fine and dandy.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.520
 I know Dr. Peat doesn't really believe in cutting any kind of cancer.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.480
 And he's got his own reasons and we'll ask him about that.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:10:11.360
 But what do you think about Tullio Simoncini's approach to cancers and his rationale that Candida albicans, which we probably all heard of, which is that yeast overgrowth that we all, most people actually have Candida anyway, but very few people really get a bad case of it because most immune systems are able to deal with it.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:17.280
 So some people have it in their mouth or under their armpits or in between their toes.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:29.280
 But he's stated categorically that cancer is actually based in a yeast and Candida albicans is essentially the organism responsible for it.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:38.240
 So Dr. Peat, do you have anything to put in about that in terms of being a tenable position?

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:46.880
 About 40 years ago, there was a big mania in the US blaming everything on Candida.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.840
 And that led me to study how it actually interacts.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:11:13.760
 And if you're under stress and hypothyroid and inclined towards diabetes or not being able to oxidize glucose thoroughly and tending to have high estrogen, it happens that all of those favor and attract Candida growth.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:27.840
 And so the presence of Candida coincides with hypothyroidism, estrogen excess and poor ability to oxidize glucose.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:46.880
 So it happens that inflammation and improper oxidation of glucose is typical of cancer metabolism more intensely than of simple stress metabolism.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:12:04.880
 So Simoncini is seeing something very central to the metabolism of cancer, which is intensified by the inflammation promoting effects of the Candida.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:24.560
 And Candida itself, besides being attracted to estrogen, estrogen is a sex hormone for the Candida fungus and it contains an enzyme which can aromatize male steroid hormones.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.880
 So it can become an amplifier of estrogen.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.160
 First, it's attracted to it and stimulated by it.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.360
 So it can convert testosterone into?

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:48.800
 Yeah, at least one of the precursor and steroid from the adrenal rather than from the gonads.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:13:16.960
 Okay. And so it's definitely in many ways an amplifier of cancer once it gets in a tissue and when the immune system is failing, the fungus can convert from a yeast form to a filament form and invade the tissues looking for sugar and estrogen.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.920
 So it's very commonly associated with cancers.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.960
 The sicker a person is, the weaker their immune system is.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:40.320
 And the less they are using their own glucose and they're producing themselves histamine and lactic acid in the tumor.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.320
 And both of these are attractive to the fungus.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:14:07.120
 And so if you simply increase the pH and do it with bicarbonate, which can converge to carbon dioxide, that helps to suppress the cancer promoting lactic acid formation by the tumor itself.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:19.920
 Okay. So he's really onto something and his critics really, most of them sound sort of nasty and hysterical.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:26.320
 Okay. Well, there's a couple of things I want to pull out from what you've said here.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:47.520
 I guess number one, last month we talked about a vitamin D deficiency and reports say that up to a billion people on the planet are vitamin D deficient and they're increasingly raising the vitamin D levels to reflect what would actually be a good level of vitamin D because they find now that it's so important in immune function.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:56.720
 And last month you mentioned something about the skin's immune system and the deficiency of vitamin D in the skin of people, especially as they get older.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:07.520
 And so that vitamin D deficiency, localized deficiency there would also play a part in formation of a skin cancer to allow it to be outside of the body's surveillance.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:17.520
 Yeah. And that follows from a cholesterol deficiency with aging, the ability to make cholesterol and the steroids goes down.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:26.520
 And so when the sunlight hits old skin, it makes much less vitamin D.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:43.520
 Just a few months ago in Poland, there was an interesting article on the so-called activated form of vitamin D, calcitriol or 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:16:05.520
 And they showed that it helps that vitamin D form, the active so-called form, suppresses immunity and creates the ideal environment for causing mammary gland cancer metastasis.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:24.520
 Wow. So hang on, you're saying the one, again, this was going to be another question that I had for you, but so now is probably a good time to ask you that you're saying the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is not actually the beneficial form, but that is the form in which people would use vitamin D, is it not?

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:41.520
 No, that's produced under stress. It's sort of the way the steroid hormones under extreme stress can emphasize the estrogen version of the steroid.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:17:01.520
 The calcitriol is the extreme stress form of vitamin D. It has its use under stress, but like estrogen, it easily becomes counterproductive and in the case of cancer, can promote the cancer spread.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:10.520
 Okay. So I think probably what I meant to say was that the calcitriol is the end of the metabolic pathway for production of vitamin D.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:24.520
 Yeah, and when you're well supplied with calcium and the vitamin D precursors or sunlight and cholesterol, you have a very low level of calcitriol.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:44.520
 Okay. Got it. So this again, okay, so the 1,25-dihydroxy is not what you want even though it's the end of the metabolic pathway, but that won't be reached if you have adequate levels of thyroid and the other thing you mentioned here, calcium.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:18:05.520
 Yeah, like pregnenolone is the precursor of the pathway that at its end point leads to estrogen and aldosterone and other end steroids, but if you take enough pregnenolone, you'll reduce those end products rather than increasing them.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:21.520
 Right. Okay, good. Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Obe Doctor on KMUD Gallivore 91.1 FM. From 7.30 until the end of the show, people are invited to call in with questions about this month's subject of skin cancer and indeed cancer metabolism per se.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:47.520
 And the number here is 707-923-3911. So from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in. So Dr. Peat, Tullio Simoncini, you say that he's onto something in his understanding or his positing this idea that the candida albicans is actually the culprit here behind cancers.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:19:03.520
 He actually shows on a couple of... There's a few YouTubes of him if people want to go to YouTube and type in Tullio Simoncini. His name is Tullio Simoncini.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:19.520
 There's a couple of YouTubes where he's showing... Because he's an MD, he's working with oncologists. In fact, I think he was an oncologist and that's how he got to be so opposed to the method or the methodology used in oncology to treat cancers.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:44.520
 But he saw that tumors invariably had white centers to them, white patches, white growths, and that this was candida albicans. And I think you've mentioned that candida is a very opportunistic infection and actually will be very, very quick to take residence in locations where it's not normally allowed to be in.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:59.520
 In the past, when I've talked to you about candida, you've said that really, and this is again, I think, poor misinformation from maybe the internet or word of mouth repeating the same mistake, but you do not want to starve the body of sugar, which is typically what they say for candida.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:13.520
 And that is, I think you've explained that, quote me if I'm wrong, but that the filamentous form is initiated when the fungal organism is actually deprived of sugar and it wants to go further into the tissues to pull more sugar out.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:38.520
 Yes, if it's happy in the intestine, it grows in the yeast form, having enough sugar. But when there's no sugar in the intestine and it starves, then it will attach itself to the surface of the intestine and then send out filaments to find sugar from the bloodstream or the cells.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:49.520
 Okay, so that was a little bit of the overview of that doctor's approach to topical skin cancers was using a 7% iodine solution.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:21:01.520
 Like I said, if people want to go to Amazon, look at 7% iodine and read the customer reviews, they're all positive and they all talk about how they had basal or squamous cell carcinomas and they've gone.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:11.520
 You know, given X amount of weeks of treatment with iodine, it's gone. Other people, obviously, with things like fungal situations, fungal nail or, you know, stubborn athlete's foot, etc.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:38.520
 I say much the same thing. I just wanted to talk a little bit about Simon Sini's work using intravenous injectable sodium bicarbonate. I know you're quite a big fan of sodium bicarbonate and CO2 and the whole concept of bicarbonate and how it's how it's helpful, not just in the context of being an alkalinizer, because I know you're not really on the acid alkaline bandwagon, as it were.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:49.520
 But you've got a much more scientific approach to the basis for alkalinizing or or indeed how possible that is to change your pH systemically.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:58.520
 But locally, I think for injecting that product around or into solid tumors is what is what Simon Sini has been working with.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:15.520
 And when the body when bicarbonate gets into the bloodstream, the sodium leaves in the urine and the bicarbonate is converted to carbon dioxide as it enters the cell.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:28.520
 And so it acidifies the intracellular environment, despite increasing the alkalinity temporarily of the bloodstream.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:46.520
 And the typical cancer metabolism has an alkaline intracellular pH. And so you're getting right at the heart of the problem when you increase the CO2 inside the cell.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:57.520
 And since the 18th century, carbon dioxide gas has been used to treat visible cancers such as ulcerated breast cancer.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:14.520
 And the Japanese are currently using it to treat cancers using that same principle that it acidifies the cell, turns off the growth mechanism and the production of lactic acid.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:33.520
 And several drug companies are working on enzyme inhibitors similar to acetazolamide, but things that they can patent to increase the internal acidity of cancers.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:46.520
 Just for the folks who maybe don't know about it, acetazolamide is something that you've said is useful for raising your own production of CO2 and if you're going to elevation or something like that can help you get ready for it.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:52.520
 Yeah, it causes the body to retain it and acidifies the whole body when you get a certain amount.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:58.520
 But intracellularly, that acidification turns off lactic acid production.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.520
 And lactic acid is the main carcinogen effectively.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.520
 Got it. Because it's an energy depletor, correct?

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.520
 Mm-hmm.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.520
 Okay. Well, you know, we do have actually a caller on the line here who's been waiting for five minutes or so.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.520
 So let me just firstly say people want to call in from 730 till the end of the show.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.520
 The number is 707-923-3911.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.520
 So caller, you're on the air. What's your question and where are you from?

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:40.520
 Well, I'm from Petrolia. I guess you might have answered my question because I have the crusty carcinoma skin cancer type of thing on my back of my hands and the side of my neck.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.520
 And I was wondering about what I could do to get rid of the scab of the crust on it.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:50.520
 And now you're telling me a 7% solution of iodine might be the solution.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:59.520
 Yeah. Yeah. If you go to Amazon, type in 7% iodine, read the customer reviews about it.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:06.520
 And then if you want, type in that doctor's name, Giulio Simoncini.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.520
 He's an Italian MD.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:15.520
 Like I said at the beginning of the show, he has actually been struck off the register because they've, you know, invariably called him a quack doing what he's doing,

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:24.520
 even though he has a lot of testimonials from people that have gotten over cancer, both skin cancers and solid tumors that were previously inoperable.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:30.520
 So it's again, it's one of those one of those paradoxes where there's somebody who's saying that something actually is very possible here.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:37.520
 He's being disavowed by the Medical Association because what he's doing is not in medical, regular medical practice.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:44.520
 So you can go ahead and search for the name Giulio Simoncini.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.520
 Yeah. No, Giulio begins with a T. So T-U-L-L-I-O.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:57.520
 Yeah. Giulio. T-U-L-L-I-O. And his last name is Simon, S-I-M-O-N-C-I-N-I. Giulio Simoncini.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.520
 C-I-N-I.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:06.520
 And then he'll cover, you can read, you know, what people that are supporting his rationale are talking about.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:12.520
 But 7% iodine has been used for some time here for topical skin cancers.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.520
 Great. Okay. Well, thank you very much. I enjoy your show.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:22.520
 Yeah, you're welcome. Okay. So we do have one more caller, I think, on the line. Okay, we have two more.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.520
 Okay. So caller, you're on the air. What's your question and where are you from?

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.520
 My name is Peter. I'm from San Francisco.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.520
 Hey, Peter. What's your question?

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.520
 I have a question about hypertonic liquids.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:40.520
 I've noticed a benefit from adding sugar to milk. I mean, sugar to milk and orange juice.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:46.520
 And I'm just wondering what the mechanism is for that, why that works.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.520
 Dr. Peat.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:27:02.520
 Hypotonic liquids hitting the stomach and intestine causes stress reaction and release, among other things, serotonin into the bloodstream.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:16.520
 And hypertonic things, if they're within reason, you can injure your stomach with like a big dose of salt or dry sugar.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.520
 It has a dehydrating influence.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:34.520
 But if it's a moderate hypertonicity, it has an anti-inflammatory effect, helps to regulate energy production, pH.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:48.520
 Various hypertonic solutions are being used in resuscitation now, rather than just increasing the blood volume with isotonic saline or glucose.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:56.520
 They use three or four or five times isotonic concentrations.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:08.520
 And the small volume, like a cup full of a hypertonic solution, has a very intense resuscitating effect in shock.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.520
 Great. Thank you.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.520
 All right. Thanks for your call, caller.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.520
 Okay. I think we have one or two more.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.520
 So, next caller, you're on the air. What's your question and where you're from?

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.520
 Yeah. Hi. My name is Dirk. I'm from Redway.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.520
 Okay. Very nice question.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:27.520
 Yeah. Well, my grandmother, 96-year-old, sedentary, indoors a lot.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.520
 I just learned to use, she might suffer from vitamin D deficiency.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:39.520
 She had a squamous cell in her nose, very persistent, from a scab that would fluff off and, you know, was bothering her.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.520
 It was causing a lot of itching.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.520
 And, you know, excising was the doctor's recommendation.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.520
 We opted against that because it would remove her entire nose, frankly.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:53.520
 So, we applied cannabis oil in an olive oil suspension.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.520
 Okay.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.520
 And within two weeks, it went away.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:02.520
 So, I'm wondering if you have any comments about the possible efficacy of the cannabis or was it the olive oil that did it?

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.520
 I mean, do you have any, you know, any idea about that?

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:15.520
 Yeah. Let's ask Dr. Peek. I know you've got certain opinions about cannabis and/or the olive oil.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:25.520
 Yeah. I'm inclined to think it's the olive oil that's therapeutic because it has so many anti-inflammatory effects.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:36.520
 I think the cannabis oil has some potentially pro-growth, pro-inflammatory components or effects.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:44.520
 Do you think that's the oleanolic component of the olive oil or do you think there's only one thing about it?

00:29:44.520 --> 00:30:05.520
 The things related to the cannabis, the characteristic, what are they called, the endogenous cannabinoids,

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:14.520
 anandamide I think is the endogenous one, it is a metabolite of a very unsaturated fatty acid

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:25.520
 and the effects that I've seen really are along the line of the polyunsaturated fatty acids themselves

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:32.520
 which as a group are amplifiers of the estrogen effect.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:39.520
 So not positive at all but you think the components within olive oil could well be beneficial.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:45.520
 Yeah. There are several things in it that I think can have a protective anti-cancer effect.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.520
 Within two weeks the tumor completely vanished.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.520
 Good. That's the main thing. All right. Thanks for your question.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.520
 We've got a couple more callers on the air.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:01.520
 People want to call in, like I said, from now until the end of the show, the number is 707-923-3911.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.520
 Dr. Raymond Peat is our guest. Skin cancer is the topic of this evening.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.520
 So caller, you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question?

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:12.520
 New York. Two questions on the topic.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:25.520
 First, on vitamin D, you mentioned PUFA and fish contain a lot of PUFA but not as bad as seed oils.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:32.520
 What about like sardines because it's like a whole fish so you're getting a lot of different type of minerals

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:39.520
 and also it seems like it's a pretty good source for vitamin D as well and perhaps bioavailable

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:46.520
 versus taking a pill which, you know, I know you mentioned cholesterol and sunlight

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:55.520
 but there might be other vitamins or other minerals that might be needed within the body to actually absorb that vitamin D.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:59.520
 I'm just thinking those might be available if you eat like a whole sardine.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:05.520
 So trying to figure out whether the PUFA in sardines is closer to halibut because I know you mentioned halibut.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.520
 It's a pretty good one. So that's one question.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:12.520
 Then the second one is related to the earlier comment that was mentioned on candida albicans.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:23.520
 If you have like fungal toe, I know I'll look up this Tulio MD, but Dr. Peat, what would you say to someone?

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:29.520
 Do they have to be really healthy to try to attack fungal toe given the comment that it could spread to another area

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.520
 and be more problematic in the body if you chase it out of your toe?

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.520
 Or how do you approach something like that? So those are my questions.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.520
 Thanks for your questions. So Dr. Peat, first question about sardines.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.520
 How do you rate sardines? The calcium content maybe from all the bones is probably beneficial,

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.520
 but what do you think about sardines?

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:57.520
 Very good general nutritional value including selenium and iodine and other trace minerals that all of the ocean organisms have.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:06.520
 But it does have a lot of the polyunsaturated, so I think maybe one meal a week is fine.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.520
 Okay. And then do you...

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.520
 Actually, I was asking about the vitamins. Is it also a good source of vitamin D or not?

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:24.520
 I don't know how much, but everything that is exposed to sunlight tends to have some of it.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.520
 Okay.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:36.520
 And then what's your other rationale for, as the caller says, chasing fungal organisms out from the nail bed by treating them into other areas?

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.520
 Is that even a possibility?

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:48.520
 No, I don't think that would happen if you're using something like 7% iodine on the infected nail.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:56.520
 It takes a long time to diffuse through a toenail, but it is a good fungus killer.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.520
 Okay, good. All right. Well, thanks for your call, caller.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.520
 We've got a couple more callers on the air, so let's get this next caller.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.520
 Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.520
 Hi, I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.520
 Hey, welcome.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.520
 Hi, I have a question not related to the topic.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.520
 It's a question about relationships.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:18.520
 I was in a very toxic relationship this year and found out that there was substance abuse,

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:25.520
 which led to a lot of the lying and manipulation and, unfortunately, cheating, which ultimately ended the relationship.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:32.520
 And I'm curious, Dr. Peat, about relationships, how do they affect individuals,

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:39.520
 and can they affect one's physiology, obviously, when there's stress involved?

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.520
 It's a very powerful stressor.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.520
 Right, I was just thinking the same thing.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:58.520
 Eating well can help to offset the stress, but the attitude, the way you interpret the experience,

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:10.520
 is also essential to see it as just one of the challenges of living, I think,

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:23.520
 and not interpreted in any way that impairs your understanding of yourself.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:29.520
 It should just be seen as one of the environmental challenges.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.520
 Very good.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.520
 Okay, so there you go.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.520
 Number one, it does cause a lot of stress, which we all know is bad for you,

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:43.520
 and that stress can lead to things like rapid weight loss because you go off food and just you don't feel good.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:49.520
 And number two, just not let that become a psychological damaging mechanism

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:53.520
 because it's just part of what we go through and how you deal with it.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.520
 Excellent answer, Dr. Peat.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.520
 Okay, so I think we have another caller on the air.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.520
 Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:07.520
 Hi, I am calling from Finland on the longest night of the year.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.520
 And my question was regarding to CO2.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:17.520
 I understand it was discussed previously on other shows that CO2 is beneficial,

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:26.520
 and I found out that they are selling for growers mostly bags, I think, of fungus, I suppose,

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.520
 which generates CO2.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:39.520
 And I was wondering if it could be a good idea to have those bags around the house to increase the CO2 level.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.520
 Presumably there's no spores with it too, right?

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.520
 I imagine.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.520
 Yeah, well, hopefully not. You'd be sitting there breathing that in day and night.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:53.520
 Anyway, Dr. Peat, did you hear all of that question?

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.520
 Not all of it. Where was the fungus?

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:01.520
 Yeah, just describe again. I mean, is it a bagged product? How does it release it?

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:08.520
 Exactly. I suppose it's a plastic bag of several kilograms or maybe, I don't know, six pounds or so.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.520
 Okay, and you just lay it on the soil?

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.520
 And I suppose that in there, there is some kind of fungus and something to feed it.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.520
 Okay. All right.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:21.520
 Yeah, I had a bag of masa arena from Mexico.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:31.520
 The humidity in Oregon started a fungus growth, and for about a year, it was hot and producing carbon dioxide.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:44.520
 So it's a very productive, passive way to increase the carbon dioxide in your bedroom, for example.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:54.520
 I don't think it emits anything seriously harmful other than the carbon dioxide is beneficial.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:38:04.520
 I don't think if it has a cloth enclosure, I don't think it's going to put out any spores.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.520
 Thank you very much.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.520
 Okay. Well, thank you for your call.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:16.520
 Okay, so the number if you live here or even if you don't live here, if you live in Finland, the number is 707-923-3911.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.520
 And I have a question. My name is Michael. I'm from Redway.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.520
 I might have missed this when I was dealing with collars,

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:27.520
 but I know a lot of people would have candida in our community and would go through the candida diet,

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.520
 which would involve starving it with no sugar.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:34.520
 So does that imply that you could get some sort of colon cancer or something from it latching on?

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.520
 And how do you get rid of it if you have the overgrowth?

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.520
 I've heard of some bacteria which eat it.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:45.520
 Yeah, given that we are on the subject of candida here being positively associated here with tumors and cancers,

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:52.520
 and the underlying belief is that you starve candida from sugar because everyone's demonizing sugar,

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:57.520
 which people always maintain is actually very good for you.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.520
 How do you see the treatment of candida?

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:07.520
 Just a pinch of flowers of sulfur if it's internal.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:14.520
 If it's on your cheek, you can rub it with your finger into the white spot.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:19.520
 Just wet your finger, dip it in the flowers of sulfur, rub it on.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:32.520
 Otherwise, if it's in your stomach or intestine, a pinch of it every day for three or four days is very reliable for cleaning it out of your intestine.

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:42.520
 If it's on your skin, genital or crotch area in general where it's living in the sweaty area,

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:46.520
 dusting the area with flowers of sulfur.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:59.520
 Or I had a whole body coverage of some kind of fungus when I was in a tropical area of Mexico

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:09.520
 and someone from the Amazon had a similar experience and she told me about the 10% sulfur soap.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.520
 One bath eradicated it.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:19.520
 It's amazingly effective against skin candida infections.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:27.520
 And is flower of sulfur, is that the same thing that winemakers or wine growers, the powder they put on their grapes?

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:31.520
 I think they use a cruder, cheaper form of it.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:37.520
 It's a good fungus killer on plants, on roses and grapes.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.520
 Just elemental sulfur.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:45.520
 I think they sublime it. For some reason, I think that's the relevance with flowers of sulfur.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:52.520
 But you can get it. I know that we've gotten the local pharmacy here a few years back now to get it.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:59.520
 It was one of those things you could get easily at one point in time, but like so many things, like iodine even,

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:07.520
 become relegated to the rather more profitable and toxic versions of the latest craze.

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:14.520
 So yeah, anyway, flowers of sulfur either topically or using a medicated sulfur soap.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:19.520
 Okay, so we have one more caller on the air. Caller, where are you from? What's your question?

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:23.520
 I live in Pepperwood.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:35.520
 My question is, I was just recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's, which is hypothyroidism.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.520
 I have two questions.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:43.520
 I am reading a book by Anthony William called "Thyroid Healing,"

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:50.520
 and I wanted to know if Dr. Peat had read that and what he thought of it.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:42:04.520
 My other question is, my symptom is erratic blood pressures, no pattern to day or night,

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:13.520
 and just what he would suggest to support thyroid function and maybe stabilizing the blood pressure.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.520
 Have you had your TSH measured?

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:22.520
 Yes. It was high. So I've had two blood works done.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:38.520
 It was 5, the TSH, and then I also had the free T3 and free T4.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:48.520
 And the practitioner that I saw said that it was in the normal range.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:43:01.520
 According to another book that I have been reading, it was not thought to be in the normal range.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.520
 Do you know what the values were? Do you have the labs with you?

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:11.520
 I don't. They were higher than--

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:19.520
 So I'm reading--the other book I'm reading is "The End of Alzheimer's,"

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:31.520
 and the ranges that were given in that book, my ranges were--for one, it was lower,

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.520
 and for the other, it was a little bit higher.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:44.520
 Did you--you actually got a diagnosis of Hashimoto's based on just the TSH or antibody studies that they did or anything else?

00:43:44.520 --> 00:44:06.520
 They said that my magnesium was also in a low range and not too much alpha.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:17.520
 It was a difficult appointment, and I called back and got more information over the phone.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.520
 Caller, you're fading out there.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.520
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:26.520
 What was suggested to you as a way forward? Just before we asked Dr. Peat his advice.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.520
 Wait three months and come back.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.520
 Okay, great.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:36.520
 Okay, so I think the main question is, Dr. Peat, the erratic blood pressure she's talking about with no seeming pattern to it

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:42.520
 and a TSH of five, which is a little outside the reference range, and what do you think about that?

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:50.520
 I know you've dealt with very few people over your lifetime with true Hashimoto's, but what would you speak to that?

00:44:50.520 --> 00:45:04.520
 Well, Broderbarnes in his books advocated the use of temperature as an important basis for diagnosing functional hypothyroidism.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:16.520
 Back in the 1930s, if we used their definitions of hypothyroidism, about 40 percent of Americans would fit their definitions.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:29.520
 In the 1940s, the drug industry came in with some ways of chemically diagnosing hypothyroidism.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:41.520
 It happened that they were completely meaningless biologically, but they convinced everyone that 95 percent of the population is not hypothyroid.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.520
 And this is a thyroid stimulating hormone you found?

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:55.520
 They were using a protein-bound iodine, which has absolutely no relation to how you're experiencing your thyroid.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:06.520
 And about 20 years later, when that was thrown out as completely meaningless, they switched to the TSH,

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:18.520
 which is the, they call it the gold standard of thyroid diagnosis, but they completely neglect the fact that stress lowers your TSH,

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:33.520
 so that you can be under such intense stress with high cortisol that your TSH can be down near zero while your thyroid gland is producing nothing.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:39.520
 Also, they neglect that TSH is an inflammation promoter.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:53.520
 It in itself creates hypertension by causing inflammation directly in the blood vessels as well as in the bone marrow and every place it's been studied.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.520
 It has harmful tissue effects.

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:07.520
 One of the effects of the thyroid hormone on your blood pressure is simply that it suppresses TSH.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:26.520
 People in a population that was determined to be generally healthy without heart disease or cancer, their TSH was 0.04 or less.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:33.520
 So they were all in what would be diagnosed as a hyperthyroid state.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:46.520
 So many people now are saying that the upper limit of TSH should not be higher than 2.0.

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:56.520
 And the T4 and T3 in the bloodstream can't be interpreted all by themselves.

00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:08.520
 You have to know what the reverse T3 is because it can interfere with the activity of the T3 itself.

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:19.520
 Okay, and then how about I think without going any further for this particular person in terms of understanding it, what would you speak to their erratic blood pressure?

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.520
 Do you know what your blood pressure is?

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.520
 Yes, it varies.

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:38.520
 But it's been typically in the 140s, usually the bottom number can be 79, 85, 93.

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:45.520
 My pulse is I believe high at 70, 74.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:52.520
 Sometimes it's lower than that, you know, 52.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:59.520
 It's good to check your temperature and pulse rate when you first wake up and then later in the day.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:13.520
 Broda Barnes believes that the waking temperature should be very close to 98 degrees and then the mid-afternoon temperature should be closer to 98.6.

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.520
 Okay.

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:28.520
 And my own experience, when I stopped taking thyroid for a while, my blood pressure has gone up to something like 170 over 110.

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:39.520
 And other times as low as most doctors wouldn't believe it, but 55 over 28.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.520
 Wow.

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:43.520
 Did you feel bad when it was high?

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.520
 No, I felt fine.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:52.520
 But I got back to taking more sugar and thyroid quickly when I saw how high it was.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.520
 Wow.

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:56.520
 I see.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.520
 Well...

00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:01.520
 If you want, Carla, I'll give out the details at the end of the show.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.520
 Okay.

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:09.520
 But in case I forget, you can email me, Andrew, A-N-D-R-A-W, at westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.520
 Okay.

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:14.520
 And if you want to email me, just put in there, you know, I was the caller about temperature.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:19.520
 And I'll send you something that you can go fill out and we'll take a look at it.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.520
 Thank you so much.

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.520
 You're welcome.

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.520
 Okay.

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.520
 We have another caller on the air.

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.520
 Caller, where are you from?

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.520
 What's your question?

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.520
 I'm from New Jersey.

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.520
 Two questions.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:37.520
 On vegetables, you mentioned in a previous show that they provided a lot of calcium.

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:44.520
 When you eat cooked vegetables, whether it's root vegetables or greens, and you cook them,

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:47.320
 do you get rid of the PUFA?

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:54.120
 And also, do you have, in addition to PUFA, a phosphate to calcium ratio issue, depending

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.120
 on the type of vegetable?

00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:01.520
 Because I believe that maybe Andrew's wife had mentioned something about cooking vegetables

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.720
 in baking soda.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.560
 And for some reason that perhaps helped the phosphate ratio.

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.320
 I could be misremembering.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.040
 But that's question one.

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:21.120
 The second one on mushrooms, does that have the same effect as carrots and charcoal and

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.120
 pade arco?

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:25.160
 And if so, how is it different from those?

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.640
 So those are the two.

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.720
 What was the question about the mushrooms again?

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:37.840
 Well, that was the second question about is it really most targeted toward endotoxins

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.880
 similar to charcoal and the carrot salad?

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.080
 And if so, how does it work differently from those?

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:51.120
 Should it be a main staple of eating to replace or to trade off against using carrot salad

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.120
 or charcoal?

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:59.920
 Yeah, it has a good balance of all of the nutrients compared to carrots.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:06.200
 Cooked mushrooms have, in general, a fair balance of minerals.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:16.480
 They're somewhat low in calcium, but not as bad as grains and beans and meat.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:25.280
 And they have the fibrous effect that the carrot has of helping to sweep out the intestine

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.280
 just by the bulk effect.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:32.960
 Okay, and the first question was on the vegetables and the root vegetables.

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:38.240
 If you cook them in baking soda or water, but you add baking soda, does that somehow

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:41.560
 reduce the phosphate and reduce the PUFA?

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:48.560
 It makes the substance more digestible, so you get more protein out of it.

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:57.760
 But the greens do have too much PUFA to use them as your main food.

00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.760
 When the cows...

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.280
 Even if you cook them?

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:03.720
 Even if you cook them for 40 minutes or whatever?

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:13.280
 If you cook them for hours, much of the PUFA would float to the surface, and you could

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.480
 get some of it off that way.

00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:26.400
 But still, they're high in PUFA, and the cow's digestive system uses bacteria and vitamin

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:34.400
 E to eliminate 98% of the PUFA, so it's better to process greens through cows.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.400
 Drink the milk.

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.400
 Yeah.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:46.280
 The calcium-phosphorus ratio is the best thing about greens.

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:50.760
 They're extremely high in calcium relative to phosphate.

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.600
 Are root vegetables the same?

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.480
 Do you look at those differently?

00:53:55.480 --> 00:54:00.200
 You still have to cook those for an hour, and do they have benefit?

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.200
 Yeah.

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:09.720
 Turnips, for example, they have a fructose when they're in a young and fresh state and

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:16.280
 are relatively nutritious.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:17.280
 Just not a PUFA...

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.280
 No PUFA problem on those?

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.400
 The what?

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.680
 Much less of a PUFA problem in the roots than there are in the greens?

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.680
 Much less of a PUFA problem.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.680
 Okay.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:33.640
 I think we better hold it right there because it is just a couple of minutes to the top

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:36.240
 of the hour where we're going to be ending the show.

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.520
 So thank you so much for all the callers that have called in.

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:44.280
 Dr. Peat, once again, thank you so much during this year, as well as all the others, for

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:50.200
 just giving your time and making yourself available and leaving a lasting testimony,

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:56.840
 both on the internet as well as currently with people further researching what you're

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:57.840
 talking about.

00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:58.840
 Okay.

00:54:58.840 --> 00:54:59.840
 Thank you.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:00.840
 Okay.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:01.840
 Thanks again.

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:02.840
 Okay.

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:04.920
 So for people who have listened to the show and are interested to find out more about

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:11.160
 what we've discussed, what Dr. Peat's perspective on skin cancers is in relation to Tullio

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:21.480
 Simoncini, his work with iodine and bicarbonate is an anti-cancer treatment, as well as Dr.

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:28.120
 Peat's perspective on cancers and health-related topics of which most people may be getting

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.560
 the wrong information, visit his website.

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.560
 It's www.rayPeat.com.

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:42.640
 He's got a lot of fully referenced articles that you can download.

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:47.120
 You can read everything that he's published so far, which is pretty voluminous.

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:52.520
 And you could, I believe he's still answering emails, although I know he is so swamped and

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:56.420
 has gotten so busy, but I think he does his best to answer those.

00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:01.360
 And he has a newsletter also, which I know a lot of people have subscribed to over the

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.360
 last decades.

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:08.240
 But anyway, for those people who have listened to the show and have enjoyed what we have

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:15.200
 to talk about and or anything else, we can be reached Monday through Friday at 1-800-1888.

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:21.200
 Sorry, it's not an 800 number, it's 1-888-WBM-HERB or visit our website.

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:24.560
 It's westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:30.100
 I'm actually a medical herbalist from England and we produce extracts of medicinal herbs.

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:36.920
 And obviously we love alternatives to traditional, not traditional, the current therapies, which

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:42.240
 unfortunately a lot of which seem to be very untried and causing more problems than most

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.240
 cases.

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:49.200
 Anyway, thanks so much for listening and be back 3rd Friday of January 2019.

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.600
 Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
