00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Good evening. My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8 p.m.,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 or which are sourced from other U.S. certified organic suppliers.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic of "You are what you eat" or "absorb" for that matter.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923-3911, or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 and we can also be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBM-HERB for further questions during normal business hours Monday through Friday.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 So this month we are again very pleased and fortunate to welcome Dr. Ray Peat back to this show,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 and we'll be exploring how medical radiation can have deleterious effects on our living biological systems,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 and if time allows, a discussion of food safety in our world today.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 I wanted to remind our listeners of the Hippocratic Oath which is undertaken by doctors, and they begin their practice.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 And first and foremost in the Hippocratic Oath it states "First do no harm".

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 So this is the fundamental clause, if you like, of practicing medicine, "First do no harm".

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Okay, so I wanted to welcome Dr. Raymond Peat onto the show. Good evening, Dr. Peat.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Hello.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 And perhaps for some of our listeners who may have heard the intro and maybe not heard you before,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 I know a lot of people have heard you, but there's always some people who pick up a new thing and may not have heard of you before.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Will you just very briefly give the people that are listening an outline of your academic background?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 I was a student of literature and linguistics for years before I decided to get a degree in biology.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 And in 1968 I went to the University of Oregon intending to get a Ph.D. concentrating in neurology or brain biology.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 But very quickly I saw that the nerve and brain people were extremely dogmatic,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 not really interested in studying the way the organism works.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 And I found that reproductive physiology in that university had a really scientific orientation.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 And so I did my dissertation on the endocrine and metabolic changes in aging of the reproductive systems.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Okay. And also know that you're an expert if you would like to call yourself that, so far as thyroid hormones are concerned.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 And they've done a lot of work on thyroid hormone and progesterone and related hormones.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 I wanted to ask you to expand on a topic that perhaps many people that are listening to the show this evening have thought or suspected.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 And that is that x-radiation for those people that get in traffic accidents and have x-rays

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 or people that are just exploratory x-rays being subjected to them,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 probably would think to themselves about the negative effects or the potential harm of x-rays.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 But yet obviously the medical establishment purports them to be very safe

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 and there's no, I don't know if there's any real exposure upper limit to which you're not allowed to have any more x-rays.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 But I've never heard of anybody being told they can't have any more x-rays because they've had their quota.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 And they don't keep a record of how much radiation they're giving patients.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 I've had many people who had obvious brain symptoms or spinal column symptoms of radiation poisoning

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 and they asked the various doctors that had treated them what their exposure had been.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 For example, radiation for prostate cancer and fluoroscope visualization during heart surgery and so on.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 And none of the doctors had the vaguest idea how much radiation they had,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 but it added up and caused classical degenerative symptoms.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 And isn't it also true that there's not really an organization that monitors the x-ray machines in hospitals

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 as to how much radiation each machine is emitting?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 I think that has improved.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 They're supposed to calibrate them once a year I think generally.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Would you like to describe the principle behind the x-radiation

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 and how it can have negative effects in terms of the breakdown of the particles?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 The harmful effects of the radiant type of energy, which there's a spectrum ranging from radio waves through infrared and ultraviolet

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 and soft and hard x-rays and gamma rays and so on.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 The harmful effect is essentially from ionization of molecules in the body.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 And so they classify things from hard or C ultraviolet category through x-rays and gamma rays as ionizing radiation.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 But actually there are molecules in the body that ionize spontaneously.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 And so anything from the weakest energy can increase the degree of ionization in the body.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 And it's a very misleading idea that only the ionizing radiation so-called is harmful.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 But it's the amount of ionization that is produced that causes the damage.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 And the radiation has to interact and in effect has to resonate with some atom or molecule in the tissues to cause the harm.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 So that if it passes through without being absorbed, there's not any particular harm done.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 But if it ends up in your tissue and doesn't come out the other side, then that does the harm.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 So red light can pass through your body harmlessly.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Blue and ultraviolet light will give you a sunburn.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 And with soft, lower energy x-rays, you can get a sunburn on one side while you're barely exposing film on the other side of your body.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 So they've tended to use higher energy hard x-rays so that you don't fry one side of your body to get a picture of something inside.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 But still with any, like a chest x-ray, the side that's facing the emitter is going to get a higher dose than the other side.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 So that's showing that something is getting stuck in the body.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 It's not going all the way through.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 It's the same principle that you get sunburned on the side facing the sun.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 And you can see if you hold your hand up against the sun, you can see red coming through.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 But the side facing the sun is what gets sunburned.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 And so if you are facing the x-ray emitter with the detector on to your back, your breasts are going to be at greater risk than if you were turned the other way.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 But since your heart is right in the middle, your heart gets it either way and your lungs.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 OK, Howard, in terms of the exposure to the negative effects of radiation, how would you compare the sun's radiation and although the sun will provide vitamin D for us...

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 And red light.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Yeah, and red light.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 How do you see the damaging effects of the sun compared to radiation, for example, from MRIs or from...

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Well, the atmosphere filters out the harder, higher energy x-rays and ultraviolet C.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 And so the kind of ultraviolet that burns us is ultraviolet A and B.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 And to some extent, the blue light can cause a sunburn.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 And the slight burning effect is very superficial.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 It goes just a couple of millimeters or three into your skin and is absorbed.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 But the damage that it causes there, a sunburn can poison you systemically.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 So that even though it's all absorbed at the surface, you can suffer general systemic sickness from getting sunburned.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 And it's the same if you're burned with a hot iron.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 It'll make you sick all through your body because of material absorbed.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 And the things in your skin that absorb the radiation from ultraviolet are the first things are the colored vitamins, folic acid, vitamin B2 and carotene or vitamin A.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 And the polyunsaturated fatty acids spread the energy absorbed by these colored substances.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 And then the excited or oxidized fatty acids in your skin can travel and cause the release of inflammatory mediators all the way from your skin into your bloodstream and throughout your body.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 So even the superficial burn has systemic effects.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 But really, it's just the superficial injury that you get from sunlight.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Cosmic rays are particles moving at extremely high speed.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 Some of them go deeply into the earth, but they pass through our bodies constantly.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 A cloud chamber will create a mist.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 Every time a particle goes through, it leaves a trail.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 And so in a second, many particles will be passing through our bodies.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 These primary particles, the particles coming directly out of the cosmos, are traveling at such high speed that our particles, our molecules, don't resonate with them.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 And pretty much the electrons that are released go back to where they were knocked loose from and don't cause much damage.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 There is a little chronic damage from cosmic rays.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 But if you put animals under about a half an inch of lead, these cosmic primary rays hit a nucleus in the lead.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Instead of being shielded, they cause a fission reaction in the lead nucleus.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 And then there's an intense shower of secondary, they're called secondary cosmic rays.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 And if you're in a building with a very thick roof, especially with metal things over your head, you get some of that same effect that would be produced by a lead shielding over your head.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 So how did...

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 So cosmic rays, the higher you go, the less probability there is that a secondary radiation will be produced because the atmosphere is so thin.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 More of them will pass through harmlessly.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Because they're traveling faster?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Yeah, essentially they're traveling faster.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 And some of the particles that are produced in the secondary or tertiary reactions, those are lower energy particles.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 And many of them, you can follow the tracks they leave in a chemical substance just to see what happens to them.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 But they increase their ionization of the tissue as they slow down.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 And so it's like if you're skiing at high speed and you fall off your skis and hit the snow, you slow down.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 If it's very fluffy snow, you slow down gradually.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 If it's very dense snow, you come to a very sudden damaging stop and all the energy is absorbed by your tissue suddenly.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 That's what happens with these lower energy particles.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 And if you eat an isotope which emits particles, such as the radioactive isotopes they give you to scan your thyroid or to treat thyroid cancer or to do the PET scans,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 those emit isotopes which are largely absorbed right in the tissue in the local area.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 And so those are extremely carcinogenic.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 So not only are you exposed to the carcinogenic effect of the actual PET scan,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 but then the substance you take in order to show up on the PET scan is also radioactive.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Yeah, and they often do it to find a tumor that concentrates radioactive substance.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 But if you look at the whole body, the brightest spots are usually the brain, the kidneys and the thyroid gland.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 They don't mention that those are highly metabolic areas that release, metabolize, concentrate the radioactive substance.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 Wow. So you're talking about radiation in terms of sunshine, cosmic rays and these x-ray machines.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 So are you saying that a sunburn is essentially as bad as x-rays or?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 No, it's very bad for your skin, but it only has a little systemic lingering damage.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 But the body absorption when it's systemic, there's a great mass involved.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 So a fairly low intensity that goes through your body and produces reactions can leave a sort of inflammatory reaction that can linger.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 For example, in Japan, they have done blood tests that show that people who were exposed 60 years earlier to the atomic bomb

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 still have a lingering inflammatory reaction in which their blood is still emitting excited photons.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 So they still basically have radioactive particles inside their body?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 Well, not exactly radioactive, but it started a process sort of like rancidity in oil. If you want to start the process, then it continues.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 And if you start an inflammatory reaction with radiation and don't stop it somehow, it can continue for the rest of your life.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 It's just getting worse. So when doctors say or dentists say that, well, this one x-ray is just equivalent to spending all day in the sun.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 I mean, how untrue is that? Well, totally untrue, because the sun is it might stress you if you get really fried in the sun so that your skin blisters and peels off and so on.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 That can kill you if you do overdo it. But the ordinary sunburn is actually slightly good for you, probably by making vitamin D.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 But there's no good produced by the type of radiation from an x-ray.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 And what about all those people that work in buildings that are constantly like spending 12 hour days or eight to 12 hour days?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 Above the 25th parallel of latitude, the cosmic rays are intense enough that that probably increases your cancer risk.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 They used to believe that it was only the direct action of of an x-ray or gamma ray or isotope on your genetic material that caused cancer and mutations and so on.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 But if you irradiate cells in a dish and cause the mutations in those exposed dishes, but then you add fresh cells to the dish,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 the fresh cells which weren't exposed to radiation will begin to mutate.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 So it's like analogous to the starting the rancidity process in oil.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 It starts an inflammatory process in the exposed cells and they it's called the bystander effect.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 They spread the damage to the innocent, unexposed bystander cells.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 OK, so you had two dishes together. One dish is radioactive. The other one.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 Well, no, one dish you put under the x-ray and give it a dose that will cause those cells damage.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 OK, and then the dish next to it is completely untouched, has not been exposed.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 And then you mix the cells so that they can get near each other.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Wow. The damaged cells send the signal to the new cells in their environment that causes the same kind of damage to the new cells exactly as if they had been irradiated.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 Is this difference or this trait, is it heritable?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 Yeah. People are trying to identify the nature of the chemical signal.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 Some people think it's it's a photo photo electric or photo chemical reaction.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 And that's possible because the the inflammatory mediating chemicals do stimulate photo chemical reactions when they affect the cell.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 So it's undoubtedly a mixture of excitation and chemical signaling.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 In dentists will often put a lead apron over a person and say if a woman is pregnant,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 she will cover her abdomen with the lead apron and they were just going to x-ray your head. So the baby isn't affected.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 But there was a study in Seattle a few years ago in which they looked at a large group of people who got different amounts of x-rays to their mouth.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 And pregnant women who had a full set of dental x-rays when their babies were later born had been present under the lead apron.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 They were underdeveloped, a small further developmental stage showing that something had happened systemically to the mother's physiology that affected the nutrition and growth of the developing fetus.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 And this in animal experiments in the 1950s, this was already clearly established that x-rays act like estrogen.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 It will even cause rodents to go into heat to be x-rayed because it is so similar to estrogen.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 And for several years, people thought that was because it excited the pituitary to turn on the ovaries.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 But other experiments showed they would just x-ray the animal's foot and the ovaries or the whole physiology would behave as if they had been given estrogen.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Good grief.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Okay, well, for those of you listening, this is Ask Your Web Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's topic of medical irradiation.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 Our guest speaker is Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 He's a PhD in physiology and hormone chemistry.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 And the show is based on the supposition that x-rays and other medical radiation for examination purposes is safe is actually not true.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 I just wanted to perhaps, Dr. Peat, if you would, if you know any figures of quantification of damage that can be done to people or to cells

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 in measurable ways that maybe people will identify with perhaps.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 The studies looking at large populations see from animal studies, they see that the babies are underdeveloped

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 and their brains in particular grow more slowly.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 And in human studies, they can see that just a few rads or rems of radiation,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 like several times the background radiation intensity,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 that that's enough to increase some cancers of the brain and eyeball, for example, and thyroid.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 When they're just getting dental x-rays, the radiation bounces off the teeth and exposes the eyes, brain, and thyroid more than other parts of the body.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 But now that the bystander effect is known and the estrogenic effect,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 I think there will be more studies looking at the subsequent pregnancies of women who have been irradiated because of the lingering bystander effect.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 The fetuses are going to be basically estrogenized if the woman had a significant amount of radiation even before getting pregnant.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 So would it be worse or better to have the lead shield on the body?

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 In the case of x-rays, lead is very protective.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 But the trouble is that they don't protect your mouth and the mouth sends the estrogen-like signals all through the body.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 So the baby's damage was because of the radiation on the brain, the mother's brain,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 and her thyroid gland and eyeballs or whatever cells that touch there, and that then had a systemic effect on her child.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 Yeah.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 We have a caller.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 I think we have a caller, yeah.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 A caller, you're on the air?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 I am.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 Yeah, go ahead.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Hi, I had a question regarding microwave radiation.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 And as it's related to telephone and several other technologies,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 also if anything to do with cell phones would be damaging that Dr. Peat knows about.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 And I'll take my answer off the air.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 Okay.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 So did you get that question?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 It was sort of skipping.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 I couldn't hear.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 The caller asked if you knew anything about cell phone radiation.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 And she mentioned microwave radiation.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 So anything that you know about cell phone radiation that would be --?

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 Oh, well, yeah, I think the studies that are showing brain cancer from use of cell phones,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 way back 35 years ago or so, there were two or three laboratories or factories working with that frequency of energy.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 And there were clusters of brain cancers on the staff.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 Like within a year or two, there would be two or three people developing brain cancer,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 working around those very high-intensity fields.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 And in that context, the studies that suggest that the cell phones are causing brain tumors, I think it's very believable.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 How about the acoustic neuromas?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Because I know when the cell phones started becoming very popular maybe 10 years ago,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 there were people purporting to demonstrate acoustic neuromas.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 And so these are cancers associated with the ear?

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 Well, yeah.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 How do you --?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 All kinds of brain tumors.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Astrocytomas were the ones that they saw in the laboratory workers.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Okay.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 But whatever is close to a field is going to be affected.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 Because of the industrial commitments to exposing the population to high energy,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 everything from radar, airports, and microwaves around the downtown region,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 the government and industry have both put pressure on the researchers not to see any harm.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 But from the '50s on, several researchers were showing that nerves are seriously disturbed

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 even by very low levels of microwave and radio frequency.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 Are you at all familiar with the Bluetooth, the kind of wireless headset that most people now,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 because of the ban on driving and talking on your cell phone, are switching to?

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 Do you have any facts or any information about Bluetooth and how they might be?

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 No, I don't know what that is.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 Okay.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Okay.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 Yeah, I think there's another caller on the line, Dr. Peat.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 So, caller, you're on the air.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 Oh, hi, good evening.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 Well, the program is freaking me out.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 I need some dental work doing,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 because I realize that as soon as I go to the dentist, he's going to do a huge dental x-ray.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 What I'm listening to you telling me on the radio is that it's probably better for me to let my teeth rot

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 rather than have a dental x-ray.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 At least my brain will remain intact.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 I know dentists in Mexico who have gone against the pressure to do x-rays for everything,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 but I know endodontists who very reliably do root canals without x-ray.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 It can be done if the doctor is skilled enough.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 If the doctor is not primarily interested in getting the patient in and out and getting their money.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 Right.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 Right.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 So, it's not necessary to have an x-ray?

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 Well, almost never.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 You can probe if a dentist really believes that there might be a crack in the tooth that he can't see.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 Drilling a small hole to explore is--

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 Right, there are other ways.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 Right.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Yeah, and the Japanese in particular, but in other industries, ultrasound imagery has been proven to work beautifully for teeth.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 Right.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 You can see everything in a tooth with fine detail with microwaves, but dentists are invested in the x-ray technology.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 Well, great, thank you so much.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 I'm sorry we can't offer you the name of a dentist you can call who can help.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 Well, I feel so much better, thank you.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 Thank you, Fukuo.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, do you think that there are more and more--

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 well, maybe not more and more, but there are definitely some skilled physicians and/or dentists

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 who are switching to alternative techniques, perhaps in-- as you mentioned, Japan and maybe in Europe?

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 Yeah, they haven't really become commercial with these ultrasound or even MRI techniques,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 but they've been perfected scientifically, and it just needs an industry to grow up to displace the x-ray.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 Right.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 So MRI and ultrasound are radiation-free diagnostic investigative techniques?

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 Well, the kind of radiation they use is less harmful than the x-ray and MRIs.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Okay, there are several other callers dying to get on the air, Dr. Peat, so let's take the next caller.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 You're on the air?

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 Hello?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 Hello, you're on the air.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 Yeah, hi.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 I just wanted a quick comment on what you think of-- since anyone that flies these days gets exposed to some kind of scattering

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 from the x-raying of their luggage, I wonder if you'd comment on what kind of exposure levels they're getting from that.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 I'll take my answer off here.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 Thank you.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 Okay, thank you, Fukuo.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 Dr. Peat?

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 Yeah, I haven't seen the exposure doses from being near those machines,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 but if you look at the history of x-ray technologists in medical fields,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 the history isn't very encouraging for how careful they are.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 Dentists always assured patients that stuff was very harmless,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 but there was an epidemic of dentists losing their index finger to cancer,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 and now they make the patient hold the x-ray film.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 Wow, interesting, very interesting.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 Well, we've got two more callers on the line, Dr. Peat, so let's take the next caller.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 Caller, you're on the air?

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 Hello, thank you.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 There is a dentist a couple of hours south of here who does natural practices dentistry.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 I don't know the name right now.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 I could find out.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 I eventually want to go there, but it's sort of a dream to be able to afford to be able to do that,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 but I could find that out.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 What I was initially going to mention was that the new scanning at the airport,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 the one that shows basically your naked body, now that's radiation that you're getting from that,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 so it's something to consider, the cumulative effects.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 Also, you were talking about the inflammation,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 and although I have daily herbs and nutrition that would be very anti-inflammatory,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 the last time that I was checked, I have a lot of inflammation in lab tests

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 and also conditions that are inflammation conditions,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 and I had a lot of radiation when I was a child, both the liquid isotope kind of a thing that you swallow.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 I was a kid, so it was hard for me to understand,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 but I would lay on a table and have something pointed at me,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 and then everybody would hide in a little room.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 I had a lot of those treatments, and as a teenager,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 the doctor was really excited about the new mammogram machine,

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 so those had a lot of radiation initially,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 and there was really no reason to be giving that to a teenager.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 So I hope you're going to tell us some things we can do to help us counteract all of that,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 the cumulative effects.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 Okay, Dr. Peat, what tips do you have?

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 If you know you're going to be exposed,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 you can protect yourself in advance to some extent by making sure your thyroid function is good,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 maybe taking a supplement of magnesium.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 Magnesium is the single most protective substance against radiation damage.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 Vitamin E, vitamin A, all of the antioxidants are protective.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 Progesterone and some of the protective stabilizing hormones, pregnenolone, will reduce the inflammation.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 Probably coffee and vitamin E would be the simplest things to...

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Is that because of the antioxidants in coffee?

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Yes, caffeine itself has an anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 Okay, good.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 Would you know perhaps what the function of magnesium would be in that context?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 It helps to heal genetic breaks.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 DNA repair enzymes are activated by magnesium.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 And coffee is high in magnesium and other B vitamins.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 Okay, there's another caller waiting on the air.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 So, caller, you're on the air?

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 Yes.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 You're on the air, go ahead.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 Okay, I have a question.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 One of my questions was sort of just addressed, isotope scan I had for kidney stones about 40 years ago.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 And I'm trying to think with your lecture what can be done now.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 The same things that protect preemptively also help to repair the damage.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 One thing I didn't mention was niacinamide, which protects against DNA injury.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 So, do you want me to -- caller, I can repeat that list back that Dr. Peat listed as well.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 No, I wrote it down.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 Okay, good for you.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 But I did have another question.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 Go ahead.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 What about a full-body scan like a CAT scan where they have these full-body scans now?

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 A CAT scan typically gives you about 200 times the radiation dose that a single picture does.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 200 times, oh my gosh.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 Wow.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 And then people are getting them for their whole body?

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 Yeah, it's a big business, but --

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 Expensive.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 -- a very bad business.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 John Goffman, who died just a few years ago, discussed that in his newsletters and books.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 You can find a lot of his information on the Internet.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 John Goffman with one F.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 Oh, one F, okay.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 Okay, and then I also wanted to bring up one more thing, and that is I'm a midwife,

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 and I was going by several years ago a microwave tower out where I lived on 40 acres in the countryside.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 And I noticed that all around the microwave tower, every time I'd drive there, I'd see three-

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 and four-eared rabbits.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 What do you think of that?

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 Well, they've known for a long time that telephone or power line workers,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 that men have mostly female offspring and birds that live near power lines have nearly all female offspring.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 Wow.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 So it's increasing estrogen.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 Apparently, yeah.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 Reproductive disruption.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 Well, okay, I appreciate all your questions answered,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 and I just wanted to tell you that I've read your books and I love them.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 They're great.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 Thank you.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 Thank you for your call, listener.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 Okay, was there another caller on the line?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 Yeah, there is.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 Okay, so go ahead, caller.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 You're on the air.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 Yes, I actually wanted to add something to the list of things that are very effective at diminishing the effects of radiation,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 and it also actually contains many of the supplements you named, and that's seaweed.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 It's actually an amazing, amazing detoxer of heavy metals and radioactivity,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 so much to the effect that they believe the Japanese suffered less damages because of how much seaweed they had in their diet prior to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 Okay, Dr. Peate, what have you done?

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 Well, there have been advocates of distributing potassium iodide tablets to people who live around nuclear power reactors in case there's a leak of iodine,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 and seaweed is even better than potassium iodide tablets,

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 but it only protects you against radioactive iodine, which is the first and worst radiation injury from, for example, a three-mile island.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 A year after the leaks, there was an epidemic of babies born without thyroid glands.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 So you're saying it wouldn't help the radiation from a cat scan or an X-ray, but it would help from, like, a nuclear facility.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 Yes, it protects you against radioactive iodine, but iodine itself is slightly antioxidant,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 but it's also risky to use chronically because if you get just two or three times more than the minimum requirement,

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 it can increase the risk of goiter and thyroiditis and thyroid cancer over a long period of time.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 Interesting.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 Well, I just want to let everybody know that powdered seaweed in your diet is very helpful for the thyroid,

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 which, as you said, is great for reactivity and stuff like that.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 So thanks.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 Thanks for your talk.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 Okay, thanks for your talk.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 I think there's another caller. There isn't. Okay. All right.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 Well, let's get back to the medical establishment in terms of what I believe they would use as reasonable justification for these investigative techniques.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 What do you know that's happening that perhaps isn't being pushed commercially because of vested interests in existing techniques,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 but what are the upcoming, perhaps, techniques that are much safer for visualizing?

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 Well, for mammograms, for example, there is now good evidence that MRI and ultrasound will give you even better information than x-rays.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 Okay. Good.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 They just haven't been as developed commercially or industrially, correct?

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 Yeah.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 So basically, you're suggesting that under no circumstance would an x-ray be warranted,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 and perhaps an MRI and ultrasound would be even better.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 Yeah. I have avoided x-rays for, I guess, 15 or 20 years now.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 What would you -- okay.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 So I think the thing that is probably difficult to get over to people who are listening is that if they are, for example,

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 involved in a road traffic accident and they seem to have a broken limb or pelvis or something like that.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 I was actually involved in an accident a few years ago, and unfortunately, I think, because of the need for proof,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 I had to have a CAT scan on my head.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 I think it was completely unnecessary, by the way.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 There was absolutely nothing showing from it.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 But if somebody is involved in a road traffic accident and they may or may not have broken bones,

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 and the physician is obviously saying, "Well, we need to x-ray you, sir.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 We need to x-ray your chest or your arm or your leg."

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 Well, except for broken bones, if you have a splinter of a bone in your brain or lung or something,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 I guess it's a quick way to locate it.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 But you can't really see very much about the soft tissue with an x-ray, where ultrasound and MRI --

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 MRI was essentially invented to look at soft tissue and to chemically identify what it is.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 With an x-ray, you can't tell what is tumor and what isn't.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 But with an MRI, you can detect the type of chemicals, type of physiology in the soft tissue.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 So if you happen to be conscious during your accident and subsequent operation,

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 then you can request and deny x-rays and suggest that you want ultrasounds.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 But I guess after you sign that statement of informed consent, they basically do whatever they deem necessary.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 So I think it's a bit difficult.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 When someone's in the hospital, they practically don't have any choice except to get up and run.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 So what about when you want to fly?

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 I mean, can you tell the guy at the airport, "Oh, sorry, I don't do x-rays"?

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 Well, so far, that's optional, but they do the body scan.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 They take you into a separate booth if you're willing to do it.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 Otherwise, they have to search you by hand, I guess.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 Okay. So it does seem then that the x-rays and the other medical radiation is not harmless,

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 but there are vested interests in the financial side of it that are very slow to adopt new techniques.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 Okay. So I know it's about eight minutes to eight o'clock now.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 I don't think there's any other cause in the line.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 We were going to get into the food safety side of things.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 I know plenty of foods that have added ingredients that people would probably rather not recognize

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 for fear of having to do something about it.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 But I know the food industry is, again, very much corporate-driven,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:48.000
 and there are vested interests who would be much happier if you didn't know what was going on.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 Even people who read labels are not going to get all the information

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 because the FDA allows things that are known to be in the materials you make the food out of.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 They allow them to go into the food but not show up on the label.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
 Right. I was actually thinking as we were getting callers

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 and you were going over the subject in the early part of the show,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 what do you think, if nothing really changes in terms of what we're exposed to and/or increases the way it is,

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000
 what do you think is going to be the long-term effects of that?

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 I think it's already showing up.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 I'm getting really just a huge number of e-mails from young women all the way from teens into their 40s

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 who have a problem with fat around their waist.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 You can see it in the summer when they're wearing fewer clothes.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 You can see that teenage girls are getting fat around the middle.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 Obesity is epidemic and degenerative diseases, allergies and asthma are increasing tremendously

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 as well as the death rate from them.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 Just briefly explain the links between the allergies and obesity, fat deposition, etc.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 How that actually works?

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 Well, it hasn't entirely been clarified, but the things that cause obesity also cause inflammation.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 Asthma is an inflammatory disease and some people see obesity as in some ways an inflammatory condition.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 The cytokines that regulate metabolism, once you start down the inflammatory pathway,

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 you trigger cortisone production.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 Cortisone directs fat to your face and abdomen and shoulders.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:28.000
 Cortisone exposure increases and causes degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis and obesity and heart disease.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 The inflammation or allergic reaction is really prior to the chronic overproduction of cortisone.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 Okay, well I tell you what, there is another caller on the line, so let's get the caller on the air

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 and then that's probably going to be as much time as we have.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 So caller, you're on the air.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 Yes, good afternoon, good evening, rather.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 With all of this, what did he call it, back age or second stage radiation thing going on,

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 cumulative from all the x-rays and stuff you've taken in your life,

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:20.000
 have there been an increase in the number of cases of SEL, systemic erythematosus?

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 SLE you mean?

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 SLE, yeah, lupus.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 And is there any way to treat lupus successfully?

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 Yes, I've seen basically all of the lupus people that I've seen over the last 30 years with thyroid, progesterone

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 and avoiding the polyunsaturated fats, they all either recover completely

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:59.000
 or at least don't die of their kidney failure and so on.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 Has it been increasing over the years since we started even far back as the atmosphere testing that we did?

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 That's my impression, but I don't have the figures.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 Okay, thank you very much.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 Well, it is coming up for 7.58, so no more questions and we should probably wrap up the evening show.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:37.000
 I will say that there's definitely a subject that is coming up more and more and that is food ingredients.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000
 I know that the FDA are allowing manufacturers to exempt themselves, if you like,

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 from a certain percentage of ingredients on the labels

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 and that's how some ingredients can slip into foods without you even knowing it.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 But there are some very obvious food ingredients that have very negative health effects

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 and I believe that certainly warrants a program.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 So hopefully, Dr. Peat will join us for an expose of food ingredients,

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 some of which you may not even heard of, but which are pretty ubiquitous.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 So thank you very much for joining us again, Dr. Peat.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 Thank you.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 Okay, so for those who've listened to our show, thanks for listening

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 and we do appreciate your feedback and your calls.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000
 And until the third Friday of next month, have a very good night.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.100
 Have a very good night!
