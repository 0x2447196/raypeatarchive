 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 My name's Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows before, they run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8pm.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 We're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 or which are sourced from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Garberville 91.1 FM,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of this Friday's show at 8 o'clock,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of phosphate and calcium metabolism.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us, joining us on the show to share in his wisdom.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 The number if you live in the area for the call in is 923 3911,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 or if you live outside the area, the toll free number is 1-800-568-3723,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 and we can be reached toll free on 1-888-WBM-HERB for further questions during normal business hours Monday through Friday.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 So this is in fact the day before the first day of fall 2012,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 so tomorrow, September 22nd is the first day of fall, so we're coming into the autumnal equinox.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Alright, so Dr. Peat, thank you so much for joining us again.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Yeah, hi.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 As usual, there are people I'm sure who've just turned the radio on,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 perhaps have never heard your voice or don't know anything about you,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 so would you please just give us a rundown of your academic and professional career?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 I've been interested in nutrition for many years,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 and between 1968 and 1972, I studied biology at the University of Oregon,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 and concentrated on the chemistry and physiology of aging, especially the reproductive system,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 and that got me interested in many related processes.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Before I went to graduate school, I lived in Mexico

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 and was interested in the economics of nutrition and how to optimize good nutrition on minimum income,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 and I saw that the ancient Indian civilization had made some great technological advances in processing corn.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Corn normally has quite a few toxins in it,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 but they discovered that cooking it with lime, calcium hydroxide, made it more edible and less toxic,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 and so the traditional diet there was extremely rich in calcium,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 just as part of the tortilla and other processed corn.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 And that turns out to be something that's increasingly of interest to the biochemists of aging.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 In the last five or ten years, phosphate had sort of been ignored for about 100 years in biology

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 because it was sort of like water to a fish.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 It's always there, and the inorganic form of it is usually just considered as sort of the raw material

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 from which you activate proteins or form adenosine triphosphate, the energy-containing molecule and so on.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Recently, the inorganic phosphate in itself is turning out to be very central to all metabolic processes.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 So how are the South Americans making the lime?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 They were just mining limestone?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Yeah, you burn limestone and then soak it in water and cook your corn in basically almost pure calcium hydroxide,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 and that partly makes soap out of the fatty acids,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 and so it removes the toxic unsaturated fats which interfere with hormones,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 and it changes some of the amino acids.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Ordinary corn tends to have too much leucine, and that contributes to some of the toxic symptoms,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 but it's normally deficient in some of the vitamins,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 and it happens that the lime process converts tryptophan to niacin,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 and so it's like a niacin vitamin supplement,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 and that's why the nutrition diseases that occurred in the U.S.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 and in the southern states among people who lived largely on corn never occurred in the traditionally Indian cultures.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Because you've warned, I think it's the right kind of word,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 but against tryptophan as being a potentially harmful product.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Yeah, and the process of turning it to niacin happens to be very important in regulating phosphate,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 which otherwise would be one of the toxic features of any grain, cereals, beans, seeds of any sort,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 have a very high ratio of phosphorus to calcium,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 and so they're not only adding calcium, but they're giving a means for regulating your phosphate more perfectly,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 because niacin happens to be an antiphosphate nutrient.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Cool.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 So is there a recipe that they follow, or is it pretty much just like trial and error when they take dried corn and boil it with some lime?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Yeah, the recipe seems to be a big kettle full of corn and a big spoonful full of lime,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 and cook it until the shells pop off the corn,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 that little transparent husk loosens as the corn kernel swells up and becomes hominy.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 And so when it looks like hominy, you stir it a little to separate the cellulose husks,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 and traditionally they would let it stand in that liquid for a day,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 and that makes sure that the process is well.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 Would you be able to do the similar thing with fire ashes?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Yeah, that probably is better for some of the nutrients, and it makes a very delicious product.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Corunda is one of the tamale-like foods made with ashes instead of calcium.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Because I picked up on what you said about the fatty acids, and this is like saponification in soap making.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 You said that the fatty acids that are normally something that you'd want to keep down are actually esterified, I guess, by the process,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 and so that is similar to soap making?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Yeah, I don't know if they originally used the stuff for washing their clothes,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 but it is like a soapy solution that they pour off after the sanding.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Well, when I was visiting the mountains of Mexico and watching them make their different corn preparations,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 they used ashes for a certain type of product and lime for different types,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 and I couldn't quite understand which ones used which,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 but they were very specific that the ashes were only for certain types.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Yeah, they're both very delicious.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 They were all very delicious, all the many types.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Well, the main thrust of where we want to go with the topic this evening is I know that you've done a lot of research,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 and you said time and time again, aging as a kind of broad-based subject,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 and I think the feature of tonight's discussion about inorganic phosphate

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 and how prevalent it's become in today's commercial food industry,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 and we'll get into the reasons why in a bit, and the pathology that comes from it that we'll also get into,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 is pretty interesting because the aging process I think is inherently something that most people would like to try

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 and stave off as long as possible and stay as healthy as possible,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 because everything that we do, if we're not careful, contributes to degeneration and oxidation and the aging process.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 So can you talk a little bit about the age-related changes that occur with inorganic phosphate consumption

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 and where the bulk of people's inorganic phosphate is coming from?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Well, the main sources are meat and seeds, beans and nuts.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 Whole wheat, much more than refined white flour or white polished rice,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 those have the germ removed and the germ contains most of the phosphate.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 So it sounds funny to say that white rice and white bread have advantages, but nutritionally they do.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Because they also don't have the polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Yeah, and other toxins as well.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 But the vegetable source of calcium that has the least phosphate would be leaves.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 And so since cows naturally prefer to eat a lot of leaves, cow's milk has a very good ratio of calcium to phosphorus.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 So what kind of ratio, just talking about ratios for a minute, Dr. Peat,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 what kind of ratio would you be looking at as a good ratio?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Milk and cheese are about 1.3 to 1.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 1.3 to 1, okay.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 And human milk is much better. I think if cows weren't given grain supplements, their milk would have an even higher ratio.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 So do you think a cow that's grass fed producing milk is going to be producing milk with lower phosphate levels than a grain fed cow?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Yeah, I think so.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 And a lot of people habitually eat a ratio of roughly five, six, or seven times as much phosphate as calcium.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 We probably shouldn't exceed about two parts of phosphate for each calcium.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 And if you stick to a mostly milk and cheese standard diet for your proteins, you'll stay close to a one-to-one ratio.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 So we were talking earlier, Dr. Peat, about how many milligrams of calcium is in what you recommend for a daily amount of milk.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 Like if someone had three pints of milk a day, they'd get 2,000 milligrams of calcium.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 And the amount of phosphate, that would be the maximum amount they'd want to take in.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 In a quart, you get about 1,200, somewhere around 1,200, 1,250 of calcium and just under 1,000 of phosphate.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 So a quart and a half, you'd have around one and a half grams of phosphate.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 And so we were talking about how much meat would be the maximum amount you want to eat per day, or grains, or whole grains, or legumes, beans.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Probably something like half a pound would be tolerable.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 And if you wanted to put some eggs and cheese in there, then maybe a little less than half a pound.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 Yeah, you have to displace one phosphate source with the other.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 So this is, again, I want to make sure that listeners are aware that we're not anti-vegetarianism,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 neither are we pro-meat eating because they all have their benefits and their costs.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 So in terms of the phosphate load, meat, you said, are a fairly high source of phosphate.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Yeah, and the calcium in meat is very low. It's as high as 10 to 1 for phosphate over calcium.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 So would you like to just describe the kind of cellular aging effects of phosphate

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 and how we as consumers of phosphate, if we're not careful, can be harming ourselves?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 In the last few years, a strange mutant mouse was discovered.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 They named it Clotho for a Greek fate.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 And this mutant mouse aged very rapidly and had most of the features of human aging, such as decreased lung function,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 respiratory failure, hardening of the arteries, osteoporosis, wrinkling of the skin, all of the basic things that we think of as aging.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Calcification generally, deposition of calcium phosphate where it shouldn't be while taking it out of the bones where it should be.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 Right, okay, so that's the aging process in general you've just summarized.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 So excess dietary phosphate is one of the factors that is involved in aging of many different organs and disease processes.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 Yeah, and a lack of the nutrients such as niacin, which help to get it out of the body and keep it from being absorbed so freely.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Okay, there's an article that I was looking at earlier on that mentioned the link between lung cancer and an increased inorganic phosphate consumption.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 I'd say a little bit about the industrialized food production and the inorganic phosphate that's used in the production of foods and why.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Maybe a lot of people don't even know it.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Oh, I think it was probably in the 60s when they started finding that, I think it was because the government started regulating the adulteration of meat.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 They had been simply adding salt water in huge amounts. They started regulating how much water they could put in meat.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 They started defining the chemicals that could be used and it turned out that phosphate, various forms, polyphosphate and phosphate salts were effective for making meat hold more water.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 Once that was approved, it became very standard and so all of the things you buy in delicatessens are likely to be hydrated.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Ham now is, I think unless you have it specially made, it's going to be hydrated with something like 15% extra weight.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 So they charge for it as if it's all meat, which makes it much more profitable.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 And also, diapers underneath pieces of meat in grocery stores that have pre-cut pieces of meat for sale are usually very waterlogged.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 And they can give these chemicals to animals and cause them to have edema at the time they slaughter them and that counts as the starting weight and they can add 15% beyond that.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 So if you have very edema-less animals, your meat is even more profitable.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Because fresh meat that's just untreated and butchered up does not leak water. I mean you were mentioning, Dr. Pete, that it's hard to fry a steak anymore because you put it in the pan and it ends up being boiled steak and not fried.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 Yeah, in the 50s I liked to have fried ham with eggs for breakfast. But starting in the 60s I found that I couldn't get anything but boiled ham.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 I put it on the frying pan and it would just fill up the pan with water.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 So I guess unless it's like a prosciutto that's been dry cured, it's probably injected with a lot of water. That's probably why prosciutto is so expensive then.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Yeah, and this generally means that you're getting a tremendous extra amount of phosphate.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 So not only is meat already high in phosphate, then they add extra phosphate to it. So this is why they're noticing five to six times dietary intake of phosphate.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 So I guess with people eating either meat and eggs and dairy or meat and eggs and cheese and then whole grains and legumes, they're going to be getting phosphate.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 So let's talk a little bit about the best sources of calcium to balance this phosphate.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 In plant materials, leaves really are a great source of calcium because they, turnip greens for example, have about ten times as much calcium as phosphate.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Others not quite as much. But then you have to choose your leaves according to the toxins that you want to minimize. The cabbage family is antithyroid.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 And some leaves, well all leaves have a fairly high unsaturated fat content and that can interfere with protein digestion. So if you can process the leaves ideally, then you can get very good nutrition out of leaves, high protein and high calcium.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 Otherwise, milk and cheese are pretty much the alternative sources, unless you want to grind up egg shells and that's basically pure calcium carbonate.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Yeah, I also like to recommend nettle leaf steeped overnight because it has quite a lot of calcium. I think it's like a thousand milligrams per half cup of leaves that are soaked in a quart of water overnight.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 Yeah, if you boil any of these leaves, turnip leaves for example, you can just boil them quickly, get out most of the calcium and then throw away the leaf and have a good supplement.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 And I know you've mentioned that baking soda added to chard and spinach helps to block the oxalic acid and to release the minerals from the cellulose fibers.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 Yeah, and it happens that baking soda has some of the same benefits that niacinamide has. It helps your body to excrete phosphate more easily.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 And anything that helps your body make carbon dioxide helps to excrete phosphate. And salt and calcium happen to stimulate the production of carbon dioxide.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 And so foods that are high in calcium and moderate in sodium will help to get rid of any excess phosphate.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Okay, well you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor. From 7.30 until 8 o'clock at the end of the show, people are welcome to call in with any questions.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us on the show tonight. The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911 or if you live outside the area, the toll free number is 1800 KMUD RAD.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 Okay, so I just wanted to continue this with talking about the link between calcification which can occur in the vessels or in the tissues and the kind of rigidity that people get in the vessels as a result of calcified arterioles, etc.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 And kidney disease that can come about as a result of phosphate overload or the burden on the kidneys with phosphate consumption.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 So Dr. Peat, what do you have to say about people that want to try and do something about eating better and maintaining a more healthy ratio of their phosphate to calcium intake?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Lots of doctors for years have recommended cutting down on your calcium intake to avoid calcification, but actually that's the same sort of reasoning that they know that calcium excites cells and so they say cut down calcium if you have seizures or high blood pressure or whatever.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 But it turns out that that's a whole aspect of calcium that has been neglected.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 If you are deficient in calcium, you tend to get cramps, might have seizures, bronchial spasms and asthma. The lack of calcium excites tissues, turns on the excitotoxic mediators, triggers inflammation and sets up the conditions for depositing calcium.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 So when you're low in calcium in your diet, you're setting up conditions, increasing the parathyroid hormone for example, to take calcium out of your bones, make up for what you're not eating.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 And the parathyroid hormone releases serotonin among other things and histamine causing more inflammation, more calcification of the tissues, more tendency for the calcium to combine with phosphate and settle into the arteries, kidneys, brain cells, everywhere except the bones.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 So a calcium deficient diet is really associated with a lot of different inflammation and the stimulation of a lot of inflammatory mediators.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 Yeah, and in fact, the tone of the small arteries is very responsive to calcium. So if you're low in calcium, your blood pressure goes up.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 And for about 30 years, David McKerrin has been saying it's not sodium that causes high blood pressure, it's calcium deficiency.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 Deficiency, right.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 And so eating extra calcium can often cure hypertension or avoiding excess phosphate in the diet or a good ratio.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 For example, one of the things that started getting me interested in phosphate was looking at the fat-free diet that George Burr and the group did in the 1930s. They believed that unsaturated fatty acids were nutritionally essential.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 So one of their group, William Brown, went on a six-month fat-free diet, whereas diet consisted of nothing but a total of 2,500 calories a day made up basically of sugar, syrup for several meals and for supper, fat-free cottage cheese with a small potato starch biscuit.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 Apple and half an orange.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 An apple and half an orange, okay.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 So basically, it was a sugar and milk diet.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 Wow.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 A gallon total of milk, some of it made into cottage cheese for his dinner.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 For six months?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 Yes, and he had chronically had lifelong migraine headaches every week. And at work, he experienced a normal amount of fatigue at the end of the day.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 And he had hypertension, 150 over 100 sometimes.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 And his cholesterol was 250 and he was about 10 pounds overweight.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 But a few months into the diet, the sugar and milk diet, his cholesterol had come down about 50 points.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 His weight stabilized about 10 pounds lower.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 His blood pressure came down to normal.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 And he never again had migraine headaches.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Wow.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Even after he started back on his normal...

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 He probably never went back to normal probably.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 And one of the things they kept talking about in the article was that surprisingly, at the end of the workday, he wasn't tired.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 So the fat-free diet was actually good for him.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 Yeah, but it was a high calcium diet essentially and with that ratio of 1.3 to 1 of calcium to phosphorus.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 And several years ago, a group at the Linus Pauling Institute wrote a review of the importance of avoiding fructose, I think was their point.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 But they cited the study in which I think it was 10 or 11 men were put on a diet emphasizing sugar.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 I think they used decaffeinated Coke with high fructose corn syrup as the main carbohydrate.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 Every meal had a cola drink.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 And for some reason, knowing that human requires 400 milligrams of magnesium every day, they put these men on 165 milligrams.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 And they were wanting to prove that a fructose diet would cause derangement of the mineral metabolism.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 And in fact, it did.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 But in a very surprising way, on a magnesium deficient diet, these men went into a positive magnesium balance,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 meaning that some part of their body was retaining a little extra magnesium every day like they were growing.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 And also it retained a little extra calcium like they were growing.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 But the derangement caused by the phosphate was a slight loss of phosphate every day.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 It went into a negative phosphate balance.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 To do that, you can account for increasing calcium and magnesium while losing phosphate.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 I think only if they were turning over their bones.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 And a young bone is formed from carbon dioxide and calcium, calcium carbonate as the first bone,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 which is then replaced with phosphate during aging.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 So they were losing phosphate while gaining magnesium and calcium.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 I think that meant that they were building new bone.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Wow.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 And that was on a high fructose diet.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 Yeah.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 We do actually have a caller on the air, so let's take this first call, Dr. Peet.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Hello?

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 Yeah, you're on the air.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 Yes, I'm aging, and, of course, my biggest concern is arthritis, stiffness in the joints and in the back.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 And so I'm not too sure what kind of diet or what I've been doing that is not conducive,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 although I move around, and I do have some times I have days where I'm more fluid than other days.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Anyway, I was wondering whether a good doctor could give me some advice or whatever,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 and I'll take it off the phone.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 Okay, thanks, Tickle.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 Dr. Peet, did you get that?

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Yeah, reducing the phosphate intake or getting a good ratio, ideally not much over 2 to 1 in relation to calcium,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 I think is important, and that closely relates to thyroid.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 I think the polyunsaturated fats, which interfere with thyroid function and steroid function,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 they interfere with progesterone production, for example.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 They happen to also lower calcium in the blood, so when you're under stress,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 your calcium goes down and tends to deposit because specifically of the increased pre-fatty acids.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 So cutting down the unsaturated fats in the diet will help to improve your calcium ratio

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 and your thyroid function and other steroids, which are anti-inflammatory.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 So an equivalent of like three pints of milk a day would provide 2,000 milligrams of calcium

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 or a couple glasses of milk with some eggshell powder or oyster shell powder or boiled greens.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 Those are all good ways, but trying to get to about 2,000 milligrams of calcium would be a good start

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 for upping your calcium level and then keeping your whole grains and beans to not more than 8 ounces a day

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 or your meat not more than 8 ounces a day.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 So basically like 8 ounces of your protein source would be a good ratio for your calcium to phosphate.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 Another thing I wanted to mention is eggshell powder.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 If you take a quarter teaspoon three times a day, that's about 2,000 milligrams with your meals.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 Okay, so you're listening to Ask Herb Doctor on KMU-D/Gallaudet 91.1 FM.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 From now until 8 o'clock, callers are invited.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923-3911, or if you live outside the area,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 So we're pleased to be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat again with us this evening.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 So Dr. Peat, the recommendations have recently been coming out that phosphate be lowered as an additive in food

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 because it's a matter of concern and it's a potential health impact.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 Do you think industry is listening to that?

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 I think they all find some other way to make meat way more, some other way to get it to hold water.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 I'm afraid that one of those might be the gluey, such as carrageenan or gums.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 That's already in practice where they take waste fragments of meat or fish and add a jelly, such as carrageenan or alginate,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 and then glue the whole mess together with an enzyme that glues proteins together so it looks like a real lamb chop or squid patty or whatever.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 Right, these are kind of the reconstituted meats.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 Yeah.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 Okay, there is actually another caller on the air, so let's take this next caller, Dr. Peat.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 Hi, you're on the air?

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 Hello.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 Yeah, you're on the air.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 I had a question.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 I just started listening about 30 or 40 minutes ago, and you were talking about these sources being inorganic.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 So would organic whole wheat pasta or organic meats have less phosphate?

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 No, unless it's a matter of whether they have added it to one product and not to the other.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 But the way the animal is fed depends more on whether it has a lot of grass versus grains.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 The grains can be organic, but they're still very high in phosphate, and so the animal will be slightly poisoned by eating them.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 So grass-fed meat and milk from cows that are grass-fed will have a lower phosphate level than meat and milk from cows that are grain-fed,

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 because grains are very high in phosphate, so whole wheat pasta would be higher in phosphate than white pasta.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 Okay, I think when we mentioned it at the beginning of the show when that listener might have called in,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 I think there might have been some confusion between the inorganic phosphate that occurs in food and the naturally occurring phosphate.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 So I think that may have been part of the reason.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 The phosphate they add to waterlog the meat versus the phosphate that's naturally occurring in the grains and the meat itself.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 Okay.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 Great, thank you.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 In physiology, when you say that the organic phosphate is a protein with a phosphorus group on it or the ATP molecule or such,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 when that releases the phosphate, you call it inorganic just because it's not attached to another molecule.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 But we're constantly making our own inorganic phosphate molecules.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 Okay, all right.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 So to continue the discussion about the addition of phosphate to meats in order to bulk them up

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 and the link between phosphates and aging as decreased cell function, increased calcification.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 I know you've mentioned before in the past, Anna, we've had a couple of shows on calcium and how important calcium is

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 and the misnomer that increased calcium will cause calcification where it's actually the opposite.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 You said that it's possible to reverse the calcific aortic stenosis, say, or the arterial calcification.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 What commonly referred to hardening of arteries.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 Yeah, hardening of the arteries.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 Yeah, the Japanese have done studies using just vitamin K and very high doses of it,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 very effectively rebuild osteoporotic bones while taking calcium out of arteries in their animal studies.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 But vitamin K is working on cellular energy and specifically on the handling of carbon dioxide as a group that lets the proteins handle calcium.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 And things that increase your carbon dioxide work right along with vitamin K in helping to keep the calcium and phosphate in your bones rather than in your arteries.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 Even baking soda helps to build strong bones.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 And in the way it's acting, it's the same as vitamin K or niacinamide.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 It's helping the kidneys to excrete phosphate that you don't need,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 helping to deposit calcium and phosphate in the bones while taking it out of arteries.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 Okay. All right. You've also mentioned, I know, in the past the link between parathyroid hormone and calcium,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 how that calcium and phosphate metabolism should be treated by looking at any underlying hyperparathyroidism.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 Yeah, people who have good thyroid function and get enough calcium in their diet have a pretty low parathyroid hormone activity.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 Right.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 It's the low end of what's now considered the normal range.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 At the middle of the so-called normal range, people tend to suffer inflammatory diseases, muscle pains, bone loss, and so on.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 And the higher the parathyroid is, the more of these degenerative inflammatory diseases you have.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 And the first way to suppress that excess parathyroid is by eating enough calcium, but also vitamin D.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 That's the next most important thing.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 So if somebody doesn't get enough calcium in their diet or vitamin D from the sunshine or from a supplement,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 then they will be eating their bones.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 Yeah. In an experiment with animals 35 years ago, they put one group on a starchy diet,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 the other group with only sugar as the carbohydrate, and the vitamin D deficiency.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 And the ones on the regular starchy diet had very weak atrophied bones

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 because they weren't getting enough vitamin D to handle the calcium.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 But in that study, the sugar diet built strong bones despite the deficiency in vitamin D.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 And when you look at the experiment at the Linus Pauling Institute or the William Brown experiment,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 sugar was lowering phosphate.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 And apparently that accounted for the sugar making up for a vitamin D deficiency.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 It helps to handle calcium properly by helping to avoid excess phosphate.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 Do you think any of this can be an energy-driven process from the sugar being directly a fuel to cellular respiration?

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 Yeah. It shifts, as they saw in William Brown's study.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 The high sugar diet with calcium increased his production of carbon dioxide.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 When he started the experiment, his metabolic rate was 10 or 12 percent below normal.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 When he got on that diet, it came up almost to normal.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 And his production of carbon dioxide, a respiratory quotient, was higher than it had ever been.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 And this would be measured by his basal body temperature, right?

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 That would be a good way for people to assess their own metabolic rate.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 Yeah, that's the quickest way to look at it.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 And also monitoring their carbon dioxide on blood tests.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 And the other thing we were talking about earlier today, Dr. Wheat, was the phosphorus in the blood,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 or the phosphate in the blood.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 And there are some comprehensive metabolic panels that include phosphate in the blood.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 And there's a range of like 2.5 to 4.5 milligrams per deciliter.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 And you were suggesting it's better if it's between 2 and 3.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 Yeah, William Brown's was 4 when he started and came down to 2.7 to 3, I think it was.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 So that's another way people can monitor the phosphate levels in their blood.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 So in the wintertime, do you suggest that people eat more sugars because of the decreasing daylight hours

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 and the decreased vitamin D exposure?

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 I think, you know, it helps to activate the thyroid too.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 Your liver needs sugar to convert thyroxine into the active T3 hormone.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 And I think people tend to crave sweets more in the winter, which is an adaptive instinct.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 Okay, I think we have a caller.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 Hello?

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 Oh, hi.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 I'm curious.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 I have low thyroid function and I have a low body temperature, like down in 97.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 And I'm curious if that is what you are talking about, if you have any suggestions for that.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 Yeah, it's very much so.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 And I'll get off the air, okay?

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 Okay.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 Thank you.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 Sometimes if you have eaten things that suppress your thyroid,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 sometimes just a deficiency of protein can create a low thyroid state.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 But usually polyunsaturated fats or too much of the cabbage family vegetables,

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 too many beans and grains, all these have some antithyroid agents.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 Changing your diet away from those towards the fruit and milk and cheese categories,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 the saturated fats don't have these toxic antithyroid effects.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 So butter and coconut oil can actually help to increase your metabolic rate and thyroid

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 while reducing inflammation.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 Isn't it only one teaspoon of these polyunsaturated fats a day

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 that starts suppressing the immune system and the thyroid?

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 Yeah, they've looked at various animal studies to see where the influence of polyunsaturated fats

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 in increasing the cancer mortality, where it starts.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 And it's with four grams a day for the average human body weight.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 Which is one teaspoon.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 Yeah.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 So even the saturated fat foods like milk and coconut oil, cheese and butter and so on,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 about 2% of those fats are unsaturated.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 So even when you're avoiding the cooking oils and mayonnaise and so on,

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 you're still getting two or three grams a day of the PUFA unavoidably.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 And the other sources are if anybody ever ate fried food out in a restaurant

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 or you didn't cook it at home with your own coconut oil,

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 you have a lot more than one teaspoon in a serving of fried food.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:23.000
 Yeah, and the cancer mortality increases more or less in proportion to the amount of PUFA in the diet.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 So polyunsaturated fats include fish oil, hemp seed oil, flax seed oil,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 Canola.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 Sunflower, soy, cotton seed.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 Okay, there is another caller on the air, so let's take this next caller.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 Corn oil too.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 Hello.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 Yeah, we had a question regarding hardening of the arteries.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 You said something about vitamin K and also baking soda works similarly.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 Do you suggest taking that for hardening of the arteries and how much would you take?

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 Well, vitamin K, you can get a high-potency formula of a mixture of K1 and K2.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 And with that, I think from one to ten milligrams per day is up in the safe range

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 as well as probably being therapeutic for the bones and arteries.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 And what about, where would you get vitamin K?

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 And if you can't get it, can you use baking soda instead?

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 Well, liver and kale are the famously rich sources.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 I take liver once or twice a month at least.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 And kale is a good source.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 But I've known people who regularly take one or two teaspoons of baking soda with meals or after meals.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 They notice that it increases their endurance and energy, prevents fatigue and so on.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 Interesting.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 I use it myself for heartburn.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
 It works incredibly well instantaneously.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 They've tested it on athletes.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 And as much as a tablespoon at the start of a race can really improve their endurance and performance.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 But, oh, wow, I think usually the amount you take for stomach acidity is a good amount.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:45.000
 Vitamin K, you can buy that online, a brand that's pretty pure and it's in a clean oil source.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 Thorne Research Vitamin K Liquid.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 And one drop is one milligram.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 So we're talking about one drop a day of this stuff.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 It's pretty potent.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 You say one drop a day?

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 Yeah, one drop a day was, Dr. Heat recommended one to 15 drops of pure vitamin K.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 Okay.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 Very good.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 Thank you.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 Okay, very good.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 Okay, so let's quickly go back to vitamin D.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 Just because as we are falling into the autumn solstice tomorrow and the daylight hours will be decreasing here at some point,

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 and we'll be getting some rain and cloud cover, then the vitamin D, many, many different processes are supported by adequate vitamin D exposure.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 And we've talked about vitamin D in relation to calcification and how vitamin D can offset calcification

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 or correct calcium deposition in the wrong place rather than putting it down in the bones.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 One of the things that is currently being studied is the so-called activated vitamin D1,25-hydroxycholecalciferol,

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 which is the kind that you make when you're deficient in calcium or vitamin D.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 And it seems to have bad effects.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 And the anti-aging protein, clotho, suppresses the formation of that activated stuff.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 So taking a vitamin D and calcium are having a similar effect as that anti-aging protein.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 Clotho, cool.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 All right.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 So this was clotho, just a little -- because I don't know how many people will recognize the name.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 I must admit I didn't.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 It's only been discovered since '98, 1998, was it, as a Japanese --

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 Sometime like that.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000
 Yeah.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 And it's an agonist, right?

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 Sorry.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 Clotho, it's a beta-glucuronidase, right?

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 Yeah.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 And no one really yet understands that, apparently, how it works.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 They just know some of the side effects.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 Right.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 But it's important as an anti-aging compound, then.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 Yeah.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 And they're doing experiments with mice, increasing the production of it, makes them live extra long.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 After you get, like, 30% longer to have an extra dose of that protein.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 But since you can do some of the same things with fructose, niacinamide, baking soda, and so on.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.000
 Well, let's talk about some good food sources of niacinamide.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:41.000
 Well, liver and milk, cheese, eggs, tortillas.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
 Coffee?

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 Oh, yeah, coffee.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 Dark roast coffee is a very good source of also magnesium, which works against phosphate with magnesium, with calcium.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 How many milligrams of niacinamide is in a cup of coffee?

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:16.000
 I figured that I was getting with the dark roast coffee, I could get close to 40 milligrams a day just from the coffee, drinking several cups.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000
 Okay.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 I don't think there's any more.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000
 Okay, fine.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 So, we've got about six minutes left to go here, so we should probably not take too many more calls.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 But, again, from the perspective of phosphate to calcium intake and the foods that are high in phosphate that people should probably take note of,

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 that they need adequate calcium if they're going to consume these kind of foods.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 And I said sometime during the show that it's not an anti-vegetarianism or an anti-meat-eating program,

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 but both of those things, the beans and the nuts, as well as the meats, are fairly high in phosphates.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 And so calcium, as much as it's been maligned as a problem for hardening of the arteries or that kind of thing,

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 it's really something that people need to make sure they consume more of.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 And, again, it's very agonistic with vitamin D.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 Whenever you eat the high phosphate foods like meat or nuts, if you are constantly having some sugar along with it,

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 fructose in the intestine increases the resistance of the intestine to taking up phosphate.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 So it's like a phosphate blocker in the intestine while a phosphate loss promoter in the kidneys.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 So good sugar sources are, of course, fruit, fresh, ripe, juicy fruit, honey, sugar.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000
 Milk has a good sugar.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 Lactose, those are all good sugars that have fructose in them, or lactose is very similar in action to fructose.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:07.000
 And it's sort of equivalent to protecting against the high iron content of meat by having some coffee at the same meal.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 But if you put sugar in the coffee, then you're protecting against the phosphate too.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 And protecting your adrenal glands from lowered blood sugar.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 Great. I love it.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 All of those things that they would have told you are bad for you are actually the things that are good for you.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.000
 So, obviously, the saturated fats, animal fats, very good for you.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 Calcium, lots of milk, very good for you.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 Cheese.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000
 I think our ancestors had it figured out how to make it from --

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 They definitely had it figured out.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 Thousands of years ago until now.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000
 And I think we can't reinvent the wheel with all of our modern day processed foods.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000
 We're just coming back to where we came from.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:52.000
 So I'm glad that there's research showing that phosphate adulteration, if you want to call it, in meats is actually showing itself to be a potential problem.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 As always, I think the industrialization or mechanization of our food industry turns up compounds that are cheap and no doubt make money.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 And that's why they're added.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 But not always good.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 So, anyway, thank you so much for your time, Dr. Pete.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000
 I'll let people know how to get hold of you.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 Okay. Thank you.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 Thank you for joining us.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
 Thanks for joining us again.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 Okay. So it's a couple of minutes to the top of the hour.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 Anyone, let's listen to the show.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 If you go to www.raypeat.com, look at the homepage then, you'll find a link to the articles.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 And the articles, there's probably about 50, I think, 50 or maybe 60 articles the last time I looked.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 And many of them, well, all of them are fully referenced, but many of them will be around the subjects of aging and things like we've talked about this evening with phosphate and aging and the anti-aging effects of some of the hormones we've mentioned, things like thyroid hormone.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 And we've talked about pregnenolone, progesterone, et cetera, in the past.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 But those things are kind of anti-aging.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 So his website has got a great source of reference material.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 He's a research endocrinologist, so he knows what he's talking about.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:15.000
 And, yeah, our phone number is 1-800-888-WBM-ERB.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.000
 We can be reached any time after the show, Monday through Friday.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 Sarah?

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 Thank you for listening.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
 We enjoyed the show.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 Thank you, Dr. Pete.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000
 Yeah. Thank you so much.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:39.000

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:46.000
