0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:06.780
 Today's going to be another exciting discussion, deep dive into nutrition, learning together,

0:00:06.780 --> 0:00:09.200
 just having a free flow conversation.

0:00:09.200 --> 0:00:12.940
 And I'm joined by two individuals who tell you it's going to be a little hard for me

0:00:12.940 --> 0:00:17.880
 to keep up, but I'm just going to try to catch a tiger by its tail and learn a little bit

0:00:17.880 --> 0:00:22.240
 and hopefully try to translate it to our audience because you guys go into the weeds and that's

0:00:22.240 --> 0:00:30.280
 good, we need that. And to do so, we have a discussion today on the topic of nutrition, particularly the issue of

0:00:30.280 --> 0:00:36.560
 seed oils, and we're joined by Brad Marshall of FireInABottle.net and Dr.

0:00:36.560 --> 0:00:42.000
 Ray Peet. You can visit Dr. Ray Peet's website, raypeet.com, and also join his

0:00:42.000 --> 0:00:47.480
 newsletter. So Brad and Dr. Pe Pete, thank you for joining us.

0:00:47.480 --> 0:00:48.480
 Well, thanks for having us.

0:00:48.480 --> 0:00:50.180
 I'm excited for the opportunity.

0:00:51.460 --> 0:00:52.920
 Very good.

0:00:52.920 --> 0:00:54.560
 Dr. Pete, I wanted to start with you,

0:00:54.560 --> 0:00:58.360
 just some open questions to kind of get us thinking,

0:00:59.200 --> 0:01:01.720
 what is the ideal diet for a child?

0:01:01.720 --> 0:01:04.280
 You know, when you're thinking about raising a child,

0:01:04.280 --> 0:01:09.520
 I know my audience is a lot of younger people in their 20s, 30s, maybe they're

0:01:09.520 --> 0:01:13.360
 starting a family and maybe they found this podcast because they're thinking

0:01:13.360 --> 0:01:18.120
 okay I just don't know where to go. Some people are telling it's all about this

0:01:18.120 --> 0:01:24.120
 or that, it's keto, it's plant-based, it's this or that and is there a

0:01:24.120 --> 0:01:28.760
 little shorthand guidance you might be able to have for our audience, Dr.

0:01:28.760 --> 0:01:33.680
 Pete, about what is the best ideal diet for raising and upbringing a young child into

0:01:33.680 --> 0:01:34.680
 the world?

0:01:34.680 --> 0:01:39.320
 Dr. Peter Wilkinson It depends on the age.

0:01:39.320 --> 0:01:47.040
 Milk is the ideal food until they're about a year old. At birth, because of the effects

0:01:47.040 --> 0:01:49.840
 of the different oxygen tension

0:01:49.840 --> 0:01:53.600
 and higher estrogen and so on,

0:01:53.600 --> 0:01:58.600
 at birth the baby is overloaded with iron.

0:01:59.120 --> 0:02:03.220
 And so milk is very low in iron

0:02:03.220 --> 0:02:08.600
 to allow the baby to grow into its iron.

0:02:08.600 --> 0:02:25.000
 And so the apparent iron deficiency of milk is just right. We don't want to listen to the experts that say

0:02:26.200 --> 0:02:31.200
 since plain simple milk is low in iron,

0:02:31.840 --> 0:02:34.300
 a baby needs supplements.

0:02:35.680 --> 0:02:40.680
 The high estrogen that increases during a woman's pregnancy

0:02:42.640 --> 0:02:45.000
 has a very powerful effect.

0:02:45.400 --> 0:02:49.680
 Even on borderline iron intake,

0:02:49.680 --> 0:02:53.280
 her body is going to load up on iron

0:02:53.280 --> 0:02:55.840
 under the effects of estrogen.

0:02:55.840 --> 0:03:00.840
 It becomes nine or 10 times as efficient as a man's body

0:03:02.000 --> 0:03:04.640
 at extracting iron from food.

0:03:05.000 --> 0:03:10.000
 as a man's body at extracting iron from food. And that guarantees that essentially all babies

0:03:10.000 --> 0:03:15.000
 are going to be born with an excess of iron.

0:03:15.000 --> 0:03:20.000
 And at about a year of age,

0:03:20.000 --> 0:03:25.000
 they will have grown into their overload on iron,

0:03:25.800 --> 0:03:29.320
 and so they can start eating a mixed diet

0:03:31.160 --> 0:03:34.120
 even before a year if it isn't

0:03:35.840 --> 0:03:38.920
 iron content food like meat.

0:03:41.600 --> 0:03:45.000
 The metabolic rate is extremely high in newborns,

0:03:50.320 --> 0:03:54.440
 partly or largely because of the absence

0:03:54.440 --> 0:03:59.320
 of polyunsaturated fats in their tissues.

0:03:59.320 --> 0:04:04.320
 By the common test of so-called essential fatty acids,

0:04:05.000 --> 0:04:07.200
 The common test of so-called essential fatty acids,

0:04:10.760 --> 0:04:11.640
 almost all babies are born deficient

0:04:14.360 --> 0:04:19.360
 in the so-called essential fatty acids, but in fact, that's ideal for metabolism and the brain.

0:04:20.280 --> 0:04:24.940
 As soon as a baby or an animal is born,

0:04:25.000 --> 0:04:25.840
 As soon as a baby or an animal is born,

0:04:29.860 --> 0:04:31.600
 the exposure, like a calf,

0:04:36.080 --> 0:04:37.040
 starts growth on milk

0:04:42.040 --> 0:04:44.080
 with a relatively low content of polyunsaturated fats.

0:04:48.680 --> 0:04:53.680
 As they mature and start eating other foods, their tissue starts loading up on PUFA.

0:04:53.960 --> 0:04:58.960
 Same happens in babies that are down on a mixed diet.

0:05:00.200 --> 0:05:03.740
 Their tissues progressively load up

0:05:03.740 --> 0:05:14.640
 on polyunsaturated fats and that increases, but the fats from

0:05:14.640 --> 0:05:21.000
 the environment are diluted gradually by the growth of the body.

0:05:21.000 --> 0:05:28.640
 So like the... And where are kids, where are children getting a lot of their PUFAs in the

0:05:28.640 --> 0:05:38.400
 environment, you're saying? Yeah, from foods other than milk. And so as they shift to more

0:05:39.920 --> 0:05:48.680
 environmental foods rather than milk, their PUFA content increases,

0:05:48.680 --> 0:05:53.080
 but as long as their body is increasing in volume,

0:05:53.080 --> 0:05:55.520
 that is a slow increase.

0:05:56.880 --> 0:06:00.680
 In the 20s, when growth slows down greatly,

0:06:01.720 --> 0:06:10.680
 the rate of accumulation of PUFA in the tissues accelerates.

0:06:10.680 --> 0:06:25.000
 So by middle age, people have a very high content of tissue PUFA and that increases into old age

0:06:25.020 --> 0:06:29.840
 and the degenerating demented brain

0:06:29.840 --> 0:06:34.840
 has a very high level of polyunsaturated esters

0:06:36.960 --> 0:06:41.960
 of cholesterol which lowers the free cholesterol

0:06:51.260 --> 0:06:56.740
 lowers the free cholesterol in the brain and so impairs all of the metabolic processes that free cholesterol should participate in.

0:06:56.740 --> 0:07:11.580
 And as that lifelong accumulation of PUFA continues, the metabolic rate is like a mirror image of the PUFA concentration.

0:07:11.580 --> 0:07:31.840
 Baby has a very high calorie consumption and CO2 production, heat production, but by middle and old age, the heat production and caloric requirements are much, much lower.

0:07:31.840 --> 0:07:40.920
 So you tend to get fat unless you sharply reduce your calorie intake after middle age.

0:07:40.920 --> 0:07:47.800
 So, if you're at that one-year-old stage and you said you're introducing mixed foods from

0:07:47.800 --> 0:07:55.960
 one to two to three to four, what are the best dietary principles to follow in the proper

0:07:55.960 --> 0:08:12.160
 nourishment of a child to very high in PUFA.

0:08:12.160 --> 0:08:22.080
 A few tropical nuts are safe as far as PUFA go.

0:08:22.080 --> 0:08:25.000
 Fatty fish are another source.

0:08:26.640 --> 0:08:31.640
 They talk about the fish fats as being needed in the brain

0:08:32.960 --> 0:08:37.960
 because the adult and old brain has such a high content

0:08:39.720 --> 0:08:43.120
 of what we think of as fish oils,

0:08:43.120 --> 0:08:48.160
 the N minus three highly unsaturated fatty acids,

0:08:49.800 --> 0:08:53.480
 but those are exactly corresponding

0:08:53.480 --> 0:08:57.560
 to the decreased cognitive ability

0:08:58.560 --> 0:09:00.640
 and decreased metabolic rate.

0:09:02.160 --> 0:09:04.760
 And so, even though they say

0:09:36.200 --> 0:09:42.260
 rate. And so even though they say the PUFA N-3 long chains are brain foods, they're exactly fat seeds and especially fish, cold water fish with a high fat content should be avoided. Should children be, should fruit or sugars, you know, table sugar or fruit, should that

0:09:42.260 --> 0:09:45.360
 be limited for children or should that basically be to whatever

0:09:45.360 --> 0:09:46.360
 the child desires?

0:09:46.360 --> 0:09:49.800
 Yeah, basically what they desire.

0:09:49.800 --> 0:10:14.320
 And traditionally oatmeal was one of the first things to introduce into a child's diet and that's not terribly high in PUFA but at least it's very high in carbohydrate.

0:10:14.320 --> 0:10:27.560
 And during gestation, the brain develops pretty much in proportion to the availability of fructose and glucose.

0:10:28.940 --> 0:10:33.940
 And the more you displace those by fats,

0:10:35.440 --> 0:10:39.400
 the more you tend to slow metabolism.

0:10:39.400 --> 0:10:44.400
 So all sorts of carbohydrate, if you take into account

0:10:50.200 --> 0:10:56.000
 their relative lack of PUFA, all of those are brain-activating foods, especially fruits.

0:10:56.000 --> 0:11:02.000
 So, is it, I mean, there's the common adage that people, parents are worried about their

0:11:02.000 --> 0:11:05.340
 kids eating too much candy, but if you've got,

0:11:05.340 --> 0:11:07.940
 I mean, is it okay for kids to eat candy a lot?

0:11:07.940 --> 0:11:09.900
 I mean, I know there's a lot of ingredients in there.

0:11:09.900 --> 0:11:12.480
 I mean, assuming you had, you know,

0:11:12.480 --> 0:11:15.100
 a candy with a good fat, you know,

0:11:15.100 --> 0:11:17.220
 and lots of sugar and table sugar added,

0:11:17.220 --> 0:11:19.660
 is that okay for kids to eat to their satiation

0:11:19.660 --> 0:11:21.220
 or is that not good?

0:11:21.220 --> 0:11:31.120
 Well, they should tend to eat it in batches, not keep it in their mouth a long time and

0:11:31.120 --> 0:11:39.600
 support cavities, but if you eat a lot of it and then rinse your mouth, that's fine.

0:11:39.600 --> 0:11:40.600
 Wow.

0:11:40.600 --> 0:11:41.600
 That's interesting.

0:11:41.600 --> 0:11:50.800
 So it's reallyâ€”that's something that I think is very interesting for folks who there's there's a lot of you know conventional

0:11:50.800 --> 0:11:54.200
 wisdom that would say you know you're one of the essential things you've got

0:11:54.200 --> 0:11:57.920
 to do if you want to be nutritionally conscious for your children young

0:11:57.920 --> 0:12:07.720
 children is to limit their access to you know table sugar type foods and candies and things like that. Yeah. That, that pretty much grew up, uh,

0:12:07.880 --> 0:12:12.160
 along with the cholesterol myth, uh,

0:12:12.640 --> 0:12:14.480
 in the early 1950s,

0:12:14.960 --> 0:12:19.240
 the seed oil industry was seriously

0:12:19.240 --> 0:12:23.960
 damaged by the petroleum chemists who

0:12:23.960 --> 0:12:28.600
 learned how to make paint and plastics out of petroleum

0:12:28.600 --> 0:12:38.360
 and so they didn't need the seed oils. And so instead of using the polyunsaturated seed

0:12:38.360 --> 0:12:50.360
 oils for paint and varnish, they decided to sell them as human food and pig food, for example, because

0:12:50.360 --> 0:13:11.720
 they found that high-proof soybeans and corn were ideal for fattening pigs cheaply for market because of the cheapness of producing weight as fat

0:13:11.720 --> 0:13:14.360
 and general growth.

0:13:14.360 --> 0:13:31.640
 But the nutritionists working on how to fatten a pig took the same information. The rate of growth was the center of what a nutrition is supposed

0:13:31.640 --> 0:13:48.240
 to do. A vitamin that makes you put on weight faster was evaluated. You would give an extract of food and if it made you grow faster, then they would look

0:13:48.240 --> 0:13:54.200
 for which component it was and identify that as a vitamin.

0:13:54.200 --> 0:14:07.400
 But that blurring between fattening pigs and feeding people caused lots of problems.

0:14:07.400 --> 0:14:12.400
 But the seed oil industry, to convince people

0:14:13.720 --> 0:14:17.720
 that they weren't going to just get fat like pigs,

0:14:17.720 --> 0:14:21.960
 that there had to be a reason to make people

0:14:21.960 --> 0:14:32.880
 eat the paint stock, the previous seed oils that had been used industrially.

0:14:32.880 --> 0:14:54.800
 And to do that, they resurrected the work of the Burrs from 1929 and 30 claiming that the pufa are essential nutrients. That was

0:14:54.800 --> 0:15:07.760
 multiply debunked all through the 30s and 40s. There was nothing left of the Burr's claims.

0:15:07.760 --> 0:15:18.640
 But the seed oil industry brought back supporters of that doctrine and said they simply ignored

0:15:18.640 --> 0:15:25.000
 the disproofs of George Burr's experiments and said,

0:15:26.000 --> 0:15:30.400
 if the polyunsaturated are essential nutrients,

0:15:30.400 --> 0:15:32.300
 then the more you eat, the better.

0:15:34.320 --> 0:15:39.320
 And so they looked for a reason for getting people

0:15:39.800 --> 0:15:43.840
 to eat larger amounts of polyunsaturated fats

0:15:43.840 --> 0:15:48.680
 that wouldn't do if they would eat a gram a day,

0:15:48.680 --> 0:15:53.680
 which would be implied by the BIRS research,

0:15:54.360 --> 0:15:56.360
 even though that was wrong.

0:15:58.320 --> 0:16:00.560
 Wouldn't do the industry any good

0:16:00.560 --> 0:16:04.480
 if people met their nutritional needs

0:16:04.480 --> 0:16:07.560
 with just one gram a day.

0:16:07.560 --> 0:16:16.560
 So they said the more you eat the better because, and then they connected it to the fact that

0:16:16.560 --> 0:16:33.000
 these toxic oils lower your cholesterol and they resurrected some other failed research claiming that cholesterol caused heart disease.

0:16:33.000 --> 0:16:45.000
 It had clearly been established in the 1930s that things that cause heart disease

0:16:45.220 --> 0:16:50.220
 cause you to defensively make more cholesterol protectively.

0:16:54.140 --> 0:16:57.480
 Things like polyunsaturated fats

0:16:57.480 --> 0:17:01.180
 that inhibit your thyroid function.

0:17:02.260 --> 0:17:09.600
 Your metabolic rate goes down as you eat the PUFA, partly because your

0:17:09.600 --> 0:17:17.520
 thyroid hormone simply isn't available as it should be.

0:17:17.520 --> 0:17:25.000
 And so, eating the seed oils lowers your thyroid function,

0:17:28.000 --> 0:17:31.400
 and the thyroid function lowering the metabolic rate

0:17:34.380 --> 0:17:39.380
 requires a defensive adaptation to raise the cholesterol,

0:17:41.540 --> 0:17:43.560
 but it's the low thyroid

0:17:49.320 --> 0:18:12.740
 and the elevated polyunsaturated fats that are damaging the blood vessels, to produce the defensive systems against heart disease

0:18:12.740 --> 0:18:19.520
 increase cholesterol so you can make more defensive hormones

0:18:19.520 --> 0:18:24.960
 and compensate to bring up your metabolic rate.

0:18:24.960 --> 0:18:25.000
 And so they got the situation exactly backwards. to bring up your metabolic rate.

0:18:29.200 --> 0:18:33.200
 And so they got the situation exactly backwards. The PUFA do lower cholesterol,

0:18:33.200 --> 0:18:38.200
 but they do it by creating a heart disease

0:18:39.640 --> 0:18:41.900
 supporting condition.

0:18:43.220 --> 0:18:56.240
 And that shift to fear cholesterol, then a professor Yudkin wrote a book saying

0:18:56.240 --> 0:19:05.000
 it isn't saturated fats that cause cholesterol to rise, it's sugar.

0:19:05.280 --> 0:19:10.280
 And in fact, sugar is part of the defensive system

0:19:11.120 --> 0:19:15.160
 that helps you overcome the suppressive

0:19:15.160 --> 0:19:17.840
 metabolic effect of the PUFA.

0:19:17.840 --> 0:19:22.840
 The sugar helps to restore your cholesterol system,

0:19:23.040 --> 0:19:27.580
 your active pro-respiratory DHEA,

0:19:29.480 --> 0:19:31.980
 pregnenolone and progesterone,

0:19:33.040 --> 0:19:37.120
 and it protects the cells, prevent heart disease.

0:19:37.120 --> 0:19:41.960
 So the fear of saturated fats

0:19:42.800 --> 0:19:45.000
 because they simply are not PUFA,

0:19:47.200 --> 0:19:48.660
 which they wanted to sell.

0:19:49.680 --> 0:19:54.680
 That extended to the sugars

0:19:54.880 --> 0:19:57.240
 which support the saturated fats

0:19:58.560 --> 0:20:01.860
 and oppose, protect against the PUFA.

0:20:02.920 --> 0:20:16.080
 And so the teaching parents to starve their kids for sugar came about right after the phony

0:20:16.080 --> 0:20:18.120
 cholesterol theory of heart disease.

0:20:18.120 --> 0:20:19.120
 Right.

0:20:19.120 --> 0:20:24.020
 So there's a lot of confusing paradigms on top of each other where we stand today from

0:20:24.020 --> 0:20:25.760
 your position.

0:20:31.120 --> 0:20:35.680
 Why is it that if sugar rots your teeth and rots your face out, why would it be healthy though? You know, you said you got to swallow quickly and wash your mouth out. I mean,

0:20:35.680 --> 0:20:39.680
 is that really something we should be eating at that level if it rots your face?

0:20:54.600 --> 0:21:05.000
 The problem with cavities is that other things in our metabolism, things that suppress thyroid, such as PUFA, change the composition of our saliva and the saliva should be very antiseptic.

0:21:06.340 --> 0:21:11.340
 And with the overall pattern of the diet,

0:21:11.960 --> 0:21:16.960
 our saliva has lost the antiseptic quality

0:21:17.800 --> 0:21:21.400
 that kills mouth bacteria.

0:21:21.400 --> 0:21:27.500
 So does that mean, and maybe'm, maybe I'm over assuming here, but does that

0:21:27.500 --> 0:21:33.380
 mean that if a child was not introduced to these high PUFA foods, they avoided the fatty

0:21:33.380 --> 0:21:41.380
 fish, they avoided the seed oils, they avoid the nuts with these high PUFA foods, does

0:21:41.380 --> 0:21:45.840
 that mean that if they were to eat a high carbohydrate diet, high table sugar even,

0:21:45.840 --> 0:21:48.640
 that there would be less likelihood of cavities coming or no?

0:21:48.640 --> 0:21:54.640
 Dr. John O'Connor Well, tropical people very generally eat a

0:21:54.640 --> 0:22:10.000
 high carbohydrate diet and very generally, if they're on their traditional diet have extremely good teeth, but when they shift to a diet such as beans

0:22:10.000 --> 0:22:21.920
 and tortillas, nutritionally deficient and higher in PUFA from the beans, then the problem

0:22:21.920 --> 0:22:27.500
 of tooth decay becomes horrible. So it's nutritional deficiency plus PUFA

0:22:27.500 --> 0:22:32.500
 that is the foundation for a high sugar diet

0:22:32.680 --> 0:22:35.100
 to cause cavities, is that what you're saying?

0:22:35.100 --> 0:22:35.940
 Yeah.

0:22:35.940 --> 0:22:36.780
 Okay.

0:22:36.780 --> 0:22:40.300
 And that works largely through the composition

0:22:40.300 --> 0:22:45.000
 of the saliva and its loss of antiseptic function.

0:22:48.000 --> 0:22:49.900
 So Brad, I wanna bring you in.

0:22:49.900 --> 0:22:50.820
 Any thoughts first?

0:22:50.820 --> 0:22:52.420
 I wanted to ask you about the kid diet thing,

0:22:52.420 --> 0:22:53.560
 but I wanna go back and just let,

0:22:53.560 --> 0:22:54.720
 is there anything you heard

0:22:54.720 --> 0:22:57.800
 that you wanna ask about or talk about?

0:22:57.800 --> 0:23:01.560
 Yeah, I mean, it's very interesting to hear,

0:23:02.620 --> 0:23:08.640
 you know, Dr. Peete's historical analysis of sort of

0:23:08.640 --> 0:23:16.480
 the early days of, you know, the vegetable oil industry. You know, I'm not

0:23:16.480 --> 0:23:21.680
 old enough to remember a lot of those things, and so that I think that's

0:23:21.680 --> 0:23:26.800
 really valuable insight, right, that Dr. Pete is bringing there is how did we

0:23:26.800 --> 0:23:33.840
 sort of, how did we get here, right? And I think that is a very interesting insight that at one

0:23:33.840 --> 0:23:39.760
 point, you know, vegetable oils were made into paint or linoleum, and then that's, they lost

0:23:39.760 --> 0:23:44.240
 that market, and that's when they said, hey, you know, let's, maybe we can sell this to people.

0:23:45.760 --> 0:23:52.680
 market and that's when they said, hey, you know, let's maybe we can sell this to people. So you know, that's a nice little anecdote and I'm sure that it's true, you know.

0:23:52.680 --> 0:24:05.000
 And so I think that's a very interesting and valuable part of this whole discussion. I'm not nearly the expert on child nutrition

0:24:06.120 --> 0:24:10.920
 that Dr. Pete probably is.

0:24:10.920 --> 0:24:12.780
 I don't have kids of my own,

0:24:12.780 --> 0:24:16.960
 and I tend to spend my time thinking more

0:24:16.960 --> 0:24:20.880
 about obese adults than I do about raising children,

0:24:20.880 --> 0:24:23.760
 although I've raised a lot of piglets.

0:24:23.760 --> 0:24:33.500
 But just, you are a pig farmer pig farmers you have some connection to the reason why i want to bring it up is because i think having a starting point with a tangible.

0:24:33.680 --> 0:24:35.640
 Issue that.

0:24:36.140 --> 0:24:43.440
 That you know where the rubber meets the road okay we're talking about theory it becomes okay how we gonna raise generation we have an obesity epidemic.

0:24:45.200 --> 0:24:45.920
 okay, how are we going to raise the generation? We have an obesity epidemic. And so I want to know,

0:24:50.560 --> 0:24:56.960
 it's like a whodunit mystery novel for me. Whodunit, where does this go? Is it the sugar? Is it the carbs? Is it the meat? Is it the puffas? Is it just seed oils? Or is Dr. Pete right that

0:24:56.960 --> 0:25:02.320
 the nuts and the high puffa fish needs to be avoided? I want to figure this out because we

0:25:02.320 --> 0:25:07.200
 have an obesity epidemic for children. And if we solve that, then we can kind of know

0:25:07.200 --> 0:25:09.360
 where we're building the next generation.

0:25:10.280 --> 0:25:12.760
 Right, I mean, here's what I will say is that,

0:25:12.760 --> 0:25:17.760
 so I'm also a student of, I like looking at cultures

0:25:19.320 --> 0:25:24.220
 around the world and I know that a lot of grain eating

0:25:24.220 --> 0:25:25.000
 cultures in particular,

0:25:25.640 --> 0:25:28.400
 especially like rice eating cultures in Asia,

0:25:28.400 --> 0:25:31.160
 or let's say the Mayans in Mexico

0:25:31.160 --> 0:25:32.800
 who eat primarily corn, right?

0:25:32.800 --> 0:25:35.680
 And so these are very grain-based cultures.

0:25:35.680 --> 0:25:38.440
 And if you look at, you know,

0:25:38.440 --> 0:25:41.160
 Dr. Pete was talking about metabolic rate.

0:25:41.160 --> 0:25:43.700
 If you look at these cultures

0:25:43.700 --> 0:25:45.000
 where they're feeding children

0:25:45.720 --> 0:25:49.640
 primarily relatively low PUFA grains,

0:25:50.600 --> 0:25:52.640
 they have very high metabolic rates,

0:25:52.640 --> 0:25:55.540
 just as Dr. Pete suggests.

0:25:55.540 --> 0:25:57.560
 In fact, the whole cultures

0:25:57.560 --> 0:25:59.280
 have very high metabolic rates, right?

0:25:59.280 --> 0:26:02.400
 And so if you look at time-

0:26:02.400 --> 0:26:03.720
 What are low PUFA grains?

0:26:03.720 --> 0:26:04.560
 What do you think?

0:26:04.560 --> 0:26:05.400
 Right? So most time, right? What are low PUFA grains? What do you think? Rice?

0:26:05.400 --> 0:26:06.860
 So most grains, right.

0:26:06.860 --> 0:26:09.580
 So most grains are very low in,

0:26:10.660 --> 0:26:12.420
 they're very low in fat overall.

0:26:12.420 --> 0:26:13.960
 A lot of the fat that is there is PUFA.

0:26:13.960 --> 0:26:16.980
 So like rice, so like if people eat white rice,

0:26:16.980 --> 0:26:20.780
 we're talking like that's a very low PUFA food

0:26:20.780 --> 0:26:23.820
 because most of the PUFA that there is

0:26:23.820 --> 0:26:26.640
 is in the bran of the rice,

0:26:26.640 --> 0:26:28.980
 and that gets removed when you make it into white rice.

0:26:28.980 --> 0:26:31.380
 And so rice is low in poofa to begin with,

0:26:31.380 --> 0:26:33.740
 but when you eat white rice, it's even lower.

0:26:33.740 --> 0:26:37.180
 It's like, it's 1%, or I think it's well under 1%

0:26:37.180 --> 0:26:39.180
 polyunsaturated fat by weight.

0:26:39.180 --> 0:26:42.180
 And so you're talking, it's very, very low.

0:26:42.180 --> 0:26:44.780
 And so like on my blog, I talk about this study

0:26:44.780 --> 0:26:48.640
 about Thai rice farmers, and they have just

0:26:48.640 --> 0:26:50.800
 through the roof metabolic rates.

0:26:50.800 --> 0:26:52.920
 Like the highest metabolic rate that I've seen

0:26:52.920 --> 0:26:55.020
 in any metabolic study in the world

0:26:55.020 --> 0:26:58.680
 is in female rice farmers in Thailand.

0:26:58.680 --> 0:26:59.600
 But the same thing is true.

0:26:59.600 --> 0:27:03.520
 Like they studied the Mayans in the 1930s,

0:27:03.520 --> 0:27:07.100
 and they showed that the Mayans in the 1930s, and they showed that the Mayans in the 1930s had

0:27:07.100 --> 0:27:12.060
 metabolic rates that were significantly elevated versus the metabolic rates of

0:27:12.060 --> 0:27:16.660
 Americans. And this is another case where, you know, 90% of their calories are

0:27:16.660 --> 0:27:21.860
 coming from corn, and corn has more PUFA than rice does, but still when you make

0:27:21.860 --> 0:27:26.360
 it into the masa, you remove theâ€”this is the, this is the refrajar,

0:27:26.360 --> 0:27:28.840
 this means rubbing, you remove the,

0:27:28.840 --> 0:27:31.340
 you soak the corn in an alkaline solution,

0:27:31.340 --> 0:27:36.060
 and then you remove the husks and the germ,

0:27:36.060 --> 0:27:37.480
 and that's where a lot of the oil is.

0:27:37.480 --> 0:27:40.280
 So the, when you eat the tortillas, it has,

0:27:41.320 --> 0:27:44.960
 the traditional processing methods of Mayans, right,

0:27:44.960 --> 0:27:47.080
 who are one of the earliest

0:27:47.080 --> 0:27:51.120
 people in the world to domesticate corn, like they remove a lot of the pufa in the natural

0:27:51.120 --> 0:27:53.360
 normal processing.

0:27:53.360 --> 0:27:57.240
 And so that's why I also sometimes people knee jerk say, well, all food processing is

0:27:57.240 --> 0:27:58.240
 bad.

0:27:58.240 --> 0:28:01.680
 And I'm like, well, no, I think traditional food processing is actually very smart in

0:28:01.680 --> 0:28:05.520
 what they do because people don't eat, you know, the mines didn't eat whole,

0:28:05.520 --> 0:28:06.900
 don't eat whole kernel corn, right?

0:28:06.900 --> 0:28:10.940
 They removed the germ first and that's where the oil is.

0:28:10.940 --> 0:28:12.680
 And so they make tortillas out of that.

0:28:12.680 --> 0:28:14.460
 And again, they had higher,

0:28:14.460 --> 0:28:17.860
 they had very high metabolic rates in the 1930s.

0:28:17.860 --> 0:28:19.480
 And I like the point you illustrate

0:28:19.480 --> 0:28:21.500
 about your research in Native Americans,

0:28:21.500 --> 0:28:23.260
 the West Coast and the East Coast,

0:28:23.260 --> 0:28:26.520
 both using methods to reduce PUFA, right, for their acorn oil?

0:28:26.520 --> 0:28:33.560
 Exactly. So, yeah, so East Coast and West Coast, we have first account narratives of

0:28:33.560 --> 0:28:36.200
 Native Americans on the East Coast and the West Coast, both removing acorn oil.

0:28:36.200 --> 0:28:37.200
 And what period of history is this?

0:28:37.200 --> 0:28:43.400
 Well, I mean, I don't know the exact dates of those, but this would have been 1700s,

0:28:43.400 --> 0:28:48.560
 or yeah, 1700s probably, both of those anecdotes.

0:28:48.560 --> 0:28:52.560
 In the 1930s, George Creil did studies

0:28:55.080 --> 0:28:59.120
 around the world of metabolic rates,

0:28:59.120 --> 0:29:04.120
 actually measuring oxygen consumption and CO2 production.

0:29:05.000 --> 0:29:05.040
 oxygen consumption and CO2 production.

0:29:10.040 --> 0:29:11.040
 And he found that the American culture

0:29:16.040 --> 0:29:16.200
 was outstanding in being far below

0:29:19.740 --> 0:29:24.740
 the traditional cultures in metabolic rate. Many of the so-called relatively undeveloped cultures

0:29:30.200 --> 0:29:31.200
 Many of the so-called relatively undeveloped cultures had a metabolic rate 50% higher than Americans.

0:29:31.200 --> 0:29:41.120
 In US medicine, that would be considered pathologically hypermetabolic.

0:29:41.120 --> 0:29:45.440
 That was a rate that went with good health traditionally.

0:29:45.440 --> 0:29:47.440
 What was his name?

0:29:47.440 --> 0:29:50.760
 George W. Krile, Sr.

0:29:50.760 --> 0:29:54.000
 Spell his last name.

0:29:54.000 --> 0:30:02.000
 He was a famous surgeon and physiologist from 1900 until his death.

0:30:02.000 --> 0:30:03.000
 Right.

0:30:03.000 --> 0:30:05.440
 No, I just want to make sure I have

0:30:05.440 --> 0:30:09.840
 his name right. Do you know the spelling of his last name?

0:30:09.840 --> 0:30:15.440
 CRILE. CRILE, okay.

0:30:15.940 --> 0:30:19.140
 No, I mean that sounds fascinating, but it's not, but

0:30:19.140 --> 0:30:23.860
 that is very much in line with

0:30:23.860 --> 0:30:25.000
 what we see.

0:30:25.440 --> 0:30:29.680
 And I've talked about a lot of my blog

0:30:29.680 --> 0:30:31.120
 about the history of metabolic rates.

0:30:31.120 --> 0:30:33.280
 And one of the things that I noticed

0:30:33.280 --> 0:30:38.280
 is in the metabolic community in the 1930s,

0:30:40.600 --> 0:30:42.420
 this kind of controversy broke out

0:30:42.420 --> 0:30:44.760
 because someone at a Southern school,

0:30:44.760 --> 0:30:45.920
 and I forget the first one,

0:30:47.280 --> 0:30:56.480
 studied young college women. And so these early metabolic rate studies had been done in the north,

0:30:56.480 --> 0:31:02.640
 primarily in the 19-teens, and the, you know, between 1910 and 1920. And they had come up with

0:31:02.640 --> 0:31:05.040
 a couple basic equations to predict your metabolic rate based on your height, weight, 1920, and they had come up with a couple basic equations

0:31:05.040 --> 0:31:07.440
 to predict your metabolic rate based on your height,

0:31:07.440 --> 0:31:09.880
 weight, gender, and age.

0:31:09.880 --> 0:31:11.960
 And so you put those four numbers into the,

0:31:11.960 --> 0:31:14.240
 you know, onto your notebook and you calculate it out

0:31:14.240 --> 0:31:16.960
 and that tells you what your metabolic rate should be.

0:31:16.960 --> 0:31:21.040
 And this was very accurate in people from Chicago,

0:31:21.040 --> 0:31:23.000
 in people from New York City,

0:31:23.000 --> 0:31:27.940
 and then somebody tried it in Oklahoma or in Florida

0:31:27.940 --> 0:31:35.040
 I can't remember exactly and they found that these young women young college-age women had a metabolic rate that was around

0:31:35.840 --> 0:31:41.840
 15% lower than these equations suggested that they should so they had this low metabolic rate and

0:31:42.560 --> 0:31:47.600
 This was repeated in Florida, Oklahoma, South Carolina,

0:31:49.520 --> 0:31:56.080
 and others. There was at least, I think, four different schools that tested these equations.

0:31:56.080 --> 0:32:02.480
 And they said, yes, every time it was like the New Orleans, the young women here have a metabolic

0:32:02.480 --> 0:32:06.080
 rate significantly below what the mainstream equations

0:32:06.080 --> 0:32:11.040
 would predict. And then someone in Connecticut redid the experiment again, and they said, nope,

0:32:11.040 --> 0:32:15.680
 the young women in Connecticut have a metabolic rate that is exactly what the equations would

0:32:15.680 --> 0:32:21.600
 predict. And they thought it was just that people didn't need to have as high metabolic rate

0:32:21.600 --> 0:32:26.440
 in warmer climates, but then that was pretty much disproven.

0:32:26.440 --> 0:32:27.720
 One of the ways they disproved it

0:32:27.720 --> 0:32:29.520
 was by going to check the Mayans.

0:32:29.520 --> 0:32:31.440
 That's why they went and looked at the Mayans

0:32:31.440 --> 0:32:32.260
 and they were like, well, no,

0:32:32.260 --> 0:32:34.160
 the Mayans actually have a metabolic rate

0:32:34.160 --> 0:32:36.300
 10% higher than Americans.

0:32:36.300 --> 0:32:38.760
 But what's interesting is today,

0:32:38.760 --> 0:32:42.400
 if you look at people in Chicago, in New York,

0:32:42.400 --> 0:32:44.840
 they have the same metabolic rate

0:32:44.840 --> 0:32:46.080
 as the Southern

0:32:46.080 --> 0:32:52.440
 college women of the 30s who had a metabolic rate 15% below the general

0:32:52.440 --> 0:32:57.960
 population. And so, you know, something was causing those women to have a low

0:32:57.960 --> 0:33:01.440
 metabolic rate and now everyone has a low metabolic rate. And if you look at

0:33:01.440 --> 0:33:07.400
 the history of kind of oil consumption, well, you know, cottonseed oil was the first oil

0:33:07.400 --> 0:33:13.920
 and USDA data from the 1930s will tell you that much more of

0:33:13.920 --> 0:33:17.560
 the cottonseed oil was consumed in the South before it was

0:33:17.560 --> 0:33:18.840
 consumed in the North.

0:33:20.680 --> 0:33:29.760
 Yeah, during this period, thyroid disease, low thyroid function was increasing steadily

0:33:29.760 --> 0:33:51.680
 and rapidly. And an interesting fact that is seldom discussed is that George Burr himself, the promoter of PUFA essentiality, in 1932 or 1933, did experiments on his rats,

0:33:51.680 --> 0:34:00.480
 showing that when he made them deficient, according to his definition, in unsaturated

0:34:00.480 --> 0:34:05.000
 fats, their metabolic rate was 50% higher

0:34:05.460 --> 0:34:07.060
 than what he called normal.

0:34:08.420 --> 0:34:13.420
 So he was making normal ads and calling them sick.

0:34:14.360 --> 0:34:15.200
 Interesting.

0:34:18.160 --> 0:34:20.980
 Yeah, Dr. P, I recently took,

0:34:20.980 --> 0:34:24.460
 I actually stumbled across those papers recently

0:34:24.460 --> 0:34:25.960
 and I was looking at them.

0:34:25.960 --> 0:34:27.820
 And what I was wondering is,

0:34:31.160 --> 0:34:35.080
 it looked to me like the amount of PUFA

0:34:35.080 --> 0:34:38.360
 in those rat diets that made them hypermetabolic

0:34:38.360 --> 0:34:43.360
 was almost below the rate

0:34:43.500 --> 0:34:48.800
 that one could get in a normal mixed diet. You know what I mean?

0:34:50.000 --> 0:35:01.040
 Yeah, but one person in his lab tried it on himself for six months, the laboratory purification

0:35:05.000 --> 0:35:07.540
 purification to try to create a human version of his rats.

0:35:12.540 --> 0:35:13.460
 And his PUFA levels did gradually go down

0:35:15.700 --> 0:35:20.700
 and after about four months, all of this man's prior symptoms disappeared

0:35:21.320 --> 0:35:26.820
 and didn't recur when he went back to his usual diet.

0:35:26.820 --> 0:35:31.820
 But all he demonstrated was that doing his best

0:35:32.360 --> 0:35:35.160
 to eliminate PUFA for several months

0:35:36.140 --> 0:35:39.160
 improved his health very noticeably.

0:35:40.600 --> 0:35:42.560
 Yeah, that's great.

0:35:44.760 --> 0:35:47.320
 Brad, you mentioned in, what was it, the 1930s,

0:35:47.320 --> 0:35:50.160
 you looked at the caloric intake.

0:35:50.160 --> 0:35:53.280
 It was like 5,000 calories per person or something

0:35:53.280 --> 0:35:55.640
 that the USDA, what was that?

0:35:55.640 --> 0:36:00.640
 Right, so the USDA, in the 1939 yearbook of agriculture,

0:36:03.240 --> 0:36:06.080
 which is, the Yearbook of Agriculture

0:36:06.080 --> 0:36:10.360
 is like the USDA's big publication for the year.

0:36:10.360 --> 0:36:13.160
 And I think it was more important back then than it is now.

0:36:13.160 --> 0:36:14.400
 I don't even know if they still do it.

0:36:14.400 --> 0:36:17.360
 But back then, to be written up

0:36:17.360 --> 0:36:19.880
 in the Yearbook of Agriculture was a big deal.

0:36:19.880 --> 0:36:22.940
 And so this is the USDA's really flagship publication

0:36:22.940 --> 0:36:25.620
 from back then in 1939.

0:36:25.620 --> 0:36:27.240
 And every year it's about a different topic.

0:36:27.240 --> 0:36:29.420
 So one year it might be about soil.

0:36:29.420 --> 0:36:33.920
 The next year it's about you know, this one was called food and life.

0:36:33.920 --> 0:36:44.960
 And so they reported on on American diets and and they're the USDA publications are

0:36:44.960 --> 0:36:48.240
 very much about economics, right? They're not about

0:36:49.020 --> 0:36:51.020
 So the point of the study was not

0:36:52.660 --> 0:36:56.200
 Really about nutrition it was about

0:36:59.020 --> 0:37:01.020
 How much people

0:37:01.040 --> 0:37:03.840
 How much food different families bought?

0:37:04.800 --> 0:37:07.820
 people, how much food different families bought given different income brackets, right?

0:37:07.820 --> 0:37:09.320
 That was really what it was about.

0:37:09.320 --> 0:37:12.600
 But then they indexed all of the numbers and saying,

0:37:12.600 --> 0:37:14.480
 okay, well, is this a good diet?

0:37:14.480 --> 0:37:15.360
 Is this enough calories?

0:37:15.360 --> 0:37:16.520
 This is enough protein.

0:37:16.520 --> 0:37:20.520
 And interestingly, in those old USDA publications,

0:37:20.520 --> 0:37:23.120
 there does not seem to be a concept

0:37:23.120 --> 0:37:25.120
 that eating too much is bad.

0:37:26.300 --> 0:37:29.580
 That concept apparently did not exist yet

0:37:29.580 --> 0:37:33.280
 because there's not even like a hesitation

0:37:33.280 --> 0:37:35.420
 where they say, well, maybe you shouldn't eat this much,

0:37:35.420 --> 0:37:37.380
 but here's what these people do.

0:37:37.380 --> 0:37:41.420
 There's no, when you read the pros from back then,

0:37:41.420 --> 0:37:48.500
 it seems like, well, more food is more nutrition is more better. There's no, you know, they

0:37:48.500 --> 0:37:53.640
 don't, that's just, it's just more is better. That's what they

0:37:53.640 --> 0:37:56.980
 thought in the 1930s, right? And so you're like, well, that in

0:37:56.980 --> 0:37:59.660
 and of itself is interesting, the fact that they're not

0:37:59.740 --> 0:38:02.260
 saying, like, but watch your calories, like, there's none of

0:38:02.260 --> 0:38:12.360
 that language. And so, right, and so what they, an interesting thing about this is, in the 1930s, if people could afford to

0:38:12.360 --> 0:38:21.680
 buy and eat more food, they did. And so what you find is that the most, the families who

0:38:21.680 --> 0:38:25.280
 were eating the most most were the wealthiest

0:38:27.640 --> 0:38:28.320
 city dwellers basically and so

0:38:35.120 --> 0:38:38.400
 You know probably the least active people probably lawyers and doctors, you know, these are not day laborers, right? They're not the ones who can afford the most and best food

0:38:38.960 --> 0:38:40.960
 and and it's all

0:38:42.040 --> 0:38:47.720
 The numbers are all averaged to what an adult male would eat.

0:38:47.720 --> 0:38:51.640
 And they don't tell us exactly how they do that math.

0:38:51.640 --> 0:38:54.740
 But by the estimation of the USDA in 1939,

0:38:54.740 --> 0:38:59.740
 the richest East Coast cities,

0:39:00.200 --> 0:39:02.520
 the average man would have been consuming

0:39:02.520 --> 0:39:04.500
 something like 4,500 calories.

0:39:04.500 --> 0:39:05.760
 Interestingly, on the west coast

0:39:06.680 --> 0:39:12.160
 The number is like 5,100 calories. So according to the USDA in the 1939

0:39:13.720 --> 0:39:17.440
 Wealthy, you know a doctor living in San Francisco or

0:39:18.120 --> 0:39:22.080
 Portland would have been consuming a little over 5,000 calories a day

0:39:22.880 --> 0:39:24.880
 normally

0:39:23.700 --> 0:39:25.540
 assuming a little over 5,000 calories a day normally.

0:39:27.380 --> 0:39:29.860
 That's a man or everybody? That's per adult male.

0:39:29.860 --> 0:39:32.400
 And so you have to assume that it's gonna be less

0:39:32.400 --> 0:39:35.260
 for a woman or for a 12 year old, you know, but it's,

0:39:35.260 --> 0:39:36.500
 and they have some, they have formulas.

0:39:36.500 --> 0:39:39.460
 So 4,000 to 5,000 calories a day.

0:39:40.380 --> 0:39:43.020
 Absolutely, that is what the USDA says.

0:39:43.020 --> 0:39:45.800
 Dr. Pete, do you think that, is that accurate?

0:39:45.800 --> 0:39:47.000
 Oh yeah.

0:39:47.000 --> 0:39:49.200
 What were they eating back then?

0:39:49.200 --> 0:39:54.100
 I mean, it's actually quite explicit.

0:39:54.100 --> 0:39:58.400
 It's, the USDA will tell you, it's flour, butter, sugar,

0:39:58.400 --> 0:40:05.000
 potatoes, pork, some beef, a lot of dairy, you know, milk.

0:40:06.480 --> 0:40:07.960
 Lots of chicken at the time or no?

0:40:07.960 --> 0:40:09.880
 Nope, not much chicken.

0:40:10.880 --> 0:40:13.080
 Fatty fish, poof of fish, nuts?

0:40:13.080 --> 0:40:14.360
 No, no.

0:40:16.560 --> 0:40:20.440
 It's, you know, it's meat and potatoes and flour and sugar.

0:40:20.440 --> 0:40:22.360
 You know, they're eating apple pie, right?

0:40:22.360 --> 0:40:24.620
 They're eating apple pie and they're eating mashed potatoes

0:40:24.620 --> 0:40:25.880
 and they're eating pork chops.

0:40:27.040 --> 0:40:29.200
 They were just tearing into that stuff. And they didn't have the

0:40:29.200 --> 0:40:31.120
 obesity rates like we do today, huh?

0:40:31.480 --> 0:40:34.040
 Right. And they're drinking it with whole milk and probably

0:40:34.040 --> 0:40:37.440
 fresh baked bread. And, and that, and that's what people

0:40:37.440 --> 0:40:37.600
 ate.

0:40:37.640 --> 0:40:40.000
 Was there was the bread back then not as messed up

0:40:40.000 --> 0:40:42.360
 genetically as the bread we have? Was that a part of the

0:40:42.360 --> 0:40:42.600
 fact?

0:40:42.600 --> 0:40:46.560
 Well, it would not yet have been the hybridized wheat

0:40:46.560 --> 0:40:51.240
 that we got coming out of, you know, Mexico post 1970,

0:40:51.240 --> 0:40:55.000
 but yeah, so it would have been

0:40:55.000 --> 0:40:57.780
 old fashioned varieties of wheat, yes.

0:40:57.780 --> 0:41:00.480
 Dr. Peet, should we be eating 5,000 calories a day?

0:41:01.720 --> 0:41:02.560
 Yes.

0:41:03.600 --> 0:41:11.800
 If you choose your foods the way they used to. When I worked for the Bureau

0:41:11.800 --> 0:41:31.200
 of Land Management in the 1950s in the woods, we had a cook who was at the time in his 50s and had learned cooking in the Navy in the 1930s and 40s.

0:41:31.200 --> 0:41:57.000
 And our diet was just a tremendous amount of food, all of it tending to be saturated and carbohydrate, lots of steak and ham, eggs,

0:41:57.000 --> 0:42:09.280
 a huge bowl of some breakfast cereal first thing in the morning, and then pancakes and ham and eggs as the

0:42:09.280 --> 0:42:11.680
 main course of breakfast.

0:42:11.680 --> 0:42:31.120
 And all we wanted to pack in a grain bag tied to our belts to eat for lunch and then huge dinners, very often a pound of steak

0:42:31.120 --> 0:42:54.080
 as the main course, but with soup and cold meats, cheeses, boiled eggs, everything else besides the pound of steak and various vegetables

0:42:54.080 --> 0:42:55.080
 for carbohydrates.

0:42:55.080 --> 0:42:59.040
 And everybody was really lean, I bet, huh?

0:42:59.040 --> 0:43:00.040
 Yeah.

0:43:00.040 --> 0:43:05.000
 I calculated that I was eating about 9,000 calories a day.

0:43:07.280 --> 0:43:09.200
 So now the argument would be, well,

0:43:09.200 --> 0:43:11.280
 back then everybody was exercising way more

0:43:11.280 --> 0:43:12.680
 and we're all a bunch of couch potatoes.

0:43:12.680 --> 0:43:15.160
 So that's why we can't eat 5,000 calories a day.

0:43:15.160 --> 0:43:16.860
 What would you say to that, Dr. B?

0:43:18.040 --> 0:43:20.760
 Oh, yeah.

0:43:20.760 --> 0:43:23.480
 My work was just walking through the woods,

0:43:24.720 --> 0:43:27.000
 putting plants on the map.

0:43:27.000 --> 0:43:32.640
 It wasn't heavy work.

0:43:32.640 --> 0:43:36.760
 Just basically walking.

0:43:36.760 --> 0:43:41.920
 So were you doing like, were you doing any cardio in that job or anything to do 9,000

0:43:41.920 --> 0:43:45.380
 calories a day and not be overweight or whatever?

0:43:45.380 --> 0:43:47.020
 No, not at all.

0:43:47.020 --> 0:43:49.220
 I mean, I don't think, Dr. Pete,

0:43:49.220 --> 0:43:52.700
 people didn't really do cardio

0:43:52.700 --> 0:43:56.060
 for the sake of doing cardio back then.

0:43:56.060 --> 0:43:57.080
 Is that correct?

0:43:57.080 --> 0:43:58.700
 That's been my impression.

0:43:58.700 --> 0:44:01.340
 Yeah, never heard of it back then.

0:44:01.340 --> 0:44:03.260
 When did cardio get invented?

0:44:03.260 --> 0:44:04.100
 Like the 70s.

0:44:05.000 --> 0:44:05.400
 back then. When did cardio get invented? Like the seventies? Uh,

0:44:09.760 --> 0:44:10.120
 yeah. John Kennedy, uh, with his touch football,

0:44:14.400 --> 0:44:14.760
 uh, and so on. Uh, and Sputnik in the fifties, uh,

0:44:18.280 --> 0:44:18.360
 they did tests and found that, uh, uh,

0:44:21.960 --> 0:44:22.000
 Americans, uh, even in their teams, uh,

0:44:28.960 --> 0:44:39.120
 were by far the weakest people in the world. So as part of the response to Sputnik, the government started promoting various types of exercise, but then the Kennedys

0:44:40.320 --> 0:44:45.000
 popularized the idea of jogging. that came on in the 60s.

0:44:50.320 --> 0:44:52.680
 So gentlemen, help me understand something here.

0:44:52.680 --> 0:44:56.720
 So 1930s, you guys are saying that there's this rise

0:44:56.720 --> 0:44:59.720
 in these low metabolic rates for women, right?

0:44:59.720 --> 0:45:01.440
 And you, Brad, were suggesting

0:45:01.440 --> 0:45:03.880
 that's cottonseed oil doing that, or?

0:45:03.880 --> 0:45:12.320
 Well, my suggestion is it's cottonseed oil. But what I can say is that the metabolic rate

0:45:12.320 --> 0:45:19.480
 happening in the 1930s in women is real, and it's captured by at least four different universities.

0:45:19.480 --> 0:45:26.800
 And then a university in the North redid their study again and said, nope, our metabolic rates have not changed.

0:45:26.800 --> 0:45:27.920
 There's something different

0:45:27.920 --> 0:45:29.620
 about the metabolic rates in the South.

0:45:29.620 --> 0:45:33.180
 And I've postulated that this could be due

0:45:33.180 --> 0:45:35.480
 to the rise of cottonseed oil in the South,

0:45:35.480 --> 0:45:37.280
 but no one did that experiment.

0:45:37.280 --> 0:45:40.340
 We don't know why, but it definitely did drop.

0:45:41.600 --> 0:45:44.960
 So why do we still see,

0:45:44.960 --> 0:45:49.800
 like, I'm just trying to map this damage, I'm trying to investigate

0:45:49.800 --> 0:45:52.000
 this train wreck that happened in the last century.

0:45:52.000 --> 0:45:56.120
 I'm like, look, I mean, as best as I can as an armchair detective here, I'm sitting here

0:45:56.120 --> 0:46:02.280
 and I'm thinking, okay, so you're seeing already in the 30s a drop in metabolic rate, and you're

0:46:02.280 --> 0:46:04.680
 linking that to cottonseed oil or maybe something else.

0:46:04.680 --> 0:46:11.520
 Dr. Pete might have something to suggest there, but then what happens like why is it that they you know the famous thing people?

0:46:11.520 --> 0:46:16.520
 I think was you or somebody's showing photos of people lining up to see Star Wars in the 1970s

0:46:16.680 --> 0:46:20.600
 And everybody's thin as a rail is that you that posted those photos or somebody else?

0:46:20.600 --> 0:46:23.840
 Those are not mine, but I know good rich or somebody posted

0:46:23.840 --> 0:46:25.000
 Yeah, and they're like and then they show you know Those are somebody else. Those are not mine, but I know what you mean. Booker or Goodrich or somebody posted it. Yeah.

0:46:25.000 --> 0:46:28.760
 And they're like, and then they show the 2000s, people lining up for Star Wars and everybody's

0:46:28.760 --> 0:46:29.760
 obese almost.

0:46:29.760 --> 0:46:31.140
 And it's like, what happened?

0:46:31.140 --> 0:46:35.240
 So what was going on that in the seven, you're saying the metabolic rates were dropping low

0:46:35.240 --> 0:46:36.240
 in the thirties.

0:46:36.240 --> 0:46:40.600
 Well, why do we see, why does it like, how come it takes to the seventies, eighties,

0:46:40.600 --> 0:46:45.080
 nineties before this explosion and obesity and diabetes and all this other stuff.

0:46:45.080 --> 0:46:46.080
 Or maybe I've got it wrong.

0:46:46.080 --> 0:46:47.080
 Can someone help me?

0:46:47.080 --> 0:46:59.680
 I think it was the very heavy propaganda starting in the 50s for polyunsaturated fats as more

0:46:59.680 --> 0:47:06.220
 than an essential nutrient as a way to protect against heart disease.

0:47:08.020 --> 0:47:08.860
 Okay.

0:47:08.860 --> 0:47:12.980
 Yeah, I mean, and I think what Dr. Peete means

0:47:12.980 --> 0:47:14.560
 is that if you look at the amount

0:47:14.560 --> 0:47:17.780
 of vegetable oil consumption,

0:47:17.780 --> 0:47:22.780
 it was sort of creeping up in the 30s, 40s, 50s.

0:47:36.560 --> 0:47:45.000
 up in the 30s, 40s, 50s, it didn't really explode until the 60s and 70s, even 80s, 90s. I think that my suspicion is that for most people, sure, like, you know,

0:47:45.840 --> 0:47:47.940
 I think this is a long-term process.

0:47:47.940 --> 0:47:52.000
 I think where you start to ingest too much PUFA,

0:47:52.000 --> 0:47:56.600
 your metabolic rate probably dips to the most,

0:47:56.600 --> 0:47:58.840
 for a lot of people, that might,

0:48:00.040 --> 0:48:02.640
 the fact that you're not burning fuel as fast,

0:48:02.640 --> 0:48:06.080
 that might mean your appetite dips for a while

0:48:06.080 --> 0:48:08.160
 and you maybe might, you know,

0:48:08.160 --> 0:48:11.320
 it seems like people at a certain age,

0:48:11.320 --> 0:48:13.360
 their kind of weight gets kind of set.

0:48:13.360 --> 0:48:17.080
 And then I feel like you start to see the obesity oftentimes

0:48:17.080 --> 0:48:18.000
 in the next generation.

0:48:18.000 --> 0:48:19.720
 And I'm not sure exactly what,

0:48:19.720 --> 0:48:21.720
 I don't understand exactly what drives that.

0:48:21.720 --> 0:48:24.480
 I'm not trying to pretend that I understand it.

0:48:24.480 --> 0:48:27.280
 But I think that the the polyunsaturated

0:48:27.280 --> 0:48:31.080
 fats are much more damaging to kids. And I think that you see

0:48:31.080 --> 0:48:35.540
 every generation, you see higher childhood obesity. And then, you

0:48:35.540 --> 0:48:39.920
 know, when once you're obese in childhood, you're going to

0:48:39.920 --> 0:48:43.080
 probably fight obesity for your life, you know,

0:48:43.280 --> 0:48:45.480
 that's a genetic switch that turns on or something?

0:48:45.480 --> 0:48:47.960
 I don't, no, I don't believe it's a genetic switch.

0:48:47.960 --> 0:48:50.680
 I just believe that in a growing,

0:48:50.680 --> 0:48:54.640
 like in a growing child before your metabolism is set

0:48:54.640 --> 0:48:59.200
 and your adipose tissue has matured and your,

0:48:59.200 --> 0:49:02.140
 you know, there's a lot of things as you grow that gets,

0:49:02.140 --> 0:49:04.340
 you know, a child is very plastic

0:49:04.340 --> 0:49:06.440
 and can adapt to a lot of situations. And at some

0:49:06.440 --> 0:49:10.440
 point, you sort of are set the way that you are. And it's not

0:49:10.440 --> 0:49:14.080
 to say that you can't change these things. But, you know, I

0:49:14.080 --> 0:49:18.540
 see personally, I see obesity is something that often happens in

0:49:18.540 --> 0:49:22.120
 your youth very young. I mean, I was obese by the time that I was

0:49:22.960 --> 0:49:26.020
 in first grade.

0:49:27.700 --> 0:49:30.800
 There's no reason for that. You know, I wasn't like out.

0:49:32.740 --> 0:49:35.720
 I wasn't out at the all you can eat buffet all night.

0:49:35.720 --> 0:49:36.560
 I was an active kid.

0:49:36.560 --> 0:49:37.380
 I was running around.

0:49:37.380 --> 0:49:39.620
 Were you eating 9,000 calories a day like Dr. Pete?

0:49:39.620 --> 0:49:40.780
 Well, not in kindergarten.

0:49:40.780 --> 0:49:41.860
 And that's the thing, I wasn't.

0:49:41.860 --> 0:49:43.700
 I wasn't eating that much.

0:49:43.700 --> 0:49:46.560
 Like my mom was very, like my mom didn't buy us.

0:49:46.880 --> 0:49:50.480
 We didn't get bacon. My mom thought that was bad. It was too

0:49:50.480 --> 0:49:54.080
 high in fat. We didn't get that. We didn't have margarine, though.

0:49:54.080 --> 0:49:56.880
 We did not have butter, because butter was bad. That was bad. We

0:49:56.880 --> 0:50:01.400
 had margarine. And so, despite the fact that everything in our

0:50:01.400 --> 0:50:04.600
 house was low-fat, and it was lean, and it was low-calorie,

0:50:04.600 --> 0:50:06.420
 and we had skim milk, we had all the things that everything in our house was like low fat and it was lean and it was low calorie and we had skim milk, right?

0:50:06.420 --> 0:50:07.260
 We had skim milk.

0:50:07.260 --> 0:50:09.620
 We had all the things that we were supposed to have

0:50:09.620 --> 0:50:13.260
 and yet by kindergarten, I was chubby, right?

0:50:13.260 --> 0:50:17.020
 And so my mom was doing everything right

0:50:17.020 --> 0:50:19.340
 except that the only cooking oils we had,

0:50:19.340 --> 0:50:23.020
 which we used judiciously were vegetable oil based.

0:50:24.140 --> 0:50:25.800
 You know, we had margarine on our toes,

0:50:25.800 --> 0:50:28.080
 but like we weren't, you know,

0:50:28.080 --> 0:50:31.920
 my mom was very careful about feeding us things

0:50:31.920 --> 0:50:33.760
 that she thought would make us fat, right?

0:50:33.760 --> 0:50:35.700
 Like that was, we didn't have soda in the house.

0:50:35.700 --> 0:50:39.380
 Like we, my mom tried to do everything she could

0:50:39.380 --> 0:50:42.360
 to avoid that for us, but yet it didn't work.

0:50:42.360 --> 0:50:44.520
 And my parents both struggled with their weight

0:50:44.520 --> 0:50:49.320
 and all of us kids, you know, to one degree or another, struggled with our

0:50:49.320 --> 0:50:53.480
 weight. And so, you know, you can see that it starts very young, and it's

0:50:53.480 --> 0:50:57.280
 notâ€”you can do all of the right things, and it still happensâ€”the right

0:50:57.280 --> 0:51:04.840
 things, and it still happens, right? We know that. And so, Iâ€”yeah, and so that's

0:51:04.840 --> 0:51:07.120
 where I think it does. I think there is

0:51:07.120 --> 0:51:10.320
 sort of a generational knowledge, or it's just that

0:51:10.320 --> 0:51:15.120
 children are very apt to the particular damages as you're

0:51:15.120 --> 0:51:19.520
 growing if there's too much PUFA around. Dr. Peete, any

0:51:19.520 --> 0:51:30.500
 thoughts on that? Yeah, I think it's all epigenetic, induced by the environment.

0:51:30.500 --> 0:51:42.760
 And the real problem is that we don't have any science left, science in the abstract

0:51:42.760 --> 0:51:45.000
 sense of objectivity.

0:51:45.780 --> 0:51:50.780
 What we have is industry guided propaganda research.

0:51:53.400 --> 0:51:58.400
 The nutritional so-called science

0:51:58.600 --> 0:52:03.600
 is under the heavy dominating influence

0:52:04.200 --> 0:52:06.640
 of the food industry.

0:52:06.640 --> 0:52:12.440
 Dr. Peete, do you think that they know that their stuff is that bad or they just choose

0:52:12.440 --> 0:52:16.560
 to ignore the science that suggests their products, these PUFA products are bad, these

0:52:16.560 --> 0:52:18.360
 high PUFA oils?

0:52:18.360 --> 0:52:33.720
 It's bad for their business to do actual science. They choose what gets published and what gets taught in the universities.

0:52:33.720 --> 0:52:53.760
 I forget exactly what year it was, sometime in the late 80s I think. I had been traveling around giving talks on the dangers of PUFA, and on one trip I had

0:52:53.760 --> 0:52:58.400
 talks scheduled up and down the West Coast.

0:52:58.400 --> 0:53:05.000
 And on that trip, every time I would get to a site, it would mysteriously be locked up.

0:53:05.840 --> 0:53:10.840
 And if we held the talk, it would be at some,

0:53:13.520 --> 0:53:15.200
 someone's house locally.

0:53:16.760 --> 0:53:19.420
 When I got to the last stop,

0:53:20.680 --> 0:53:25.000
 I found that not only the auditorium was locked up,

0:53:26.580 --> 0:53:29.740
 none of the publicity had been done,

0:53:29.740 --> 0:53:33.800
 and the person who had scheduled my talk had been fired.

0:53:35.300 --> 0:53:40.200
 Just 100% intervention mysteriously.

0:53:41.880 --> 0:53:49.800
 Some outside influence caused all of these sites to close up and pretend that

0:53:49.800 --> 0:53:58.180
 nothing had been scheduled. When was this? I forget the year, but probably 86 or 88

0:53:58.180 --> 0:54:03.080
 around then. How many people were like you talking about seed oils and

0:54:03.080 --> 0:54:07.520
 universities and the dangers of high PUFA? Is that what you were talking about, I'm assuming?

0:54:07.520 --> 0:54:12.400
 Yeah, and I didn't know anyone else who was doing it.

0:54:12.400 --> 0:54:16.280
 You didn't know anyone? There's no academician or anybody that was talking

0:54:16.280 --> 0:54:20.680
 or lecturing out publicly? No. There's basically, you've been a voice in the

0:54:20.680 --> 0:54:33.840
 wilderness here for a while, huh? Yeah's pretty. Yeah. In doing my dissertation research, I came across the history of age pigment

0:54:34.880 --> 0:54:45.000
 and what the factors are that cause that. The polyunsaturated fats and respiratory stress

0:54:47.700 --> 0:54:51.880
 caused by such things as estrogen dominance

0:54:53.020 --> 0:54:56.940
 led to the formation of age pigment,

0:54:56.940 --> 0:55:01.500
 which is an alternative electron acceptor,

0:55:02.860 --> 0:55:12.760
 a last ditch effort of the stressed organism to consume electrons so that life

0:55:12.760 --> 0:55:34.000
 could continue. Abnormal consumption of electrons has its own effects, intensifying the effects of stress,

0:55:34.000 --> 0:55:38.600
 estrogen, and damage to the mitochondria.

0:55:38.600 --> 0:55:50.160
 But the role of PUFA that I ran across in trying to understand the effect of reproductive aging.

0:55:50.160 --> 0:56:03.760
 That was the core of my subsequent thought giving importance to the dangers of PUFA.

0:56:03.760 --> 0:56:07.400
 So is that what you were talking about in those lectures that were being mysteriously

0:56:07.400 --> 0:56:09.400
 canceled when you would show up?

0:56:09.400 --> 0:56:10.400
 Yeah.

0:56:10.400 --> 0:56:15.040
 Were they all fired or just one gentleman was fired, you said?

0:56:15.040 --> 0:56:23.760
 The only one that I inquired about was a person I had known, and it was caused by the fact

0:56:23.760 --> 0:56:27.600
 that he had scheduled my lecture.

0:56:27.600 --> 0:56:32.600
 Did any of your work in the 80s or 90s hit the popular press at all in any local newspapers

0:56:32.600 --> 0:56:33.600
 or anything?

0:56:33.600 --> 0:56:36.480
 Or was it creating buzz back then?

0:56:36.480 --> 0:56:42.840
 No, I don't know of any reporting about it.

0:56:42.840 --> 0:56:46.480
 So what do youâ€”I'm just curious, I don't want to go off too, but I just got to ask you,

0:56:46.480 --> 0:56:48.760
 what do you think about all this newfound interest

0:56:48.760 --> 0:56:49.600
 in seed oils?

0:56:49.600 --> 0:56:51.480
 I mean, you've been out there talking about them

0:56:51.480 --> 0:56:53.880
 as a lonely voice, that must be maddening

0:56:53.880 --> 0:56:56.800
 when nobody else seems to pay attention

0:56:56.800 --> 0:56:58.400
 or listen to what you're saying,

0:56:58.400 --> 0:57:01.240
 decade and decade and then now all of a sudden,

0:57:01.240 --> 0:57:03.180
 because of the internet and things going on,

0:57:03.180 --> 0:57:05.320
 there's this newfound explosion

0:57:05.320 --> 0:57:10.120
 of people talking about seed oils and how toxic and damaging they are to our health.

0:57:10.120 --> 0:57:12.680
 How does that make you, what do you think of that?

0:57:12.680 --> 0:57:16.040
 Oh, I'm glad it's finally happening.

0:57:16.040 --> 0:57:30.520
 Did you think it would happen sooner? I did my best to try to get people thinking about it.

0:57:30.520 --> 0:57:34.720
 Do you feel that the corporate forces are going to continually suppress this information

0:57:34.720 --> 0:57:37.360
 from being popularly reported?

0:57:37.360 --> 0:57:54.560
 Yeah, it's exactly the same thing throughout the culture. The giant corporations have taken over everything, and if the people don't get wise, the whole

0:57:54.560 --> 0:57:59.240
 system is in the process of dying, killing itself.

0:57:59.240 --> 0:58:00.240
 Yeah, that's true.

0:58:00.240 --> 0:58:10.720
 Dr. Peete, I wanted to ask you if we could do a thought experiment for a moment. Supposing that we eliminated all the seed oils over the last, the 20th century, but everybody

0:58:10.720 --> 0:58:16.160
 was still eating the same amounts of nuts and high poof of fish and high poof of chicken and pork,

0:58:16.880 --> 0:58:22.880
 would we have seen similar explosions in the rate of obesity? Or, I mean, is it really the seed oils

0:58:22.880 --> 0:58:26.160
 driving the obesity explosion, or is it actually the

0:58:26.160 --> 0:58:29.440
 other high PUFA natural products, or, you know, relatively natural?

0:58:29.440 --> 0:58:34.480
 I guess it's kind of debatable whether the amount of PUFA in chicken fat and pork fat,

0:58:34.480 --> 0:58:37.400
 as Brad could attest, maybe that's not so natural.

0:58:37.400 --> 0:58:51.360
 But would it still result in a similar explosion in obesity and other issues? Chicken and pork fat has changed radically over the decades.

0:58:51.360 --> 0:59:00.080
 Roughly every 15 or 20 years, the government has revised downward the amount of cholesterol

0:59:00.080 --> 0:59:05.000
 in an egg, going back about 60 years.

0:59:05.000 --> 0:59:10.000
 And every time they examine the average commercial egg,

0:59:12.360 --> 0:59:15.160
 they find that the cholesterol is much lower

0:59:15.160 --> 0:59:16.640
 than they thought.

0:59:16.640 --> 0:59:20.200
 And it's the shift of the chicken's diet

0:59:21.720 --> 0:59:31.280
 causing the defective egg production loaded up with PUFA, deficient in cholesterol.

0:59:31.280 --> 0:59:38.320
 But do you think, I guess what I'm saying is, how much of a role would, if people didn't

0:59:38.320 --> 0:59:46.200
 eat seed oils, but they ate the same amount of high PUFA of fish, high poof of nuts?

0:59:46.200 --> 0:59:49.240
 Would we still have the same rates of obesity or would it be cut in half?

0:59:49.240 --> 0:59:52.600
 I'm just speculating here out loud here.

0:59:52.600 --> 0:59:55.320
 Yeah.

0:59:55.320 --> 1:00:13.000
 You wouldn't naturally choose that much fish and fat chicken and pork and so on, as you can get in the bottled seed oils.

1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:23.000
 But still, those changes are industry-promoted and damaging the population.

1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:26.360
 So justâ€”and Brad, maybe you can help me understand this,

1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:28.240
 or both of you, because I'm trying to see,

1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:31.200
 like, if we could wave a magic wand,

1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:33.520
 because there's a lot of people getting on this no seed oil

1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:36.360
 bandwagon, but I want to know how much of the problem

1:00:36.360 --> 1:00:39.800
 that we're identifying here about obesity

1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:42.680
 is triggered by these other high PUFA sources,

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:47.320
 like nuts and seeds and these fish

1:00:47.320 --> 1:00:49.740
 and the chicken and pork.

1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:54.120
 People are being propagandized to make those choices

1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:57.840
 that no one would have thought of making on their own.

1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:00.800
 Yeah, and I see,

1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:05.000
 it's hard to tease out.

1:01:06.020 --> 1:01:10.240
 I mean, Ana, you see the broad trends happening, right?

1:01:10.240 --> 1:01:13.100
 And you see what happens in lab rats.

1:01:13.100 --> 1:01:18.100
 And what I see is that the, well,

1:01:20.460 --> 1:01:24.340
 the triggering event of eating a lot of seed oils,

1:01:24.340 --> 1:01:27.800
 of eating a lot of high, yeah, sure, high POOFA chicken and

1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:35.400
 pork, and, and other foods is that and nuts is well, and this

1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:38.720
 is I don't know if we if we've actually got there yet. But the

1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:41.540
 initial proposition, I think of this talk was to talk about

1:01:41.540 --> 1:01:46.240
 reductive stress. And what I see is all of those foods are essentially

1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:55.120
 leading us to a place of what I would call reductive stress, which I'm defining as basically

1:01:55.120 --> 1:02:08.800
 lack of NAD plus or not enough NAD plus. And that that is really, that place is where what is driving the obesity epidemic is essentially this

1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:15.180
 this kind of reductive stress that we're all in and I think that that the things

1:02:15.180 --> 1:02:21.140
 that have really sparked this problem of reductive stress are definitely the seed

1:02:21.140 --> 1:02:28.480
 oils. You know it's hard for me to say exactly the the proportion of that came from high proof of

1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:31.520
 chicken versus seed oils. But But mostly, I mean, when you

1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:35.360
 look at how much seed oils and everything, it feels like that

1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:39.880
 is the primary culprit. Maybe it's 70% or 60%. And the other

1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:40.640
 things are 40%.

1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:43.520
 That's what I'm trying to get a just a ballpark image for me

1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:46.240
 because there's a lot of Tucker I mean Tucker

1:02:46.260 --> 1:02:53.040
 Tucker Goodrich has a citation that he's posted in his Twitter

1:02:53.040 --> 1:02:56.760
 feed and it says like top sources of poofa and the

1:02:56.760 --> 1:03:01.800
 American diet and I'm doing this from memory but I think the

1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:07.680
 number one source is chicken and Number two is another one that I wouldn't have predicted, which

1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:16.320
 is grain-based desserts, so things like cake and cookies

1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:21.960
 and things like that, which I would have guessed French fries

1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:24.320
 and potato chips, number one, and I would have guessed salad,

1:03:24.320 --> 1:03:26.600
 number two, because everybody puts, you know,

1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:29.200
 Kraft dressing made of soybean oil on their salad.

1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:32.160
 But according to that, it's number one is actually poultry.

1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:36.160
 And number two is like cake, which I neither-

1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:38.760
 You're saying fried poultry or just any poultry?

1:03:38.760 --> 1:03:41.720
 Well, it doesn't say, yeah, it might be buffalo wings,

1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:43.120
 you know, fried in soybean oil.

1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:44.880
 So I don't, I don't know.

1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:46.960
 But yeah.

1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:51.960
 Just that chickens themselves are toxic

1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:55.160
 because of their artificial seed oil diet.

1:03:55.160 --> 1:03:58.840
 They are sources of seed oil.

1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:00.800
 They are.

1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:01.620
 Absolutely they are.

1:04:01.620 --> 1:04:03.160
 So you avoid chicken altogether, Dr. Pete,

1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:07.320
 or at least fatty chicken, chicken fat?

1:04:07.320 --> 1:04:17.160
 Basically limiting it to occasional chicken wings deep fried in coconut oil to exchange

1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:25.320
 as much fat as possible for coconut oil. So I want to get-

1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:29.480
 I just want to put a quick plug in for Buffalo, New York,

1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:31.280
 home of the Buffalo wing.

1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:32.100
 Anyway, sorry.

1:04:32.100 --> 1:04:32.940
 Is that where you reside?

1:04:32.940 --> 1:04:34.760
 I know you're up there somewhere.

1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:36.100
 I'm in upstate New York.

1:04:36.100 --> 1:04:39.240
 I really am in the Finger Lakes near,

1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:40.760
 in Shermansburg near Ithaca,

1:04:40.760 --> 1:04:43.120
 but I also spend a lot of time in Buffalo, so.

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:46.480
 And we've got Dr. Pete, you're in Oregon, right, sir?

1:04:46.480 --> 1:04:47.480
 Yeah.

1:04:47.480 --> 1:04:51.920
 So, it's interesting, just like the Indians, the East Coast and the West Coast both independently

1:04:51.920 --> 1:04:54.120
 discovered that PUFA was toxic and high.

1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:55.120
 That's interesting.

1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:58.280
 You guys didn't even know each other's work and you came to the same conclusion.

1:04:58.280 --> 1:05:06.600
 So, I want to hone in on the topic like Brad suggested about reductive stress in our obesity panel, which you both

1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:07.600
 were a part of.

1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:14.420
 I saw, Brad, you were smiling, you know, very happily when you heard Dr. Pete reference

1:05:14.420 --> 1:05:15.540
 reductive stress.

1:05:15.540 --> 1:05:21.880
 So I want you guys to unleash, but try as best as you can to make this accessible for

1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:24.840
 people who are a little new, but don't let it hold you back too much.

1:05:24.840 --> 1:05:26.840
 Go try to find the balance there.

1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:32.360
 Explain what is this reductive stress and how is this connected to PUFA and how is this

1:05:32.360 --> 1:05:54.440
 causing obesity. Bye for now.
