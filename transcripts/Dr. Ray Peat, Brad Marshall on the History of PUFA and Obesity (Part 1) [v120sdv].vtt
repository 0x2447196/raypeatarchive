00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.780
 Today's going to be another exciting discussion, deep dive into nutrition, learning together,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.220
 just having a free flow conversation.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.960
 And I'm joined by two individuals who tell you it's going to be a little hard for me

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.880
 to keep up, but I'm just going to try to catch a tiger by its tail and learn a little bit

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.280
 and hopefully try to translate it to our audience because you guys go into the weeds and that's

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.280
 good.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.360
 We need that.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.160
 And to do so, we have a discussion today on the topic of nutrition, particularly the issue

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
 of seed oils.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.880
 And we're joined by Brad Marshall of FireInABottle.net and Dr. Ray Peat.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.180
 You can visit Dr. Ray Peat's website, raypeat.com and also join his newsletter.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.800
 So Brad and Dr. Peat, thank you for joining us.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.400
 Dr. Brad Marshall Well, thanks for having us.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.160
 I'm excited for the opportunity.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400
 Dr. Raymond Peat Very good.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.320
 Dr. Peat, I wanted to start with you, just some open questions to kind of get us thinking,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.720
 what is the ideal diet for a child?

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.260
 You know, when you're thinking about raising a child, I know my audience is a lot of younger

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.800
 people in their twenties, thirties, maybe they're starting a family and maybe they found

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.840
 this podcast because they're thinking, okay, I just don't know where to go.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.000
 Some people are telling it's all about this or that.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 It's keto.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 It's plant-based.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.840
 It's this or that.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.800
 And is there a little shorthand guidance you might be able to have for our audience, Dr.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.720
 Peat, about what is the best ideal diet for raising and upbringing a young child into

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.720
 the world?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.320
 Dr. Ray Peat It depends on the age.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.000
 Milk is the ideal food until they're about a year old at birth because of the effects

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.960
 of the different oxygen tension and higher estrogen and so on.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:03.840
 At birth, the baby is overloaded with iron and so milk is very low in iron to allow the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.560
 baby to grow into its iron.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:19.480
 And so the apparent iron deficiency of milk is just right.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:31.320
 And so you don't want to listen to the experts that say since plain simple milk is low in

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.760
 iron, the baby needs supplements.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:45.320
 The high estrogen that increases during a woman's pregnancy has a very powerful effect

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.720
 even on borderline iron intake.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.200
 Her body is going to load up on iron under the effects of estrogen.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:05.760
 It becomes nine or ten times as efficient as a man's body at extracting iron from food.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:17.280
 And that guarantees that essentially all babies are going to be born with an excess of iron.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:26.680
 At about a year of age, they will have grown into their overload on iron and so they can

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:41.720
 start eating a mixed diet even before a year if it isn't iron content food like meat.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:56.400
 The metabolic rate is extremely high in newborns, largely because of the absence of polyunsaturated

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.440
 fats in their tissues.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:11.120
 By the common test of so-called essential fatty acids, almost all babies are born deficient

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.480
 in the so-called essential fatty acids.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.640
 But in fact, that's ideal for metabolism and the brain.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:37.160
 As soon as a baby or an animal is born, the exposure like a calf starts growth on milk

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.240
 with a relatively low content of polyunsaturated fats.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:54.200
 As they mature and start eating other foods, their tissue starts loading up on PUFA.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.560
 Same happens in babies that are on a mixed diet.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:10.680
 Their tissues progressively load up on polyunsaturated fats and that increases.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:22.360
 What is the fats from the environment are diluted gradually by the growth of the body.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.040
 So, like the...

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.520
 And where are children getting a lot of their PUFA's in the environment, you're saying?

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.560
 Yeah, from foods other than milk.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:46.240
 And so, as they shift to more environmental foods rather than milk, their PUFA content

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.240
 increases.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:56.960
 But as long as their body is increasing in volume, that is a slow increase.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:07.000
 In the 20s, when growth slows down greatly, the rate of accumulation of PUFA in the tissues

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:21.440
 accelerates and so by middle age, people have a very high content of tissue PUFA and that

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:36.200
 increases into old age and the degenerating, demented brain has a very high level of polyunsaturated

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:49.520
 esters of cholesterol which lowers the free cholesterol in the brain and so impairs all

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:56.240
 of the metabolic processes that free cholesterol should participate in.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:07.800
 And as that lifelong accumulation of PUFA continues, the metabolic rate is like a mirror

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.560
 image of the PUFA concentration.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:21.920
 Everybody has a very high calorie consumption and CO2 production, heat production, but by

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:31.840
 middle and old age, the heat production and caloric requirements are much, much lower.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:42.200
 So you tend to get fat unless you sharply reduce your calorie intake after middle age.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.480
 So if you're at that one-year-old stage and you said you're introducing mixed foods from

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:56.000
 one to two to three to four, what are the best dietary principles to follow in the proper

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.720
 nourishment of a child to reduce that excess PUFA that you're talking about?

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:12.160
 Including the high oil content foods, nuts and seeds are generally very high in PUFA.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:22.080
 A few tropical nuts are safe as far as PUFA go.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.680
 Fatty fish are another source.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:37.320
 We talk about the fish fats as being needed in the brain because the adult and old brain

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:48.200
 has such a high content of what we think of as fish oils, the N-3 highly unsaturated fatty

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:59.360
 acids, but those are exactly corresponding to the decreased cognitive ability and decreased

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.240
 metabolic rate.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:16.760
 And so even though they say the PUFA N-3 long chains are brain foods, they're exactly brain

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.440
 damaging foods.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:34.200
 And so high fat seeds and especially fish, cold water fish with a high fat content should

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.200
 be avoided.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:42.240
 Should children be, should fruit or sugars, you know, table sugar or fruit, should that

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.400
 be limited for children or should that basically be to whatever the child desires?

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.800
 Yeah, basically what they desire.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:10:02.720
 And traditionally oatmeal was one of the first things to introduce into a child's diet.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:14.400
 And that's not terribly high in PUFA, but at least it's very high in carbohydrates.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:25.800
 And during gestation, the brain develops pretty much in proportion to the availability of

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.160
 fructose and glucose.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:39.480
 And the more you displace those by fats, the more you tend to slow metabolism.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:49.920
 So all sorts of carbohydrate, if you take into account their relative lack of PUFA,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:57.600
 all of those are brain activating foods, especially fruit.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.000
 So is it, I mean, there's the common adage that people, parents are worried about their

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.600
 kids eating too much candy, but if you've got, I mean, is it okay for kids to eat candy

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.600
 a lot?

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.880
 I mean, there's a lot of ingredients in there.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.840
 I mean, assuming you had, you know, a candy with a good fat, you know, and lots of sugar

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.320
 and table sugar added, is that okay for kids to eat to their satiation or is that not good?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:31.120
 Well they should tend to eat it in batches, not keep it in their mouth a long time and

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:39.760
 support cavities, but if you eat a lot of it and then rinse your mouth, that's fine.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.760
 Wow.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.760
 That's interesting.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:48.560
 So it's really, that's something that I think is very interesting for folks who, there's

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.680
 a lot of, you know, conventional wisdom that would say, you know, one of the essential

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.760
 things you've got to do if you want to be nutritionally conscious for your children,

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:03.440
 young children, is to limit their access to, you know, table sugar type foods and candies

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.440
 and things like that.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:15.040
 Yeah, that pretty much grew up along with the cholesterol myth in the early 1950s.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:24.360
 The seed oil industry was seriously damaged by the petroleum chemists who learned how

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:32.520
 to make paint and plastics out of petroleum and so they didn't need the seed oils.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:42.640
 And so instead of using the polyunsaturated seed oils for paint and varnish, they decided

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:55.840
 to sell them as human food and pig food, for example, because they found that high proofer

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:07.360
 soybeans and corn were ideal for fattening pigs cheaply for market because of the cheapness

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:14.400
 of producing weight as fat and general growth.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:23.600
 But that, the nutritionists working on how to fatten a pig took the same information.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:32.840
 The rate of growth was the center of what a nutritionist is supposed to do.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:42.400
 A vitamin that makes you put on weight faster was evaluated.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:48.200
 You would give an extract of food and if it made you grow faster, then they would look

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:54.200
 for which component it was and identify that as a vitamin.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:07.440
 But that blurring between fattening pigs and feeding people caused lots of problems.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:16.720
 But the seed oil industry, to convince people that they weren't going to just get fat like

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:29.160
 pigs, there had to be a reason to make people eat the paint stock, the previous oil, seed

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.920
 oils that had been used industrially.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:48.640
 And to do that, they resurrected the work of the Burrs from 1929 and 30, claiming that

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.960
 the pufa are essential nutrients.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:15:02.560
 That was multiply debunked all through the 30s and 40s.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.720
 There was nothing left of the Burrs' claims.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:17.600
 But the seed oil industry brought back the supporters of that doctrine and said they

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:28.440
 simply ignored the disproofs of George Burr's experiments and said if the polyunsaturated

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:34.480
 are essential nutrients, then the more you eat, the better.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:43.240
 And so they looked for a reason for getting people to eat larger amounts of polyunsaturated

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.240
 fats.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:52.920
 That wouldn't do if they would eat a gram a day, which would be implied by the Burrs'

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.640
 research, even though that was wrong.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:05.320
 It wouldn't do the industry any good if people met their nutritional needs with just one

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.520
 gram a day.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:15.800
 So they said the more you eat, the better, because, and then they connected it to the

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:29.000
 fact that these toxic oils lower your cholesterol and they resurrected some other failed research

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 claiming that cholesterol caused heart disease.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:45.480
 It had clearly been established in the 1930s that things that cause heart disease cause

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:54.480
 you to defensively make more cholesterol protectively.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:03.640
 Things like polyunsaturated fats that inhibit your thyroid function, your metabolic rate

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:13.520
 goes down as you eat tapufa, partly because your thyroid hormone simply isn't available

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.560
 as it should be.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:29.880
 And so eating the seed oils lowers your thyroid function, and the thyroid function lowering

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:41.680
 the metabolic rate requires a defensive adaptation to raise the cholesterol.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:50.400
 But it's the low thyroid and the elevated polyunsaturated fats that are damaging the

00:17:50.400 --> 00:18:00.160
 blood vessels, setting up the pro-heart disease situation.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:13.200
 And if anything, the body's attempt to produce the defensive systems against heart disease

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:21.840
 increase cholesterol so you can make more defensive hormones and compensate to bring

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.120
 up your metabolic rate.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:29.240
 And so they got the situation exactly backwards.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:40.120
 The pufa do lower cholesterol, but they do it by creating a heart disease supporting

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.760
 condition.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:58.840
 And that shift to fear cholesterol, then Professor Yedkin wrote a book saying it isn't saturated

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:05.600
 fats that cause cholesterol to rise, it's sugar.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:14.840
 And in fact sugar is part of the defensive system that helps you overcome the suppressive

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.080
 metabolic effect of the pufa.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:29.520
 The sugar helps to restore your cholesterol system, your active pro-respiratory DHEA,

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:37.160
 pregnenolone and progesterone, and protects the cells to prevent heart disease.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:49.880
 So the fear of saturated fats because they simply are not pufa which they wanted to sell,

00:19:49.880 --> 00:20:01.160
 that extended to the sugars which support the saturated fats and protect against the

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.080
 pufa.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:16.040
 And so teaching parents to starve their kids for sugar came about right after the phony

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.120
 cholesterol theory of heart disease.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.120
 Right.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:24.000
 So there's a lot of confusing paradigms on top of each other where we stand today from

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.920
 your position.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.960
 Why is it that if sugar rots your teeth and rots your face out, why would it be healthy

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.960
 though?

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.520
 Why would you swallow quickly and wash your mouth out?

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:42.960
 I mean is that really something we should be eating at that level if it rots your face?

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:54.240
 The problem with cavities is that other things in our metabolism, things that suppress thyroid

00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:06.680
 such as pufa, change the composition of our saliva and the saliva should be very antiseptic

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:17.720
 and with the overall pattern of the diet, our saliva has lost the antiseptic quality

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.480
 that kills mouth bacteria.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:29.800
 So does that mean, and maybe I'm over assuming here, but does that mean that if a child was

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:35.400
 not introduced to these high pufa foods, they avoided the fatty fish, they avoided the seed

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:42.040
 oils, they avoid the nuts with these high pufa foods, does that mean that if they were

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.960
 to eat a high carbohydrate diet, high table sugar even, that there would be less likelihood

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.640
 of cavities coming or no?

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:58.960
 Well tropical people very generally eat a high carbohydrate diet and very generally

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:06.200
 if they're on their traditional diet, have extremely good teeth, but when they shift

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:18.760
 to a diet such as beans and tortillas, nutritionally deficient and higher in pufa from the beans,

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:24.840
 then the problem of tooth decay becomes horrible.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:32.600
 So it's nutritional deficiency plus pufa that is the foundation for a high sugar diet

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.800
 to cause cavities, is that what you're saying?

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.800
 Yeah.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.800
 Okay.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:45.720
 And that works largely through the composition of the saliva and its loss of antiseptic

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.000
 function.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.720
 So Brad, I want to bring you in, any thoughts first?

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.800
 I wanted to ask you about the kid diet thing, but I want to go back and just let, is there

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.320
 anything you heard that you want to ask about or talk about?

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.320
 Yeah.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:09.560
 I mean, it's very interesting to hear Dr. Peat's historical analysis of sort of the

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:16.120
 early days of the vegetable oil industry.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.800
 I'm not old enough to remember a lot of those things.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:27.440
 And so I think that's really valuable insight that Dr. Peat is bringing there is how did

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.040
 we get here?

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:35.640
 And I think that is a very interesting insight that at one point, vegetable oils were made

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:43.120
 into paint or linoleum and then they lost that market and that's when they said, "Hey,

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.680
 maybe we can sell this to people."

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:52.600
 So that's a nice little anecdote and I'm sure that it's true.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:24:01.840
 And so I think that's a very interesting and valuable part of this whole discussion.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:11.400
 I'm not nearly the expert on child nutrition that Dr. Peat probably is.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:18.320
 I don't have kids of my own and I tend to spend my time thinking more about obese adults

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:24.720
 than I do about raising children, although I've raised a lot of piglets.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.520
 You are a pig farmer, so you have some connection to that.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:32.320
 But the reason why I wanted to bring it up is because I think having a starting point

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:39.400
 with a tangible issue where the rubber meets the road, where we're talking about theory

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.120
 and it becomes, "Okay, how are we going to raise a generation?"

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.120
 We have an obesity epidemic.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.120
 Sure.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.560
 And so I want to know, it's like a whodunit mystery novel for me.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.560
 Whodunit.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.560
 Where does this go?

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.560
 Is it the sugar?

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.560
 Is it the carbs?

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.560
 Is it the meat?

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.760
 Is it the PUFAs?

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:59.880
 Is it just seed oils or is Dr. Peat right that the nuts and the high PUFA fish needs

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.920
 to be avoided?

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.000
 I want to figure this out because we have an obesity epidemic for children and if we

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.360
 solve that, then we can know where we're building the next generation.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.360
 Right.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:16.600
 Here's what I will say is that I'm also a student of...

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:24.760
 I like looking at cultures around the world and I know that a lot of grain eating cultures

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:30.900
 in particular, especially rice eating cultures in Asia or let's say the Mayans in Mexico

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.600
 who eat primarily corn.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.200
 So these are very grain-based cultures and if you look at...

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.200
 Dr. Peat was talking about metabolic rate.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:48.240
 If you look at these cultures where they're feeding children primarily relatively low

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:55.520
 PUFA grains, they have very high metabolic rates just as Dr. Peat suggests.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.320
 In fact, the whole cultures have very high metabolic rates.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.280
 And so if you look at time...

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.840
 How low are PUFA grains?

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.720
 What do you think?

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.920
 So most grains, right.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.720
 So most grains are very low in...

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.360
 They're very low in fat overall.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.000
 A lot of the fat that is there is PUFA.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.160
 So like rice, so like if people eat white rice, we're talking like that's a very low

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:26.920
 PUFA food because most of the PUFA that there is is in the bran of the rice and that gets

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.080
 removed when you make it into white rice.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:33.800
 And so rice is low in PUFA to begin with, but when you eat white rice, it's even lower.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.360
 It's like it's 1% or it's...

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.240
 I think it's well under 1% polyunsaturated fat by weight.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.880
 And so you're talking...

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.280
 It's very, very low.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:47.960
 And so like on my blog, I talk about this study about Thai rice farmers and they have

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.880
 just through the roof metabolic rates.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.040
 Like the highest metabolic rate that I've seen in any metabolic study in the world is

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.740
 in female rice farmers in Thailand.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:26:59.740
 But the same thing is true.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:06.080
 Like they studied the Mayans in the 1930s and they showed that the Mayans in the 1930s

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:12.920
 had metabolic rates that were significantly elevated versus the metabolic rates of Americans.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:18.840
 And this is another case where 90% of their calories are coming from corn and corn has

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:24.360
 more PUFA than rice does, but still when you make it into the masa, you remove the...

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.400
 This is the refrigerator.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.440
 This means rubbing.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.900
 You remove the...

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:36.100
 You soak the corn in an alkaline solution and then you remove the husks and the germ.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.520
 And that's where a lot of the oil is.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.680
 So when you eat the tortillas, it has...

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.960
 The traditional processing methods of Mayans, right?

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.560
 Who are one of the earliest people in the world to domesticate corn.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:53.340
 Like they remove a lot of the PUFA in the natural normal processing.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.040
 And so that's why I also sometimes people knee jerk say, "Well, all food processing

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.040
 is bad."

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.640
 And I'm like, "Well, no, I think traditional food processing is actually very smart in

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.440
 what they do because people don't eat...

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.660
 The Mayans didn't eat whole...

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:06.900
 Don't eat whole kernel corn, right?

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:11.440
 They removed the germ first and that's where the oil is.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.720
 And so they make tortillas out of that.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.480
 And again, they had higher...

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.480
 They had very high metabolic rates in the 1930s.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.880
 - And I like the point you illustrate about your research in Native Americans, the West

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.680
 Coast and the East Coast, both using methods to reduce PUFA, right?

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.680
 For their...

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.680
 - Exactly.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:34.000
 So yeah, so East Coast and West Coast, we have first account narratives of Native Americans

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.120
 on the East Coast and the West Coast, both removing...

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.360
 - And what period of history is this?

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.360
 - Acorn oil.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:44.400
 Well, I mean, I don't know the exact dates of those, but this would have been 1700s or

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.400
 17...

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.400
 Yeah, 1700s probably, both of those anecdotes.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:29:00.560
 In the 1930s, George Crile did studies around the world of metabolic rates, actually measuring

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.280
 oxygen consumption and CO2 production.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:17.040
 And he found that the American culture was outstanding in being far below the traditional

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.000
 cultures in metabolic rate.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:30.200
 Many of the so-called relatively undeveloped cultures had a metabolic rate 50% higher than

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.200
 Americans.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:38.680
 In US medicine, that would be considered pathologically hypermetabolic.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.680
 - Right.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:45.440
 - But that was the rate that went with good health traditionally.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.680
 - What was his name?

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.760
 - George W. Crile Sr.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.000
 - Spell his last name.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:02.080
 - He was a famous surgeon and physiologist from 1900 until his death.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.080
 - Right.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.800
 No, I just wanna make sure I have his name right.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.560
 Do you know the spelling of his last name?

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.560
 - C-R-I-L-E.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.560
 - C-R-I-L-E, okay.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:25.960
 No, I mean, that sounds fascinating, but that is very much in line with what we see.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:31.320
 And I talk about a lot of my blog about the history of metabolic rates.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:40.840
 And one of the things that I noticed is in the metabolic community in the 1930s, this

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:45.960
 kind of controversy broke out because someone at a Southern school, and I forget the first

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.720
 one, studied young college women.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:57.600
 And so these early metabolic rate studies had been done in the North primarily in the

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.920
 19-teens, between 1910 and 1920.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.720
 And they had come up with a couple of basic equations to predict your metabolic rate based

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.960
 on your height, weight, gender, and age.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.360
 And so you put those four numbers onto your notebook and you calculate it out, and that

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.080
 tells you what your metabolic rate should be.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:25.040
 And this was very accurate in people from Chicago, in people from New York City.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:30.080
 And then somebody tried it in Oklahoma or in Florida, I can't remember exactly.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.240
 And they found that these young women, young college-age women had a metabolic rate that

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:40.240
 was around 15% lower than these equations suggested that they should.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.200
 So they had this low metabolic rate.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:50.840
 And this was repeated in Florida, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and others.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:56.200
 There was at least, I think, four different schools that tested these equations.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:01.760
 And they said, yes, every time it was like the New Orleans, the young women here have

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.840
 a metabolic rate significantly below what the mainstream equations would predict.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.400
 And then someone in Connecticut redid the experiment again.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:15.040
 And they said, nope, the young women in Connecticut have a metabolic rate that is exactly what

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.120
 the equations would predict.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:22.240
 And they thought it was just that people didn't need to have as high a metabolic rate in warmer

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:26.760
 climates, but then that was pretty much disproven.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.620
 One of the ways they disproved it was by going to check the Mayans.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.400
 That's why they went and looked at the Mayans.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:36.360
 And they were like, well, no, the Mayans actually have a metabolic rate 10% higher than Americans.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:43.120
 But what's interesting is today, if you look at people in Chicago, in New York, they have

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:50.440
 the same metabolic rate as the Southern college women of the '30s who had a metabolic rate

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.800
 15% below the general population.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:59.600
 And so something was causing those women to have a low metabolic rate, and now everyone

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.840
 has a low metabolic rate.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:07.520
 And if you look at the history of oil consumption, well, cottonseed oil was the first oil.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:15.660
 And USDA data from the 1930s will tell you that much more of the cottonseed oil was consumed

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.440
 in the South before it was consumed in the North.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:29.960
 And during this period, thyroid disease, low thyroid function was increasing steadily and

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.080
 rapidly.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:42.200
 And an interesting fact that is seldom discussed is that George Burr himself, the promoter

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:54.560
 of PUFA essentiality, in 1932 or '33 did experiments on his rats showing that when he made them

00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:03.000
 deficient, according to his definition, in unsaturated fats, their metabolic rate was

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.480
 50% higher than what he called normal.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:14.000
 So he was making normal rats and calling them sick.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Interesting.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:24.960
 Yeah, Dr. Peat, I recently took, I actually stumbled across those papers recently and I was looking

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.080
 at them.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:36.000
 And what I was wondering is, it looked to me like the amount of PUFA in those rat diets

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:46.720
 that made them hypermetabolic was almost below the rate that one could get in a normal mixed

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.320
 diet.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.320
 You know what I mean?

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.320
 Yeah.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:35:01.080
 But one person in his lab tried it on himself for six months, the laboratory purification

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:07.960
 to try to create a human version of his rats.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:18.160
 And his PUFA levels did gradually go down and after about four months, all of this man's

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:26.960
 prior symptoms disappeared and didn't recur when he went back to his usual diet.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:36.480
 But all he demonstrated was that doing his best to eliminate PUFA for several months

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.120
 improved his health very noticeably.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.120
 Yeah, that's great.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:50.160
 Brad, you mentioned in, was it the 1930s you looked at the caloric intake?

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.520
 It was like 5,000 calories per person or something that the USDA?

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.520
 So what was that?

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.520
 Right.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:06.600
 So the USDA in the 1939 yearbook of agriculture, which is the yearbook of agriculture is like

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:10.400
 the USDA's big publication for the year.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.000
 And I think it was more important back then than it is now.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.920
 I don't even know if they still do it.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:19.960
 But back then, to be written up in the yearbook of agriculture was a big deal.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:25.600
 And so this is the USDA's really flagship publication from back then in the 1939.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.240
 And every year it's about a different topic.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.400
 So one year it might be about soil.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.880
 The next year it's about, you know, this one was called food and life.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:41.640
 And so they reported on American diets.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:47.800
 And the USDA publications are very much about economics, right?

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:55.560
 They're not about, so the point of the study was not really about nutrition.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:07.960
 It was about how much food different families bought given different income brackets, right?

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.600
 That was really what it was about.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.200
 But then they indexed all of the numbers and saying, okay, well, is this a good diet?

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.360
 You know, is this enough calories?

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.600
 This is enough protein.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:23.520
 And interestingly, in those old USDA publications, there does not seem to be a concept that eating

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.440
 too much is bad.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:33.120
 That concept apparently did not exist yet because there's not even like a hesitation

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:37.200
 where they say, well, maybe you shouldn't eat this much, but here's what these people

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.880
 do.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:45.000
 When you read the prose from back then, it seems like, well, more food is more nutrition

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.400
 is more better.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:53.360
 There's no, you know, they don't, that's just, it's just more is better.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.160
 That's what they thought in the 1930s, right?

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.480
 And so you're like, well, that in and of itself is interesting.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.720
 The fact that they're not saying like, but watch your calories.

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.680
 Like there's none of that language.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.880
 And so, right.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:12.240
 And so what they, an interesting thing about this is in the 1930s, if people could afford

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:17.080
 to buy and eat more food, they did.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:23.600
 And so what you find is that the most, the families who are eating the most were the

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.400
 wealthiest city dwellers basically.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:32.960
 And so, you know, probably the least active people, probably lawyers and doctors, you

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.440
 know, these are not day laborers, right?

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:40.120
 They're not the ones who can afford the most and best food.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:47.800
 And it's all, the numbers are all averaged to what an adult male would eat.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:53.400
 And they don't tell us exactly how they do that math, but you know, by the estimation

00:38:53.400 --> 00:39:01.880
 of the USDA in 1939, the richest East coast cities, the men, the average man would have

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.960
 been consuming something like 4,500 calories.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:10.240
 Apparently on the West coast, the number is like 5,100 calories.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:17.440
 So according to the USDA in the 1939, a wealthy, you know, a doctor living in San Francisco

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:25.640
 or Portland would have been consuming a little over 5,000 calories a day normally.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.760
 That's a man or everybody?

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.920
 That's per adult male.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:34.280
 And so you have to assume that it's going to be less for a woman or for a 12 year old,

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:40.480
 you know, but it's, and they have some, so 4,000 to 5,000 calories a day.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.600
 Absolutely.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.840
 That is what the USDA says.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.640
 Dr. Peat, do you, do you think that is that accurate?

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.640
 Oh yeah.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.880
 What were they eating back then?

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:54.280
 I mean, it's actually quite explicit.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:40:03.720
 It's a, the USDA will tell you it's flour, butter, sugar, potatoes, pork, some beef,

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:11.040
 a lot of dairy, you know, lots of chicken at the time or no, nope, not much chicken.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.760
 Fatty fish, pufa fish, nuts.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.720
 No, no.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.520
 It's it's, you know, it's, it's meat and potatoes and flour and sugar.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.000
 You know, they're eating apple pie, right?

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.200
 They're eating apple pie and they're eating mashed potatoes and they're eating pork chops.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.280
 They were just tearing into that stuff and they didn't have the obesity rates like we

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.280
 do today.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.280
 Huh?

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.280
 Right.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:37.720
 They were eating probably fresh baked bread and, and that, and that's what people ate.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.720
 Was there, was the bread back then not as messed up genetically as the bread we have?

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.720
 Was that a part of the fact?

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:49.360
 Well, it would not yet have been the hybridized wheat that we got coming out of, you know,

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:57.360
 Mexico post 1970, but, but yeah, so it would have been old fashioned varieties of wheat.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.360
 Yes.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.800
 Dr. Peat, should we be eating 5,000 calories a day?

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.800
 Yes.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:09.520
 If you choose your foods the way they used to.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:19.720
 When I worked for the Bureau of Land Management in the 1950s in the woods, we had a cook who

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:32.400
 was at the time in his fifties and had learned cooking in the Navy in the 1930s and 40s.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:46.680
 And our diet was just a tremendous amount of food, all of it tending to be saturated

00:41:46.680 --> 00:42:02.840
 and carbohydrate, lots of steak and ham, eggs, a huge bowl of some breakfast cereal first

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:12.120
 thing in the morning, and then pancakes and ham and eggs as the main course of breakfast.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:25.200
 And all we wanted to pack in a grain bag tied to our belts to eat for lunch.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:36.040
 And then huge dinners, very often a pound of steak as the main course, but with soup

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:52.520
 and cold meats, cheeses, boiled eggs, everything else besides the pound of steak and various

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:55.240
 vegetables for carbohydrates.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:59.240
 And everybody was really lean, I bet, huh?

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.240
 Yeah.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:07.400
 I calculated that I was eating about 9,000 calories a day.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.440
 So now the argument would be, well, back then everybody was exercising way more and we're

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:15.280
 all a bunch of couch potatoes, so that's why we can't eat 5,000 calories a day.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:19.280
 What would you say to that, Dr. Peat?

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:27.800
 My work was just walking through the woods, putting plants on the map.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:36.720
 It wasn't heavy work, just basically walking.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:42.760
 So were you doing any cardio in that job or anything to do 9,000 calories a day and not

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.040
 be overweight or whatever?

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.320
 No, not at all.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:55.600
 I don't think, Dr. Peat, people didn't really do cardio for the sake of doing cardio back

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.160
 then, is that correct?

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.160
 That's been my impression.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.360
 Yeah, I never heard of it back then.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.360
 When did cardio get invented?

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.360
 Like the '70s?

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:11.400
 Yeah, John Kennedy with his touch football and so on.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:22.160
 And Sputnik in the '50s, they did tests and found that Americans, even in their teens,

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.160
 were by far the weakest people in the world.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:36.720
 So as part of the response to Sputnik, the government started promoting various types

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.720
 of exercise.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:45.480
 But then the Kennedys popularized the idea of jogging.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:50.360
 That came on in the '60s.

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.720
 So gentlemen, help me understand something here.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:58.560
 So 1930s, you guys are saying that there's this rise in these low metabolic rates for

00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.560
 women, right?

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:03.720
 And you, Brad, were suggesting that's cottonseed oil doing that?

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.720
 Well, my suggestion is it's cottonseed oil.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:15.120
 But what I can say is that the metabolic rate happening in the 1930s in women is real, and

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.480
 it's captured by at least four different universities.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:25.560
 And then a university in the North redid their study again and said, nope, our metabolic

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:26.960
 rates have not changed.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.720
 There's something different about the metabolic rates in the South.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:35.560
 And I've postulated that this could be due to the rise of cottonseed oil in the South.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.280
 But no one did that experiment.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.960
 We don't know why.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.680
 But it definitely did drop.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:48.720
 So why do we still see-- like, I'm just trying to map this damage.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.080
 I'm trying to investigate this train wreck that happened in the last century.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.960
 I'm like, look-- I mean, as best as I can as an armchair detective here, I'm sitting

00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:01.840
 here and I'm thinking, OK, so you're seeing already in the '30s a drop in metabolic rate,

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.720
 and you're linking that to cottonseed oil or maybe something else.

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.920
 Dr. Peat might have something to suggest there.

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:12.000
 But then what happens-- like, why is it that the famous thing people-- I think it was you

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.520
 or somebody showing photos of people lining up to see Star Wars in the 1970s, and everybody's

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.520
 thin as a rail.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.880
 Was that you that posted those photos or somebody else?

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.320
 Those are not mine, but I know what you mean.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.240
 Parker or Goodrich or somebody posted that.

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:30.200
 And then they show the 2000s, people lining up for Star Wars, and everybody's obese almost.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.560
 And it's like, what was going on that in the '70s-- you're saying the metabolic rates were

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.360
 dropping low in the '30s.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:41.600
 But why do we see-- why does it-- how come it takes to the '70s, '80s, '90s before this

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.040
 explosion in obesity and diabetes and all this other stuff?

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.040
 Or maybe I've got it wrong.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.040
 Can someone help me?

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:59.680
 I think it was the very heavy propaganda starting in the '50s for polyunsaturated fats as more

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:06.280
 than an essential nutrient as a way to protect against heart disease.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.280
 OK.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.280
 Yeah.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:16.800
 I mean, and I think what Dr. Peat means is that if you look at the amount of vegetable

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:25.360
 oil consumption, it was sort of creeping up in the '30s, '40s, '50s.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:36.520
 It didn't really explode until the '60s and '70s even, '80s, '90s.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:47.480
 And I think that my suspicion is that for most people, sure, I think this is a long-term

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:48.480
 process.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:56.720
 I think where you start to ingest too much PUFA, your metabolic rate probably dips.

00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:02.720
 For a lot of people, that might-- the fact that you're not burning fuel as fast, that

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:09.720
 might mean your appetite dips for a while, and you maybe might-- it seems like people

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.440
 at a certain age, their weight gets set.

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:18.040
 And then I feel like you start to see the obesity oftentimes in the next generation.

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:21.600
 And I'm not sure exactly what-- I don't understand exactly what drives that.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.600
 I'm not trying to pretend that I understand it.

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:29.780
 But I think that the polyunsaturated fats are much more damaging to kids.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:34.560
 And I think that you see every generation, you see higher childhood obesity.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:43.400
 And then once you're obese in childhood, you're going to probably fight obesity for your life.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.600
 That's a genetic switch that turns on or something?

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.920
 No, I don't believe it's a genetic switch.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:56.800
 I just believe that in a growing child before your metabolism is set and your adipose tissue

00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:04.200
 has matured and there's a lot of things as you grow that gets-- a child is very plastic

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.080
 and can adapt to a lot of situations.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.160
 And at some point, you are set the way that you are.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.960
 And it's not to say that you can't change these things.

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:20.040
 But personally, I see obesity as something that often happens in your youth, very young.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:26.200
 I was obese by the time that I was in first grade.

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.000
 There's no reason for that.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:35.640
 I wasn't out at the all-you-can-eat buffet all night.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.640
 I was an active kid.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.640
 I was running around.

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.480
 Were you eating 9,000 calories a day like Dr. Peat?

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:40.800
 Well, not in kindergarten.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.800
 And that's the thing.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.800
 I wasn't.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:43.880
 I wasn't eating that much.

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:48.800
 My mom was very-- my mom didn't buy us-- we didn't get bacon.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.040
 My mom thought that was bad.

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.240
 It was too high in fat.

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.240
 We didn't get that.

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.120
 We didn't have-- we did have margarine, though.

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.960
 We did not have butter because butter was bad.

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:56.960
 That was bad.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.200
 We had margarine.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.680
 And so despite the fact that everything in our house was low-fat, and it was lean, and

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.400
 it was low-calorie, and it was-- we had skim milk.

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.400
 We had skim milk.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.720
 We had all the things that we were supposed to have.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:13.360
 And yet, by kindergarten, I was chubby.

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:19.320
 And so my mom was doing everything right, except that the only cooking oils we had,

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:24.520
 which we used judiciously, were vegetable oil-based.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.880
 We had margarine on our toast.

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:32.840
 But we weren't-- my mom was very careful about feeding us things that she thought would make

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.840
 us fat.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.980
 That was-- we didn't have soda in the house.

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:42.440
 My mom tried to do everything she could to avoid that for us, but yet it didn't work.

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:48.960
 And my parents both struggled with their weight, and all of us kids, to one degree or another,

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:49.960
 struggled with our weight.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:55.000
 And so you can see that it starts very young, and it's not-- you can do all of the right

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.480
 things, and it still happens-- the right things, and it still happens.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.200
 We know that.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.480
 And so I-- yeah.

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:09.280
 And so that's where I think it does-- I think there is sort of a generational knowledge,

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:15.560
 or it's just that children are very apt to the particular damages as you're growing if

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.360
 there's too much pufa around.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.880
 Dr. Peat, any thoughts on that?

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.880
 Yeah.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:30.480
 I think it's all epigenetic, induced by the environment.

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:42.720
 And the real problem is that we don't have any science left-- science in the abstract

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.120
 sense of objectivity.

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:53.480
 What we have is industry-guided propaganda research.

00:51:53.480 --> 00:52:05.840
 The nutritional so-called science is under the heavy dominating influence of the food

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:06.840
 industry.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:12.480
 Dr. Peat, do you think that they know that their stuff is that bad, or they just choose

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.600
 to ignore the science that suggests their products, these pufa products, are bad, these

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.400
 high-pufa oils?

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:25.200
 It's bad for their business to do actual science.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:34.160
 They choose what gets published and what gets taught in the universities.

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:40.080
 I forget exactly what year it was-- sometime in the late '80s, I think.

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:49.400
 I had been traveling around giving talks on the dangers of pufa.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:58.400
 And on one trip, I had talks scheduled up and down the West Coast.

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:06.000
 And on that trip, every time I would get to a site, it would mysteriously be locked up.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:16.840
 And if we held the talk, it would be at someone's house locally.

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:26.760
 When I got to the last stop, I found that not only the auditorium was locked up, none

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:33.960
 of the publicity had been done, and the person who had scheduled my talk had been fired.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:42.040
 Just 100% intervention, mysteriously.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:50.360
 Some outside influence caused all of these sites to close up and pretend that nothing

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.760
 had been scheduled.

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.760
 When was this?

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:59.780
 I forget the year, but probably '86 or '88, around then.

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:04.560
 How many people were like you talking about seed oils in universities and the dangers

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:05.560
 of high pufa?

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:08.360
 Is that what you were talking about, I'm assuming?

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.360
 Yeah.

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:13.400
 And I didn't know anyone else who was doing it.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.400
 You didn't know anyone?

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.960
 There's no academician or anybody that was talking or lecturing publicly?

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:18.960
 No.

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:23.000
 You've been a voice in the wilderness here for a while, huh?

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 That's pretty--

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000
 Yeah.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:36.580
 In doing my dissertation research, I came across the history of age pigment and what

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:40.800
 the factors are that cause that.

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:53.140
 The polyunsaturated fats and respiratory stress caused by such things as estrogen dominance

00:54:53.140 --> 00:55:03.420
 led to the formation of age pigment, which is an alternative electron acceptor, a last

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:15.820
 ditch effort of the stressed organism to consume electrons so that life could continue.

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:31.380
 And in the process, that abnormal consumption of electrons has its own effects, intensifying

00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:38.580
 the effects of stress, estrogen, and damage to the mitochondria.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:47.740
 But the role of pufa that I ran across in trying to understand the effect of reproductive

00:55:47.740 --> 00:56:02.700
 aging, that was the core of my subsequent thought giving importance to the dangers of

00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:03.700
 pufa.

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:07.380
 So is that what you were talking about in those lectures that were being mysteriously

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:09.420
 canceled when you would show up?

00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.580
 Yeah.

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:15.020
 Were they all fired or just one gentleman was fired, you said?

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:23.740
 The only one that I inquired about was a person I had known, and it was caused by the fact

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:27.620
 that he had scheduled my lecture.

00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:32.040
 Did any of your work in the '80s or '90s hit the popular press at all in any local

00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.420
 newspapers or anything?

00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:37.260
 Was it creating buzz back then?

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:42.860
 No, I don't know of any reporting about it.

00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:46.340
 So what do you—I'm just curious, I don't want to go off too—but I just got to ask

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:49.300
 you, what do you think about all this newfound interest in seed oils?

00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:52.580
 I mean, you've been out there talking about them as a lonely voice.

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:57.500
 That must be maddening when nobody else seems to pay attention or listen to what you're

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:02.460
 saying decade and decade, and then now all of a sudden, because of the internet and things

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:07.740
 going on, there's this newfound explosion of people talking about seed oils and how

00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:10.060
 toxic and damaging they are to our health.

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:12.700
 How does that make you—what do you think of that?

00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:16.100
 Oh, I'm glad it's finally happening.

00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:22.180
 Did you think it would happen sooner?

00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:30.540
 I did my best to try to get people thinking about it.

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:34.740
 Do you feel that the corporate forces are going to continually suppress this information

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:37.820
 from being popularly reported on?

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:44.020
 Yeah, it's exactly the same thing throughout the culture.

00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:54.580
 The giant corporations have taken over everything, and if the people don't get wise, the whole

00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:59.580
 system is in the process of dying and killing itself.

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:00.580
 Yeah, it's true.

00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:05.500
 Dr. Peat, I wanted to ask you if we could do a thought experiment for a moment.

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:10.380
 Supposing that we eliminated all the seed oils over the last—the 20th century, but

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:15.180
 everybody was still eating the same amounts of nuts and high pufa fish and high pufa

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:20.780
 chicken and pork, would we have seen similar explosions in the rate of obesity?

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:26.140
 Or I mean, is it really the seed oils driving the obesity explosion, or is it actually the

00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:29.540
 other high pufa natural products or relatively natural?

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:34.460
 I guess it's kind of debatable whether the amount of pufa and chicken fat and pork fat,

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:39.380
 as Brad could attest, maybe that's not so natural, but would it still result in a similar

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:42.380
 explosion in obesity and other issues?

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:48.980
 Chicken and pork fat has changed radically over the decades.

00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:58.580
 In the—roughly every 15 or 20 years, the government has revised downward the amount

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:05.860
 of cholesterol in an egg, going back about 60 years.

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:14.620
 And every time they examine the average commercial egg, they find that the cholesterol is much

00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:26.380
 lower than they thought, and it's the shift of the chicken's diet causing the defective

00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:31.220
 egg production loaded up with pufa, deficient in cholesterol.

00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:38.340
 But do you think—I guess what I'm saying is, how much of a role would—if people didn't

00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:46.260
 eat seed oils, but they ate the same amount of high pufa fish, high pufa nuts, would

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:49.220
 we still have the same rates of obesity or would it be cut in half?

00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:52.900
 I'm just speculating here out loud here.

00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:55.300
 Yeah.

00:59:55.300 --> 01:00:07.500
 You wouldn't naturally choose that much fish and fat chicken and pork and so on as you

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:13.180
 can get in the bottled seed oils.

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:23.460
 But still, those changes are industry promoted and damaging the population.

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:27.700
 So just—and Brad, maybe you can help me understand this, or both of you, because I'm

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:32.260
 trying to see like if we could wave a magic wand, because there's a lot of people getting

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:36.660
 on this no seed oil bandwagon, but I want to know how much of the problem that we're

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:43.900
 identifying here about obesity is triggered by these other high pufa sources like nuts

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:50.620
 and seeds and these fish and these, you know, the chicken and pork, you know?

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:51.620
 Yeah.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:56.380
 People are being propagandized to make those choices that no one would have thought of

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:58.980
 making on their own.

01:00:58.980 --> 01:00:59.980
 Yeah.

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:05.940
 And I see—it's hard to tease out.

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:10.340
 I mean, Ana, you see the broad trends happening, right?

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:14.620
 And you see what happens in lab rats.

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:24.820
 And what I see is that the—well, the triggering event of eating a lot of seed oils, of eating

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:32.940
 a lot of high—yeah, sure, high pufa chicken and pork and other foods is that—and nuts

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:39.180
 is—well, and this is—I don't know if we've actually got there yet, but the initial

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:42.740
 proposition I think of this talk was to talk about reductive stress.

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:50.900
 And what I see is all of those foods are essentially leading us to a place of what I would call

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:59.100
 reductive stress, which I'm defining as basically lack of NAD+ or not enough NAD+.

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:09.540
 And that is really—that place is where what is driving the obesity epidemic is essentially

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:11.620
 this kind of reductive stress that we're all in.

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:20.100
 And I think that the things that have really sparked this problem of reductive stress are

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.500
 definitely the seed oils.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:29.100
 It's hard for me to say exactly the proportion of that came from high pufa chicken versus

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:34.560
 seed oils, but mostly—I mean, when you look at how much seed oil is in everything,

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:37.380
 it feels like that is the primary culprit.

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.500
 Maybe it's 70% or 60% and the other things are 40%.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.220
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: That's what I'm trying to get at just a ballpark image for

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.020
 me because there's a lot of—

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:52.340
 Dr. Ryan Seilhamer: I mean, Tucker—Tucker Goodrich has a citation that he's posted

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:59.260
 in his Twitter feed and it says like, "Top sources of PUFA in the American diet" and

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:04.460
 I'm doing this from memory but I think the number one source is chicken and number two

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:11.420
 is like another one that I wouldn't have predicted which is like—like dairy-based—or sorry,

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:12.420
 grain-based desserts.

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:19.100
 So, things like cake and—and—and cookies and things like that which, you know, I would

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:24.300
 have guessed French fries and potato chips number one and I would have guessed salad

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:29.060
 number two because everybody puts, you know, Kraft dressing made of soybean oil on their

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.060
 salad.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:35.260
 But according to that, it's number one is actually poultry and number two is like cake

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.260
 which I neither—

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:37.700
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: You're saying fried poultry or—

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:38.700
 Dr. Ryan Seilhamer: Yeah.

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.700
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: —just any poultry.

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.700
 Dr. Ryan Seilhamer: Well, it doesn't say.

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.180
 Yeah, it might be buffalo wings, you know, fried in soybean oil.

01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:46.420
 So I don't—I don't know.

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:47.420
 But yeah.

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:56.060
 It's just that chickens themselves are toxic because of their artificial seed oil diet.

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:58.580
 They are sources of seed oil.

01:03:58.580 --> 01:03:59.580
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: They are.

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:00.580
 Absolutely, they are.

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:03.100
 So you avoid chicken altogether, Dr. Peat?

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:04.900
 Or at least fatty chicken?

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:05.900
 Chicken fat?

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:14.100
 Dr. Ryan Seilhamer: Basically, limiting it to occasional chicken wings deep-fried in

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:21.460
 coconut oil to exchange as much fat as possible for coconut oil.

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:25.020
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Uhm—so I want to get—

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:30.300
 Dr. Ryan Seilhamer: I just want to put a quick plug in for Buffalo, New York, home of the

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.300
 buffalo wing.

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.300
 Anyway, sorry.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.300
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Is that where you reside?

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:34.300
 I know you're up there somewhere.

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.020
 Dr. Ryan Seilhamer: I'm in upstate New York.

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:41.380
 I really am in the Finger Lakes near—in Shermansburg near Ithaca but I also spend

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:42.380
 a lot of time in Buffalo, so.

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:45.860
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: And we've got Dr. Peat, you're in Oregon, right sir?

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:46.860
 Dr. Ryan Seilhamer: Yeah.

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:50.180
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: So it's interesting just like the Indians, the East Coast and

01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:54.020
 the West Coast both independently discovered that PUFA was toxic and high.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.020
 It's interesting.

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.260
 You guys didn't even know each other's work and you came to the same conclusion.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:05.380
 So I want to hone in on the topic like Brad suggested about reductive stress in our obesity

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.380
 panel which you both were a part of.

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:14.420
 I saw Brad, you were smiling, you know, very happily when you heard Dr. Peat reference

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:15.540
 reductive stress.

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:22.340
 So I want you guys to unleash but try as best as you can to make this accessible for people

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:24.820
 who are a little new but don't let it hold you back too much.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.460
 Go try to find the balance there.

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:27.460
 Dr. Ryan Seilhamer: Sure.

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.420
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Explain what is this reductive stress and how is this connected

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:33.380
 to PUFA and how is this causing obesity?

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:44.940
 Dr. Ryan Seilhamer: Sure.

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:56.700
 I'll explain it to you.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.760
 you
