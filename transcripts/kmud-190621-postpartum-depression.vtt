WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Well here we are again, June the 21st, 2019, another solstice.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.360
 I think for some reason probably the third Friday of the month helps, but it seems to

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.280
 have been on quite a few solstice Fridays in the last 14 or 15 years.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.720
 Anyway, yeah, happy solstice to all you out there, longest day of the year, and things

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.400
 are getting warmer and warmer even though the days are going to get shorter and shorter

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.720
 from here on in and hopefully the imminent threat of war with the Middle East is not

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.720
 going to materialize any time in the foreseeable future, folks, so we can enjoy our lives and

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.920
 raise our children and try and live in peace.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.760
 All right, so this is Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.280
 The third Friday of every month from 7 to 8 p.m. this show runs.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.800
 It's a live show, folks, and so from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.840
 are invited, welcome, to call in, hopefully with questions related to this month's topic

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:06.840
 or a random loose topic around postpartum depression, steroid hormones, new drugs with

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.280
 dangerous consequences, and all the other fun stuff that we bring up to light, and as

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.880
 always Dr. Peat's going to bring his science-based wisdom to bear in on these subjects.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.340
 So from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with questions

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.320
 either related or unrelated to that subject matter that I spoke of, and then, yeah, we're

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.720
 always very pleased to get people from all over the world.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.920
 It's kind of a fun thing when people call in from Australia or they call in from, you

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.960
 know, somewhere in England or wherever.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.160
 Anyway, the number here, if you'd like to call in from 7.30 on to pose any questions

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:54.780
 you have to Dr. Peat or myself, the number is area code 707-923-3911, and I can be reached

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.480
 at the end of the show or through business hours, Monday through Friday, or any time

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.840
 on the web either at the 888 number which is WBMERB, so 1-888-WBMERB, or you can email

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.820
 me, Andrew@westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.760
 So once again we're very pleased to have Dr. Peat on the radio show.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.760
 Are you there, Dr. Peat?

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.760
 Yeah.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.060
 Okay, thanks so much for giving your time as you've done for many years now on this

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.940
 show and we really do appreciate it.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:31.260
 Okay, so your latest newsletter on postpartum depression, brain aging, and reductionism

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.880
 continues along those lines and topics of the ongoing reductionism in science and how

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.900
 short-sighted that science is and linked to aging and the disease that some of these drugs

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.780
 are now causing that we'll get into later on with the obesity and Alzheimer's and diabetes

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.780
 epidemic.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.700
 So for those people perhaps who've never listened to the show before or maybe even haven't heard

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.740
 your name, would you just outline your scientific and academic background for us before we start?

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.640
 After teaching a variety of subjects including linguistics and literature, I decided to go

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:22.640
 to graduate school in biology and got my PhD in 1972 and have been continuing to study

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.240
 mostly physiology and stress and aging since then.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.840
 Okay, and if people aren't aware of also you've spent a long time and you still do spend a

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.360
 lot of time emailing people about health-related issues and that's pretty much what you've

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.000
 been working on for the last 40 years or so since you graduated.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.400
 Yeah, okay, good.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.600
 So after looking at your newsletter and formulating some questions for you based on it, I just

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:01.280
 wanted to get a little bit of your inside thought processes here when you've claimed

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.440
 or made the statements that you make.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.880
 I think it's hard for sometimes for people to understand the things that you say because

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.960
 it's sometimes seems so counter, well not sometimes but quite often it's fairly counter

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.160
 intuitive to all the brainwashing that we get daily from books, magazines, TV, adverts,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160
 etc.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.720
 And as the world becomes more homogenous and the internet links people more fluidly into

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.880
 this kind of cohesive organism, as you've always said, you know, William Blake's quoted

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.360
 that a lie travels around the world quicker than truth can get bootstraps on.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:45.600
 But I wanted to just talk briefly about the product that has just been given FDA approval

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:53.160
 this month called Zoreso, also known as Brexanilone or also known as allopregnanolone which we've

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.680
 mentioned in the past.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.320
 So naturally occurring metabolite of naturally produced progesterone but it's been used and

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.200
 given approval as an injection, given over a 60-hour infusion in hospital to treat postpartum

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.800
 depression and it costs $34,000.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.160
 Okay so why not simply use a $30 bottle of progesterone or pregnenolone, both of which

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.360
 quickly convert in the body to allopregnanolone and don't require extortionate hospitalization

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.720
 and drug costs further skyrocketing health insurance costs and drug manufacturer profits.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.680
 What's your take on the reason that this drug has been given?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.960
 Now I guess firstly FDA approval for this condition which I'd like you to outline and

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.640
 I'm sure you will as the questions go on here in terms of the treatment of postpartum depression

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.880
 or why it occurs in the first place because I know you definitely have your own opinions

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.000
 for that.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:04.060
 But why allopregnanolone and then why an infusion and now they're patenting previously what

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.240
 would have been classed as a natural product that women naturally produce and is naturally

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.440
 converted to this substance as a byproduct of metabolism?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:23.720
 If it was an actual therapy it would be cheap and not patented and no one would make or

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.720
 hope to make several billion dollars a year from selling it.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.960
 For the last 10 or 15 years the FDA has acted as though it's in the business of creating

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.960
 monopolies.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:46.600
 They did it with the sedative or semi-anesthetic drug oxybate several years ago and it went

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:54.320
 from costing a few dollars for a bottle of it to thousands of dollars for a course of

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.320
 treatment.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.280
 Because it's been patented and the company's been allowed to use this as their standard

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.120
 and it's been protected?

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:14.360
 Yes and after that they declared quinine was a new drug and assigned the new drug approval

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.640
 to one company.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:32.080
 And since they depend on fees to approve the drugs a large part of their existence sees

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:39.080
 the money coming in from the drug as sustaining their existence.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:53.280
 If a doctor for example wants to use quinine bark or a natural nutritional substance for

00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:03.880
 a therapy and it happens to compete with one of these new drug assignments it's in effect

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.720
 the doctors attempting to break a monopoly.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:17.240
 And in some situations doctors are actually losing their licenses for using traditional

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:26.600
 medical reasoning and avoiding the so-called evidence-based medicine.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.680
 Which has become very popular as a phrase in the last few years.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:36.400
 I'd never heard of that up until probably 2014 or so when studies would say the evidence-based

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.240
 medicine and things seem to be gearing up to using that as a new paradigm.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:53.320
 What they mean by evidence is a study that cost maybe $150 billion and not just any researcher

00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:04.880
 has that money to test for example a particular nutrient or hormone to treat a disease.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:13.880
 So what constitutes good evidence in this new paradigm is the monopoly paradigm.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:21.120
 It's a study that no one but the giant corporations can afford and so the only drugs that have

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:28.280
 legal approval by the FDA are monopoly drugs.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:36.360
 And the extent to which the state licensing boards are putting pressure on doctors to

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:46.240
 conform and follow guidelines in some situations it's just getting ridiculous that they're

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:53.800
 telling doctors for example not to consider any of the traditional signs of hypothyroidism

00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:03.280
 in treating hypothyroidism but to go only by the TSH to ignore all of the metabolic

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:10.320
 and functional signs that are recognized for 200 years as hypothyroidism.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:19.920
 It's a kind of communism right where there's only one way.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.080
 So it's strictly monopoly capital.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.080
 Maybe totalitarianism.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.080
 Totalitarianism.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.080
 Okay right.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:36.760
 Well communism for the pure definition of the word maybe not but it's very dictatorial.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.120
 Yeah.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.080
 Okay so you can't produce these drugs unless you can afford to play and when you do you

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:50.640
 get the monopoly and the payback keeps the system going and keeps the monopoly going

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.640
 in place.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.400
 But to speak a little bit more about the evidence-based medicine and the kind of destructive nature

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.600
 of it you've mentioned the fact that doctors no longer can use reasoning and their brains

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.640
 and I know them.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.640
 I know some of them for sure.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.640
 I don't know a lot of them but I know some very well-intentioned doctors which are purely

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.160
 altruistic about what they want to do whilst studying medicine and when they're actually

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.040
 consulting with people they really do have a genuine heart for the well-being of the

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.680
 patient you know and quite probably the Hippocratic Oath to exist too in their prescribing.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:29.360
 But in terms of a doctor using their reasoning and this evidence-based medicine paradigm

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:36.360
 being becoming something that is really in a place to inhibit and prohibit and punish

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.600
 reasoning.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.600
 That's very dangerous.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:48.320
 In the newsletter I mentioned the movement to abolish the so-called basic science part

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.680
 of medical education the first two years where they actually study science.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.640
 Just describe that a little too you know just people hear it because most people won't subscribe

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.360
 to a newsletter and they probably won't understand won't hear this so just speak a little bit

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.480
 about that about the person who came up with this ridiculous statement and how what it

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.480
 implies.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:17.960
 Yeah he has written articles pointing out that there have been over 350 reversals of

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:30.680
 traditional medicine done by these big gold standard corporate studies and so he's seeming

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:39.480
 like a progressive constructive person wanting to get truth in the science but he says that

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:47.760
 these big studies are the evidence that we have to take into account and all we need

00:12:47.760 --> 00:13:00.320
 is guidelines what to do how to use these approved well-documented so-called scientific

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:10.200
 treatments and if we have guidelines for all of the diseases how to just follow a chart

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:19.720
 of reasoning laid out by the committees government basically for treating a disease everyone

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:30.000
 will treat the disease in the same way being coming blind to the individual variations

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:41.440
 and their unique history and it's trying to reduce and abstract medicine to the point

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.040
 that no brain is necessary only following guidelines.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:52.160
 Right you probably just need a simple flow chart yes or no if A plus B equals C go to

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.160
 D. Yeah.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160
 Oh my goodness.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:01.760
 And if that's the case then they don't need the first two years of medical school because

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:09.400
 that's where they study the science but the trouble even with that reasoning is that the

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:16.600
 sciences themselves over the last hundred years have been all of the sciences related

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:24.520
 to medicine have been powerfully invaded by the drug companies so that physiology neurology

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:36.860
 and necronology the kidney heart lung brain all of the systems of the body have had their

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:47.560
 understanding shaped by the reductionist ideal that one sickness can be defined for everyone

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:53.880
 and treated with a specific drug.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.680
 Scary well hold on a second there are you listening to Ask Your Ob Doctor on KMED Gallivo

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:05.840
 91.1 FM from 830 sorry from 730 to 8 o'clock the last half hour of the show you're invited

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.360
 to call him with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject based loosely

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:16.960
 on postpartum depression new drugs that are coming out and things pathology surrounding

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:24.960
 pregnancy a number here is 707 707 986 sorry 923 gosh I'm making a few mistakes tonight

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.760
 707 923 3911 I'm just too excited and it is a solstice.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.520
 So doctor giving us your phone number in all fairness.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.760
 I gave you my phone number earlier.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.960
 Alright so Dr. Peat getting back to this new drug that's just been patented it's a metabolite

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:47.200
 of a naturally occurring product called out allopregnalone and given as an infusion cost

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:53.840
 $34,000 reminds me of the Harvoni Solvalde for Hep C treatment which is 90 something

00:15:53.840 --> 00:16:00.520
 thousand and I saw more genetic one I saw one in England it just came out as $234,000

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:07.080
 for the treatment it's a new targeted antibody process where you individually send blood

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:14.960
 blood the patient's blood to a lab in North America they basically just sequence it and

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:21.240
 they target the antibodies that they produce into the cell and send the blood back in the

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.560
 blood then re-infused into the patient and they're saying that they're getting some fairly

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:30.360
 good results for lymphoma but the side effects seem pretty dangerous anyway so I digress

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:36.840
 a little but so far as the allopregnalone and its infusions concerned why wouldn't you

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.480
 know why couldn't you just use pregnenolone as a precursor or progesterone?

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:50.120
 Yeah someone tested that and found that just a tiny dose of oral progesterone 20 milligrams

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:55.400
 tripled the amount of allopregnenolone in the body.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.000
 20 milligrams right.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:05.960
 So there's absolutely no reason not to use orally progesterone or pregnenolone and if

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:12.600
 the sole purpose of treating patients I guess have been pre-identified as having post post

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:18.400
 partum depression because they're still in the hospital in this hospital situation for

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:26.400
 a 60 hour infusion that just seems gosh I don't know it just seems like an expensive

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:34.080
 stay in a very expensive you know hotel it's like a I don't know.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:39.560
 Yeah ordinary reasoning would say that if you want to increase the amount of allopregnenolone

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:45.880
 in the brain why not take 20 milligrams of progesterone.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.960
 So I just don't think for a dollar or so I just don't think enough people know and as

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.380
 time goes on it just gets more and more buried and if we're talking about evidence-based

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:58.920
 medicine becoming this forced new standard and there is only one pathway through from

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.880
 diagnosis to prescription you know it's only something like the internet that's going to

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.360
 keep this evidence or this information alive but I know and I think it's happening more

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.360
 and more as time goes by but when you search for things on Google or other you know search

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.160
 engine I don't recommend Google for a minute but I'm just saying when you search for things

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.880
 a lot of things becoming very difficult to find and I know this happens but I don't want

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.800
 to get off the beaten track with that statement.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:36.320
 So Dr. Peat. One other point is that allopregnenolone is essentially the end of a line of metabolites

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:46.960
 and starting with cholesterol and those are regulated at many steps before they come into

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:55.120
 existence and so when you give the end product without looking at the condition of all of

00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:02.960
 the preceding steps that's a great opportunity for throwing the whole system out of balance

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:13.280
 for example estrogen and aldosterone are other end products of a line of steroid metabolism

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:23.960
 and each of those has a long history in which it turns out that their excess is very dangerous.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:31.400
 I don't know if anything like that will turn out for using the simple allopregnenolone

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.840
 without any of its precursors but it's something they haven't examined.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.680
 Right a little bit too new.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:44.320
 That reminds me and I found a kind of I think there's a reasonably good link here between

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:52.400
 the GABA receptor that valerian a common medicinal abuse for anxiety and insomnia.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.280
 Valerian acts on a GABA receptor in the brain.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:59.360
 The GABA receptors are mediated by chloride ions and they cause inhibition and sedation

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:06.760
 and they calm excitability down so they're anti-excitotoxic.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.880
 So I saw a study here with allopregnenolone and it was actually a fairly old article.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:20.240
 It was a 2006 article from a university in Sweden in Umeå and they noted that the thing

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.240
 was biphasic.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.860
 They were saying and this reminds me like I said of valerian because most people use

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.080
 valerian for insomnia and over excitation.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.080
 It calms people down.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.160
 That's what it's you know that's what it's traditional use has always been for but I've

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.440
 noticed definitely I know other people that practice herbal medicine in England and see

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.040
 a lot of people and use and prescribe valerian have noticed that there is a small subset

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.120
 of the population that actually gets stimulated by it and this article about allopregnenolone

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:54.240
 said the same thing that at certain doses it was excitatory and other doses it had more

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.400
 of a calming stabilizing effect.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:06.760
 Do you that's the sort of thing you risk when you're using an end of line metabolite because

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:13.200
 normally it can never get above a certain level because it has to go through all of

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:22.720
 these stages in which each precursor produces some kind of smaller amount of product and

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:29.640
 so if you artificially have given amount that the body could never experience on its own

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:37.240
 then you're going to for example possibly anesthetize some of the regulatory inhibitory

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:45.400
 nerves and release things that are less sensitive to inhibition.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:52.120
 So what you're doing is risking something that the organism has never experienced before

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.640
 and is unpredictable.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.120
 What I was going to ask you a little bit later on but probably now is a good time to ask

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:05.840
 you the question about postpartum depression for which this drug has been approved and

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:11.880
 your understanding of the cause of postpartum depression how this can be avoided by women

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:18.960
 if they do the right thing because I believe you know it's very treatable.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:29.240
 It happens in women with a history of stress, difficult pregnancy, difficult birth or maybe

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:40.280
 those were routine but maybe there was a history of stress earlier in life and each stage she

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:49.800
 was compensating for but the burden of going through the pregnancy and birth when you're

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:56.360
 building the baby's body and brain if you don't have enough calcium available in your

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:03.120
 diet for example you increase your parathyroid hormone and take calcium out of your bones

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:12.920
 to build the baby's bones and vitamins and hormones are the baby gets priority over some

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:22.120
 of these nutrients and so even in an apparently healthy woman the pregnancy increases the

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:32.880
 risk of a nutritional deficiency and the fact is that the women who suffer postpartum depression

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.000
 have had some kind of a history of preceding stress.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:44.960
 Okay do you think there's any relation to menstrual disorders because I think PMS exactly

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.120
 is closely related to postpartum.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:55.880
 Okay alright so you're listening to Ask Your Ob Doctor, Kami DeGalvo 91.1 FM and from 7.30

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.440
 here in a few moments until the end of the show you're invited to call in the questions

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:07.080
 are related or unrelated to the subject here and it's 707 923 3911.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:16.400
 Okay so I wanted to ask you again about exposure to high levels of estrogen if we would tend

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:22.920
 to posit the suggestion that exposure to very high levels of estrogen being directly responsible

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:28.920
 for the dramatic shrinkage in grey matter of the brain which has been shown which women

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:36.160
 refer to as baby brain in which the MRI studies confirm being analogous to advanced aging.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.680
 Why isn't progesterone supplementation after birth recommended to speed up recovery of

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.800
 the grey matter resolution as it's clearly been shown to reverse the effects and what

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:49.360
 would be a reasonable amount of progesterone postpartum and for how long?

00:24:49.360 --> 00:25:00.440
 In healthy women the progesterone level in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma increases

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:10.160
 considerably during the time when the brain is being repaired after the stress of pregnancy.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:20.480
 But the amount of cholesterol can be determining.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:26.920
 Normally during this time of progesterone increase in a healthy woman after the birth

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:36.040
 cholesterol is well above normal and is the precursor for making the large amount of progesterone.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:43.320
 Women with postpartum depression typically have a reduced level of cholesterol and so

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:49.240
 they just couldn't possibly make enough progesterone if the precursor isn't there.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:55.120
 And vitamin A and thyroid are other limiting factors so even if the cholesterol is there

00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:01.680
 but there's a little thyroid or have a vitamin A deficiency then they won't make the restorative

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.920
 amount of progesterone.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:11.320
 And like that one experiment showed 20 milligrams orally of progesterone is enough to triple

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.600
 the amount of allopregnanolone.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:23.400
 But a normal cycling woman produces about 30 milligrams of progesterone daily in the

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.160
 luteal phase.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:32.480
 So I think that would be a reasonable amount therapeutically in the postpartum time.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:43.680
 But the requirement depends if she's still under stress and producing or not eliminating

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:53.680
 estrogen as well as she should then it might take larger amounts and that depends on things

00:26:53.680 --> 00:27:00.680
 like your thyroid function, cholesterol level, vitamin A and stress hormones.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:13.560
 Okay, I've heard you mentioned in the past hydroxymethylbutyrate as a possible compound

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:21.000
 to improve cholesterol levels but I know you've always mentioned lots of fructose with a healthy

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.360
 liver and thyroid also being responsible for improving cholesterol levels and these specifically

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:34.360
 to enable downstream manufacture of steroid and neuroprotective hormones like progesterone

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.360
 in females etc.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:41.240
 Do you have any other suggestions for increasing, it seems a little odd to ask but for increasing

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.480
 cholesterol levels?

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:51.360
 I think having enough carbohydrate, sugar in the diet is a very important thing.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.600
 Okay, sugar and carbohydrate.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:28:00.440
 Okay, so next question then and I've wondered this, I don't have any evidence for it but

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.360
 I'm going to put it out there and you probably thought about it so I think it's a good point

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.560
 to ask you.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:12.480
 Do you think there is a subset of women who despite the massive rise of progesterone they

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.480
 benefit from during pregnancy are still actually estrogen dominant essentially?

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:27.240
 Oh sure, especially if they have a history of PMS or any kind of biological stress and

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:33.440
 most often it's associated with slightly low thyroid function.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:39.280
 Okay so that can exist, only because I've seen the numbers that they put out there whether

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:45.920
 it's medical publications or alternative but the huge increase in progesterone, you would

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:53.520
 think without way that the rise, because I know it's also a concomitant rise of estrogen

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.320
 but do you have any idea of the proportion?

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:06.840
 About 50 years ago I saw a good chart based on very large number of pregnancies in which

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:14.520
 there was a steady increase of progesterone through the whole pregnancy, just a very steady

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:25.040
 increase at a level I think it was 50 times higher than the estrogen level and charts

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.280
 are very misleading usually.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:37.160
 They often graph them with different axes for estrogen and progesterone so it really

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:51.400
 should show an extremely low line for the estrogen being 50 times lower on the concentration.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:57.120
 Okay but it is still very possible to be estrogen dominant during a pregnancy and regardless

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:02.720
 of the amount of progesterone being secreted which is pretty high.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:12.640
 You have a limited capacity to carry progesterone because of this needing 50 times more than

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:20.960
 estrogen and so if your background estrogen is staying high because of low thyroid function

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:29.200
 or a low B vitamin or low protein intake or something, then it's impossible to produce

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:39.080
 and distribute enough progesterone to offset that falsely high amount of estrogen and so

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:44.640
 no amount of progesterone increase will make that pregnancy healthy.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.680
 It requires getting the estrogen under control with nutrition and good thyroid function.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.200
 Okay, alright well before we take this first call let me just say that from now until the

00:30:54.200 --> 00:31:00.480
 end of the show if you'd like to call in the number is 707-923-3911.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.840
 Let's take this first caller call away from what's your question?

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:12.840
 New York and two questions for Dr. Peat. First I guess you're not a fan of vigorous exercise

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:19.280
 but I've read that as long as you're not running a marathon if you're running for 20 minutes

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:24.160
 or whatever and you're doing sprints that it actually increases CO2.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.080
 You agree with that?

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:31.560
 Because I know nitric oxide and lactic acid are the ones that you want to avoid excess

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.560
 amounts of.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:40.120
 It depends entirely on your physiology especially your thyroid function.

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:50.880
 A person with borderline hypothyroidism will with just the most slight exertion will start

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:58.920
 producing lactic acid which displaces the carbon dioxide.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:07.040
 So if you're really in great condition you can keep your carbon dioxide level up and

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.280
 not produce any lactic acid with a moderate amount of exercise.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:17.600
 Okay so it's not whether or not it's useful or not it's sort of depending on the health

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.360
 of the individual I guess.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.600
 For a healthy person it could be very positive for an unhealthy person it could be very you

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.880
 know add to their problems.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:33.120
 When the lactic acid goes up because you're not using oxygen properly then you release

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:41.560
 first a lot of histamine which produces soreness and maybe asthma and various symptoms and

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:51.160
 then the histamine is causing the blood pressure to go down after the exercise but with greater

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:59.960
 exercise then you release serotonin from the mast cells that could cause a blood pressure

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:05.040
 spike which is much worse than just the histamine effect.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.920
 Okay so just second part of my first question if you take the assumption that people over

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:13.760
 50 are predominantly hypothyroid even if they weren't you know in their earlier years and

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.640
 60 certainly then if people are exercising what are the two things that people should

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.400
 do I've heard one from your talks that if you take you know maybe even just three drops

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:30.120
 of or 60 I use a vitamin E that that would actually be very protective and so the benefits

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.040
 of exercise you know might outweigh the negatives because you're taking precautions prior to

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.040
 the exercise.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.040
 Is that true?

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:46.160
 And a lot of athletes are starting to use baking soda before the stressful exertion

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:52.320
 that provides extra sodium and bicarbonate and CO2.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.000
 Okay so both of those are protective so if you did that and you had a little bit of sugar

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.960
 or whatever or orange juice that would somewhat mitigate the DNA damage or whatever that might

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.960
 occur.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.960
 Yeah.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.800
 Okay second question relates to I don't know if you've heard of this but it's called cat's

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:13.360
 claw and supposedly what it does it's a I think a root bark that ultimately if you boil

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:19.120
 it for 30 minutes and maybe it's like mushrooms where you know there's bad things in them

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.520
 but if you boil it for an hour you know the bad things go away and all the good stuff

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:27.800
 stays but it supposedly repairs DNA and it's been used for like a thousand years by the

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.320
 Aztecs and Incas.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:34.520
 Have you familiar with it at all or do you agree or disagree with it?

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:35.840
 What's the name of it again?

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.840
 Cat's claw bark.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.000
 Cat's claw B-A-T-S and then C-L-A-W.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.600
 I've never studied that.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:52.280
 Okay so you're talking about a product called Uncarrier Tementosa and yeah and they've produced

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:57.280
 it was a big deal for Lyme's disease about four or five years ago.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.720
 They produced or in fact a company called Mediherb in Australia produced a TOA free

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:08.360
 which is the oxyindole alkaloid that was supposedly responsible for you know mitigating the effects

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.360
 of Lyme's.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:18.320
 I'm not too sure of its activity for what you're mentioning but I know it in the context

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:22.160
 of its use in Lyme's disease.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.720
 Okay so there is some benefit to it.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.400
 Well definitely for Lyme's yeah.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:33.040
 The other question I had is you know you talk about vitamin K then there's the vitamin you

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:42.600
 know MK vitamin K2 there's MK4 and MK7 and you know you see MK7 but my understanding

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.760
 sorry there's MK1, MK4 and MK7.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:51.520
 If you're supplementing vitamin K is it appropriate to make sure that you have just MK4 because

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:57.400
 that's the one that is the most important for the...

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:03.840
 If you eat animal liver you're getting the whole variety of them and that's because the

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:13.840
 liver can convert K1 or K2 to the other higher chains and so I think K1 is adequate or K2

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.520
 because our liver can make the others.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.520
 Our own livers?

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.520
 Yeah.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.520
 Oh okay okay.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:28.520
 All right so if I may this is one I so I have a thought if your thyroid is active that means

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.520
 that your adrenals are inactive so I think they work in reverse.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:37.160
 So if you take an example of someone who's always low thyroid and their adrenals are

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:43.880
 very active so that they're generating lots of cortisol throughout their whole life.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:50.720
 Since that's the fight-or-flight response if they train their body to chronically produce

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:58.360
 that cortisol to make up for their chronically low thyroid activity is it conceivable that

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:03.880
 those people because it's fight-or-flight that they if in the absence of some sort of

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:10.600
 crisis that they might actually try to create a crisis to essentially enable them to maintain

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.680
 that that that long cycle?

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.600
 I mean it sounds crazy.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:24.240
 No in the early 60s that was a very common idea among psychologists and psychiatrists

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:34.480
 and I've known people that seem to typify that condition where they know how to create

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.760
 excitement and turmoil.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:42.120
 So you agree with it and then the solution that would be to try to get your thyroid action

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.600
 up is then and to really change the cycle to make sure your thyroid is active with all

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.040
 the ways that you've described.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:55.040
 People who have been creating turmoil just sit around and enjoy and smile.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.880
 Okay all right.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.160
 Thanks very much.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.440
 Yeah I appreciate your call.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.960
 Okay so the number if you're in the area or even out of the area or even on a different

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:11.120
 continent it's 707-923-3911.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:18.400
 Okay so Dr. Peat just moving on a little bit from postpartum depression but still keeping

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:25.040
 the thread of where we're going with the hormones and or the approach to the treatment.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:31.120
 Apart from progesterone supplementation could anything else be done for women who exhibit

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:37.800
 gestational diabetes as a symptom of this kind of energetic defect?

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:44.120
 Yeah I started thinking in relation to the previous question but it isn't just a matter

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:52.160
 of the thyroid and the adrenals but all of the hormones are involved in the energy process

00:38:52.160 --> 00:39:02.240
 and so the importance of sodium and calcium in pregnancy it isn't just for blood volume

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:10.720
 and bone building and such but those are closely involved with thyroid in avoiding the adrenal

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.720
 stress hormone excess and keeping up the energy system.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:24.240
 Okay all right because it seems time and time again the prerequisite here is metabolic energy

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:30.160
 and it's that defect here that's largely in part for causing everything else to fall with

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:37.360
 it and so thyroid hormone and those things that support an active thyroid and the uptake

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.600
 by the cell and all the secretion.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:48.440
 And people who have a history of stress besides all of the essential nutrients, protein and

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:55.400
 vitamins and trace minerals and so on will have an increased requirement for sodium and

00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:01.280
 calcium and the vitamin D to help assimilate the calcium.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:10.320
 Okay I had a question that was written to me about a website this person had visited

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:19.840
 and this person was a doctor, excuse me I think they're a naturopath and it was devoted

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:25.960
 to the idea of chronic vitamin A toxicity as the underlying cause of most conditions

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:31.640
 and I quote the statement there said the basic premise is that many autoimmune diseases are

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:37.840
 caused by being in a chronic state of elevated storage levels of retinol, retinoic acid and

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.440
 possibly the carotenoid vitamin A precursor.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:47.160
 Do you have any comment about this website's author and what was your views on the necessity

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:51.920
 of vitamin A, B and are you aware of toxicity in general with this?

00:40:51.920 --> 00:41:01.520
 It is used to make the steroid hormones all of them from cholesterol.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:08.000
 Thyroid and vitamin A travel together on the protein in the blood, they're so closely associated

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.840
 and they're taken up by the steroid producing cells together.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:18.960
 So you just don't produce steroid hormones for example without vitamin A and it's used

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:26.200
 in protein synthesis making hair and skin and so on will fail if you're deficient in

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:34.160
 vitamin A. Mucus membranes thicken and stop producing mucus with the vitamin A deficiency

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:43.240
 and someone sent me these books by a recent author claiming that there is vitamin A toxicity

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:50.960
 rampant and I looked through it and couldn't find any facts at all.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.280
 All right so you were contacted by somebody who had a similar question about vitamin A

00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:00.520
 toxicity being you know touted as being the causal.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:12.120
 Many years ago some Arctic explorers ate polar bear liver and their skin got inflamed and

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:20.560
 started peeling off and that has been cited in textbooks for I guess 80 years or so as

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:27.320
 proof that vitamin A is toxic but you know polar bears sometimes eat fish that have been

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:36.520
 poisoned by algae and their livers will store that for up to 24 hours at a very toxic level

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:44.480
 and they might have just gotten some fish toxin, algae toxin by way of the fish.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:54.920
 So even that very famous basis for claiming vitamin A toxicity, there's no fact.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:43:02.200
 And when the drug companies were coming out with things like retin-A, there were sudden

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:10.200
 news releases all around the country from medical schools reporting incidents in which

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:16.960
 people for example went blind from taking vitamin A and one of them at University of

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:23.320
 Oregon, I phoned the department and tried to get in contact with the professor who had

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.400
 told that to a newspaper.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:31.760
 I couldn't get any personal verification.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:39.920
 I think they were all just made up with the encouragement of the drug companies to create

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:45.120
 the desire for the safe non-toxic synthetic vitamin A.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.120
 Interesting.

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:52.880
 I just quickly can ask you about vitamin B12 because I wasn't going to as part of the outline

00:43:52.880 --> 00:44:02.080
 I'd produce for the show but given that I do and have seen lab work where people's vitamin

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:08.200
 B12 is outside the range and is pretty high.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:13.680
 It can be produced by bacteria in the intestine and I've seen probably a dozen people with

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:21.120
 extremely high vitamin A or vitamin B12 who weren't eating any source of it but I think

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:27.160
 it must be coming from overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine.

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:35.080
 Years ago, I knew a guy who was very sick, a vegetarian and he showed me his blood test

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:46.720
 had extremely high carotene and extremely low vitamin A and knowing that vitamin B12

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:54.320
 is used in converting carotene to vitamin A, he suggested that he eat some vitamin B12.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:45:01.320
 Within just a few days, vitamin A was up to normal, the carotene had gone down and all

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.320
 his symptoms had disappeared.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.320
 Okay.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.320
 All right.

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:09.920
 So you're listening to Ask Your Doctor, KMEDGalvan 91.1 FM.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.240
 From now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.840
 The number is 707-923-3911.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.840
 Okay.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.800
 We'll carry on here with the other questions that I've got for you on the light flashing.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.520
 I was wondering if people, everybody's out for the solstice to celebrate and that they're

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.040
 going to hear this later on in the archives.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:33.520
 I regularly get people emailing me, they've listened to the show on the archive and they

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:37.200
 ask questions, you know, then and then on the emails but I was wondering, the phone's

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.200
 ringing and let's take this next caller.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.360
 Caller, you're on the air, where are you from?

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.800
 I'm curious.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.520
 I have been hearing from a lot of my football friends lately that there's a product out

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.160
 in Texas called pickle juice.

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.120
 Are you guys familiar with what the...

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.120
 Pickle juice?

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.920
 ... constituents of pickle juice are?

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:54.920
 Hmm.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.880
 Lots of athletes drink pickle juice.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.680
 I drink kimchi juice for the salt to put off cramps.

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.680
 All right.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.680
 Okay.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:03.680
 Do they say what it contains?

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:09.000
 Well, it's astringent, you know, it obviously has pickles that are, you know, molecularized

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 in it.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:16.080
 But, you know, it's something, they claim it's for people who have hangovers and, you

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:21.520
 know, we know that in our little town people have a hell of a hangover and that's why they

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.040
 drink their coffee in the morning.

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.360
 Curious to know if you guys know anything about that.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.960
 You might want to look into that, Dr. Peat.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:34.400
 I would imagine it would contain lactic acid, if it's the true traditional way of making

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.280
 pickles and salt.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:45.720
 And just some salty anything in the morning can be very settling.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.360
 Oh, very good.

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:51.880
 Helps to regulate your blood sugar and lower the stress hormones.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.880
 I did have another question.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.360
 I've contacted you in the past and it was concerning that monk fruit sugar.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:01.240
 Have you done any more research on that by any chance?

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.240
 No.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.240
 Okay.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.240
 Well, I'll tell you, you know, just for the folks out there, pretty soon people are going

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:11.600
 to be able to eat their chocolate candies, won't have any sugar in it, they won't have

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:16.040
 to look over their shoulders apprehensively at their doctors anymore, and they'll be able

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:22.160
 to eat a 36 count box of the monk fruit sugar because it's actually a cure-all in China

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.160
 for diabetes.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.160
 All right.

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:30.960
 We'll keep our ears and eyes open and we'll see where the research comes from and see

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.960
 the published reports.

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:32.960
 We look forward to that.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:33.960
 I appreciate your call.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:34.960
 Thank you.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:35.960
 Thank you.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:42.360
 And I'll just repeat, I had again, I wanted to post another email question to you for

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:46.760
 your response to it because that person was unable to call during the last show.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:54.480
 It was about SLE, systemic lupus arrhythmatosis, typically characterized as an autoimmune disorder

00:47:54.480 --> 00:48:00.760
 and the butterfly rash is something that we were always told when we were doing pathology

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.920
 at school.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:07.200
 And so the butterfly rash, the malar rash was an outward classic sign of it.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:12.920
 What do you know about SLE and what would be your approach to this "autoimmune disease"

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:18.840
 that attacks the joints and the brain, the kidneys and other organs?

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:24.920
 Like the other autoimmune diseases, it's much more common in women than men.

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:31.000
 And animal models can be created with an estrogen excess.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:39.400
 Estrogen activates a whole row of inflammatory processes.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:48.920
 And thyroid and progesterone are things that have been pretty successful.

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:55.280
 Women believed they were going to have to have a kidney transplant or something when

00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:00.480
 they took progesterone and thyroid, found they had no more symptoms.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.600
 So you could definitely see it as an estrogen excess symptom?

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.600
 Yeah.

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:06.600
 Okay, good.

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.880
 All right, well we do have another caller here.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.520
 So caller, let's take this question.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.520
 Where are you from?

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.520
 What's your question?

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.520
 Jersey.

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:15.520
 Question, there's a...

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.520
 New Jersey or Jersey?

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:17.520
 Yeah.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.520
 Okay.

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:28.200
 There's a professor from MIT that's been studying glyphosate and some of the effects.

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.240
 And well, she hasn't done her research on it.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.640
 She seems quite knowledgeable, although she's probably not...

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:36.000
 She's an engineer by training.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.840
 And seems to have an hypothesis that glyphosate is so similar to the glycine molecule that

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:49.400
 it actually can potentially displace glycine, which seems to be similar to the notion that

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:55.640
 fluoride can actually displace iodine because it's so similar, which is obviously troubling

00:49:55.640 --> 00:50:00.760
 for the thyroid, which is probably why they want the water fluoridated to mess people

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.480
 up.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.680
 But do you know anything about how damaging glyphosate is?

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:10.440
 Because I know you've mentioned in the past it's water soluble, but the notion that it

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:14.600
 could replace glycine, that could seem to have more systemic issues.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.600
 What's your thought?

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:25.280
 I think it's very toxic at such small amounts, extremely small amounts.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:32.240
 Interfering with glycine wouldn't do much at that tiny level.

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:41.280
 I think the mechanism is more likely related to DNA regulation.

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.880
 DNA damage?

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.120
 Yeah.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:49.400
 Okay, so one other question relating to green vegetables.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:54.040
 I know you've mentioned that they're a good source of calcium, but they have PUFA in them.

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:59.280
 And just to clarify my understanding, I remember at one point you were saying that if you boil

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:08.200
 them like for an hour that they become, or somehow the PUFA content goes down and they

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.880
 become more of a proper food.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.640
 You can skim it.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.240
 If any fat rises to the surface, you just pour that off.

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:22.480
 Well, actually I wasn't talking about boiling them in water as opposed to actually steaming

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.480
 them.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.120
 Is there a difference there or do you treat that the same?

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:32.280
 Because steaming them, you'd have the water boiling and there'd be nothing to pour off.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:39.120
 I think it's an advantage to be able to pour off any of the fat that rises.

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:43.560
 So you're saying it's better to boil them essentially than to steam them, would be safer?

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:49.800
 And to drink the liquid because the magnesium and calcium, a lot of it goes into the water.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.760
 Oh, you're saying that and don't eat the vegetables?

00:51:52.760 --> 00:52:00.360
 Well, if you need carbohydrate and any protein and such, they do have that value.

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:07.320
 But the important magnesium and calcium, a lot of it goes into the water.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.720
 Oh, I see.

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.680
 And so does the PUFA remain in the leaves even when you're boiling them or does that

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.920
 mitigate itself too?

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.880
 Yeah, a lot of it remains tied into the proteins of the leaf.

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:25.400
 Because when you eat it, your bile salts will cause you to absorb most of the PUFA that

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.480
 is associated with the protein in the leaf.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:32.600
 So you're saying no matter how much you boil it, that's one of the reasons why you don't

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.600
 eat green vegetables?

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.600
 Yeah.

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.600
 Okay, thank you very much.

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.080
 There you go, like it is.

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:42.360
 Okay, so we've got six minutes here.

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.920
 If anybody else wants to call in with a quick question, that's fine.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:48.400
 Otherwise, we'll wrap up with another question, but 707-923-3911.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:56.480
 Dr. Peat, I wanted to ask you about another, you may not have an answer to this, in which

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.960
 case I have one more question for you.

00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:03.820
 But it came out today, I think they patented it and the FDA approved it.

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:13.760
 It's another drug and it's based on melanocortin and it's used for females as a kind of Viagra

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:20.160
 alternative for increasing sexual arousal and appetite, both for men and women.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:23.280
 And it's called Vilezi.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.280
 Do you know anything about it?

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:27.320
 If you don't, it doesn't matter.

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:33.360
 No but the principle, two things stand out.

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:43.480
 The pro-opio melanocortin is the precursor protein for making melanocortin and beta-lipoprotein

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:48.040
 and the endorphins and ACTH.

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:53.960
 And so those are things that come up during the stress reaction.

00:53:53.960 --> 00:54:02.280
 And so the melanocortin and its receptors are normally activated during stress.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:10.680
 And again, if you take one of the end hormone products and take it out of the context of

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:18.440
 the rest of the stress reactions, you're going to have wildly unpredictable effects.

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:23.720
 And the suppression of appetite is one of the things known to be associated with those

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.480
 receptors.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:37.160
 And if a woman is lacking desire for a physical reason rather than just social, there are

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:43.440
 probably serious metabolic problems that are going to be ignored if you just try to push

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:48.400
 up one single mental function.

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:58.400
 And you should be looking at the, for example, the DHEA is a great activator of libido, but

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.480
 it goes down under stress.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:08.280
 When cortisol rises, the cortisol has an anti-libido effect suppressing the effect

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.280
 of DHEA.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:16.640
 So you should be concentrating on lowering the stress and if anything, giving a boost

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:22.920
 to the anti-stress things with pregnenolone, progesterone or DHEA or thyroid.

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:23.920
 Okay.

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.440
 And very quickly for people that are listening out there, don't just use DHEA.

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:31.760
 You've always mentioned that DHEA should be used in conjunction with adequate thyroid,

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:36.440
 otherwise you can turn or convert some of that DHEA into estrogens, correct?

00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.440
 Yeah.

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.440
 Yeah.

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:39.440
 All right.

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:40.440
 Thanks so much for your time, Dr. Peat.

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.120
 It's three minutes to the top of the hour here and I'll let people know how to find

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.120
 you.

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.120
 Okay.

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:45.120
 Thank you.

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.120
 Okay.

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:52.880
 So for people that have listened to the show this evening, Dr. Ray Peat's website is www.raypeat.com.

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.720
 He's got lots of articles that he's written.

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.800
 He produces a newsletter.

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:01.520
 It's fully referenced and keep your eyes and ears out.

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.720
 The show is going to be up on an Instagram page.

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:09.740
 It's going to be dedicated to Dr. Peat, what he actually said, not what unfortunately some

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:16.520
 of the bloggers on the Ray Peat forum are just creating their own imaginations and creating

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:19.160
 a theory from it.

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:25.000
 But just to make sure that people get exactly what's been said, it'll be posted on the internet

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.960
 here or probably three or four months time.

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:34.160
 Busy getting together and collaborating with a very, very kind person who's agreed to type

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:40.080
 up a lot of the stuff and to put it up and I'll be collating it with that person and

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:45.820
 probably in three or four months, we'll have a Instagram page dedicated to Dr. Peat's philosophies.

00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:49.480
 We can be reached Monday through Friday or in fact Monday through Sunday if you just

00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.240
 want to leave a message or you want to write an email.

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:58.400
 It's Andrew@westernbotanicalmedicine.com or 1-888-WBM-ERB.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:02.520
 Thanks for listening and until the third Friday of next month, thanks for joining.

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:04.020
 (laughs)
