00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.200
 Today, we're doing a question and answer show with Ray Peat once again.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.000
 I know a lot of people have been really waiting for the show.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.800
 If you want to learn more about Ray, his website is raypeat.com.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 He's got tons of articles on his site that will probably keep you busy for the next 50 years.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.800
 He's got books that you can actually order.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.200
 You can send in your money in order form and they'll mail them to you.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.800
 And he's got a newsletter as well on his site that's, I think, well worth the money.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.800
 It's very inexpensive of the year and they get mailed directly to your house and they're unbelievable, just packed with information.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.800
 Ray has his PhD in biology from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:08.800
 He's taught at many schools including the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, and a couple of the schools that I can't pronounce in Blake College.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.800
 So if you want to see those other schools, you can check out his website at raypeat.com.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.800
 He started his work with progesterone-related hormones in 1968.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:24.800
 He did a paper on physiology, chemistry, and physics in 1971 and '72 and his dissertation at the University of Oregon in 1972,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:36.800
 outlining his ideas regarding progesterone and the hormones closely related to it as protectors of the body's structure and energy against harmful effects of estrogen, radiation stress, and lack of oxygen.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.800
 So if you want to learn more about Ray, check out his website like I keep saying.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.800
 It's just filled with information. You can learn more about him.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:52.800
 And like I said before we get him on, like I've said a million times, I know from doing the show and our Facebook page and everything, a lot of people have been emailing Ray.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.800
 And he's definitely probably one of the nicest guys and will just keep answering questions.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.800
 It is the holiday season and I'm not saying Ray has asked me to say this because this is 100% on me, but I've said this from day one.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.800
 Whether it's a dollar, five dollars, ten dollars, whatever you feel you can send to say thank you for what he's done for answering the emails,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.800
 that for us would be greatly appreciated because he's donated his time to do this and really help us out.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.800
 So you can just send the money or whatever you want to send to his house.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.800
 It could be a gift, it could be whatever just to say thanks for all the help that he's done for us.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.800
 So let's get Ray on. And I know a lot of people listening in, you're welcome to call in today at 347-426-3546.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.800
 I have tons of questions here on email from callers that have questions about Ray's philosophies, etc.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.800
 But don't be afraid to call in and just realize if you're on hold, be patient and I'll get to you.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.800
 Ray, you on the other line there?

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.800
 Yes.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.800
 All righty. Is there anything else you want to add before we kind of get going?

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.800
 No, that covered everything.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.800
 All right. So I got a lot of questions here and I don't think we'll have time to answer every single one of them

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.800
 because I have probably 50 plus questions.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.800
 But I have been getting a lot of questions from people regarding iron.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.800
 And a lot of people want just kind of a summary, if you can, on your thoughts about iron,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 because you believe it's a heavy metal and it's toxic and it has all these effects on the body.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.800
 So if you could clarify just a little bit for people on your thoughts on the dangers of iron.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:38.800
 Wherever iron gets loose, it is available to react with things like polyunsaturated fats,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.800
 but also protein and nucleic acids and such.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:53.800
 But the reactive form of iron is the reduced ferrous form rather than the fully oxidized ferric.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:05.800
 And that means that if you don't get enough oxygen to your tissues, the iron tends to get reduced by glutathione.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:18.800
 And people talk about oxidative stress, but reductive stress is really what you have to worry about in relation to iron.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:32.800
 Alcohol, for example, interferes with the use of oxygen and causes the reduced glutathione to accumulate,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.800
 to shift the ratio towards reduction.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:47.800
 And that activates iron, reduces it to the reactive ferrous form, and then that causes the damage.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:59.800
 And iron accumulates faster than it should under the influence of estrogen, among other things.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:09.800
 But inability to use oxygen properly intensifies the absorption of iron.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:22.800
 And that seems to be what estrogen is for, to create the illusion of an oxygen deprivation so that you absorb more iron.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:33.800
 A woman, they've tested the absorption percentage of a dose of iron in women versus men.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:39.800
 And women absorbed nine times as much iron as men did.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.800
 That's primarily the influence of estrogen.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:54.800
 And the action of estrogen is to create the need for more iron to carry oxygen in the blood.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:12.800
 But unfortunately, besides making the body absorb it, it also tends to create the conditions that make iron toxic and puts it into the reduced reactive form.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:25.800
 And one of the main things that activated iron attacks and tends to start chain reactions in is the polyunsaturated fatty acid.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:31.800
 And that, too, strongly interacts with estrogen.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:47.800
 If you eat polyunsaturated fats to excess, they will activate the estrogen circulating in your blood, and they will also turn on the enzymes that produce estrogen.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:09:04.800
 And then estrogen, in turn, activates enzymes that desaturate and elongate the existing fatty acids, turning, for example, linoleic acid into arachidonic acid,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:20.800
 which, again, creates a vicious circle in which the estrogen increases the most reactive PUFA, which activate and increase the quantity of estrogen.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:28.800
 And both of those contribute to the activation and intensification of iron toxicity.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:41.800
 So you can break the cycle in different ways, donating blood to get rid of iron or doing things to interrupt the estrogen fatty acid cycle.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:58.800
 Now, with that same question, the person was asking, if you have, based on your lab, well, first off, what would be a normal lab value of iron that you'd want to see?

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.800
 But what if you have low hemoglobin, is it still safe to actually donate blood, or are there alternatives?

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.800
 Would you recommend, like, sipping coffee after a meal or, you know, etc.?

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:22.800
 There's no blood test that I know of that will really say anything meaningful about your status of iron, because the iron tends to hide in your liver and bone marrow.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:34.800
 And the blood tests that people often go by can go in either direction without any relation to the iron stores.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:52.800
 And the fact that when you give someone an iron supplement, it increases their red blood cell count or their hemoglobin doesn't mean they were deficient in iron, because they used to treat anemia with doses of arsenic.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:11:00.800
 The arsenic creates the stress that tells your body you need more iron and more blood.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:09.800
 And so any stress that interferes with oxygen use will make you drive up the blood production system.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:16.800
 Right. And would you say, well, hemoglobin, would that be due to estrogen?

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:41.800
 Yeah, all animals that have estrogen, the female tends to look slightly anemic, because it does something to slow the production of red blood cells, partly lowering the body temperature is one of the actions of estrogen and slowing down thyroid function.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:51.800
 So probably the most common cause of apparent anemia, as Rhoda Barnes pointed out, is hypothyroidism.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:12:16.800
 And I think he was the one that mentioned the experiment in which rats whose tailbones normally don't make red blood cells. In this experiment, they folded the tail back and made a hole in the skin of the abdomen and stitched the tail so it was kept in at core body temperature.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:23.800
 And it quickly began producing red blood cells, just raising the temperature.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:35.800
 And so the first, safest way to treat anemia might be to wear long wool socks to warm the extremities.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:46.800
 Right. Now what is copper's role in regards to iron? I mean, I know copper is important for iron uptake and utilization.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:13:05.800
 Its primary role is in the respiratory enzyme, cytochrome oxidase. That, I think, is probably the reason that copper is essential for constructing the hemoglobin molecule.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:18.800
 Right. So what you're saying, correct me if I'm wrong, that you feel that most people, because we actually can't get rid of it unless you, you know, profusely bleed, actually have higher amounts of iron in our liver and our bone marrow.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.800
 We store it, which in a sense is toxic, and of course along with estrogen makes it more toxic.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:36.800
 So the only, you feel that most people are actually in an iron overload state and they might be showing up low in a lab because they have maybe absorptive issues in their hypothyroidism.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:44.800
 Yeah. In men, it has a direct tendency to accumulate continuously with aging.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:57.800
 Menstruation probably helps women avoid the accumulation until they stop menstruating and then the curve is maybe even steeper than men's.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:16.800
 It builds up by the age of 60 or 70 to pretty much rival men's, but I think the menstruation probably is one of the factors that makes women have a greater longevity.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.800
 Right, right.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:29.800
 There was a study of immigrant fruit pickers, kids in California who didn't get a good diet, but they ate lots of oranges.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:48.800
 And they had on average, I think, a hemoglobin of 10 versus I think below 12 is considered tending towards anemia.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:55.800
 But they found that these kids didn't get infectious diseases like the well-fed city kids who had lots of hemoglobin.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:16.800
 They've seen that same thing in Africa that when they would have campaigns to give iron supplements, lots of people would come down with malaria because iron activates the growth of germs and weakens our immune system.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:25.800
 So one of the tests that's meaningful in the blood but that's seldom done is the iron saturation.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:35.800
 And people tend to be resistant to cancer development if the saturation is somewhat low, like 25%.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.800
 Right, right.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:43.800
 Okay, Stephanie, we've got a couple of callers. I mean, I have tons of questions. Would you like to just keep going or do you mind taking a caller?

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.800
 Anytime.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.800
 Okay. Mr. Chris Dillon from the 908, is that you?

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.800
 That's me. How are you doing, Josh? Dr. Peat?

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.800
 How's it going?

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.800
 Good, brother. How are you doing?

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.800
 Good.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.800
 All right.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.800
 Shoot.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:09.800
 All right. I have actually two separate questions. Dr. Peat, regarding ADD/ADHD and as we've been seeing a rise of these diagnoses in the last couple of decades,

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:16.800
 do you feel that it's really sugar the problem or poly could be more of the polyunsaturated fats?

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:33.800
 I think it's the unsaturated fats. The sugar tends to move everything in the right direction away from brain malfunction.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:46.800
 The polyunsaturated fats interfere with the tension and increase adrenaline and the sympathetic nervous system and the stress hormones.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:17:00.800
 And I think that's probably the main thing, as well as hypothyroidism that keeps the front part of the brain from getting enough energy to focus.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:16.800
 It's funny because you hear people saying sugar is the problem and yet you hear more people saying, let's take omega-3 fatty acids to help with brain development and yet we're seeing an increase in this ADD/ADHD behavior.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.800
 So, thank you for answering that.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.800
 My second question is regarding Hashimoto disease.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:29.800
 Can you explain the proper way for it to be diagnosed because again, I'm getting a lot of people claiming that doctors say they have Hashimoto,

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:39.800
 but I realize that sometimes the antithyroid antibodies that are found in the blood really don't have any relation to the thyroid gland. I wonder if that's true.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:47.800
 Those antibodies interact with cartilage of the joints just about as well as with the cartilage.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:55.800
 So, it's really a connective tissue inflammatory disease which goes with hypothyroidism.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:04.800
 The cartilage is one of the first places that you see hypothyroidism in children.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:22.800
 It accounts for why hypothyroid kids tend to be a knock-kneed and why girls aren't good pitchers often because the cartilage in the knees and the elbows is basically swollen.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.800
 So, I've said basically a lot of people walk around being misdiagnosed for this, right?

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.800
 Yeah.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.800
 Yeah. Okay, great.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.800
 All right. Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peat.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.800
 Josh, I'll give you a call later. Thank you.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.800
 Thanks. Have a good one.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.800
 All right, brother.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:47.800
 Good questions. I was actually thinking I was reading one of your old articles on Hashimoto's and thyroiditis,

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:54.800
 and I found it pretty interesting because you talk about how estrogen is affecting, and correct me if I'm wrong, the colloid,

00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:00.800
 and actually stimulates it but inhibits the exact proteolytic cells to break it down.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:07.800
 And that's why a lot of people are getting diagnosed with Hashimoto's because it's not so much the thyroid itself,

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.800
 it's the altered production of the antibodies because of estrogen.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:20.800
 Yeah, the whole idea of autoimmune disease is, I think, off the mark.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:30.800
 The immune system, I think of as a clean-up the mess system.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:41.800
 The antibodies help the phagocytes remove debris, and if the debris is caused by an infection, they'll get the germs too.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:51.800
 But if the debris is caused by low thyroid causing the connective tissue to swell, the immune system has to come in

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:57.800
 and try to help clean out the junk that builds up because of low thyroid.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.800
 Right, right. All good stuff.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.800
 Now, we've got another call. Do you want to answer some questions or take another caller?

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.800
 Anything.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.800
 Okay.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.800
 Caller from the 678, you're on the air.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.800
 One more time.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:20.800
 Caller from the 678, you're on the air.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.800
 Hi. You there?

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.800
 Hello. Yeah, we're here.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.800
 All right. Yeah.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.800
 First of all, I just want to thank you guys for doing this.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.800
 It's a great resource.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.800
 I have two questions.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:37.800
 One is practical and simple, and that's simply how long would you say it would take someone whose body temperature has

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:46.800
 historically been in the low to mid-97s for that to stabilize if that person doesn't have very much stored fat

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.800
 and kind of institute some of your recommendations, right?

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:59.800
 I've seen a couple of people do it in three or four days, very skinny little people.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:05.800
 Just who had been on a pure soy tofu diet or something.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:12.800
 As soon as they started eating eggs and oranges, they just popped up out of their --

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:21.800
 a couple of people who had been diagnosed as having broken pituitary glands with no function at all,

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:28.800
 all of their pituitary hormones would pop back as soon as they started eating rationally.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.800
 All right. Well, that's encouraging.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:36.800
 My second question is more general and comes from having exhausted your articles on the website

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.800
 and then figuring I might as well look into some of the people you talk about.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:49.800
 I read some of Selye's work, and it seems like he believes that we have an absolute reserve of energy to deal with stress

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:55.800
 and that any stressful event can kind of deplete this and that people start out with different levels.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.800
 I was wondering if, first of all, that's correct, and then second of all, what you think of that.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:13.800
 No, I think where he left it is where the issue of cumulative buildup of iron and PUFA comes in.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:24.800
 Both the long chain polyunsaturated fats and iron accumulate with aging and with stress

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.800
 under the influence of estrogen.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:40.800
 So he just wasn't looking far enough and long enough to see how those factors interacted with stress.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:53.800
 The stress, while he was looking at the adrenal glands and first their adaptive phase and then their exhaustion phase,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:23:03.800
 what happens is during prolonged adaptation, estrogen and other hormones, growth hormone

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:17.800
 and the inflammatory mediators accumulate and estrogen buildup from blocking the actions of the thyroid function,

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:24.800
 the buildup of estrogen begins to directly drive the adrenal gland.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:32.800
 When that reaches a certain point, you can actually get bleeding in the adrenal gland

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:41.800
 and death of the cortical cells in the adrenal under the influence of just an excess of estrogen.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:50.800
 You get the same sort of overdriving from the direct hormonal action of the adrenal glands

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:57.800
 from buildup of iron or serotonin or polyunsaturated fats.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:09.800
 So the systemic effect of stress, I think, is what he neglected to think about

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:16.800
 when he talked about the reserve innate amount of energy that we had.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.800
 All right. Well, thank you very much.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:25.800
 Thanks for calling in.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.800
 Now, I'm not sure. I actually have a question when you're talking about disease

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.800
 and I'm not sure if it's too vague or actually too big of a question.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:39.800
 In one of your old newsletters from 2006, autoimmunity, you talked about, you were talking about Meshnikoff

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.800
 and you talked about how you, I'm not sure if you're talking about you or him,

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:51.800
 argued that inflammation was a pathological reaction rather than being a healthy part of a defensive immune system.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.800
 So, you said...

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.800
 That's mostly me.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.800
 Okay. So you feel that inflammation is actually more of a pathological response

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:07.800
 where most people say inflammation is actually the body's response to helping us get back to homeostasis.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:15.800
 For Meshnikoff, he saw the white blood cells going in and curing the problem, clearing up the mess.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.800
 Right.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:28.800
 But because of the interpretation, he was an embryologist who saw the development

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.800
 through evolution of the meaning of the immune system.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:44.800
 But after the medical establishment took it over, they created the idea of inflammation being the curative process.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:55.800
 But the swelling, the redness, the pain that are the medical view of inflammation,

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.800
 these, I think, are pathological.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:05.800
 The immune system should work like in the prenatal state.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:14.800
 This is analogous to what Meshnikoff was looking at in his solanderates and developing embryos and so on.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:22.800
 In the embryonic and fetal state, injury is corrected without inflammation.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:29.800
 The cells just repair the damage in an efficient way and don't leave a scar.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:39.800
 When you keep the carbon dioxide and sugar where they should be,

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:46.800
 you basically get fetal or embryonic healing without a scar and without inflammation.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:27:01.800
 So I see it as an inability to deliver what's needed to repair the damage that we see as redness, pain, and inflammation.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:07.800
 That makes sense to me. That's a pretty interesting thought there. I like it.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.800
 Now I have a lot of questions on weight loss.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:16.800
 Now I know this for every individual is, there's just so many variables

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.800
 because we don't know people read your articles and they go crazy with dairy.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.800
 They think that everyone should be pumping sugar in their body.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.800
 So there's a lot of different variables going in here.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.800
 But I have a lot of questions about people beginning to follow a lot of your philosophies

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.800
 based off their perception of what they read.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:38.800
 And they've noticed that, you know, their energy goes up and so forth, but they actually gain weight.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.800
 Can you maybe elaborate on maybe some of the scenarios that can actually create this

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.800
 and maybe what they can do to actually halt this?

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:57.800
 Well, gaining weight probably isn't the issue. It's gaining inches and bulging.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.800
 When you're doing everything just right, very likely you'll rebuild muscles

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.800
 that were damaged by stress and poor nutrition.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:16.800
 And as those muscles quickly grow, you should be doing things like feeling your calf muscle,

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:22.800
 seeing how big it is. You can even use calipers on the contracted muscle

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.800
 and see it grow as you're eating right.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:33.800
 But the circumference of your thighs, hips, and belly should be decreasing

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.800
 even though your weight is increasing.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:44.800
 When I experimented first with DHEA, I wasn't expecting anything.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.800
 I was just wondering what it felt like to take a few milligrams of it.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:56.800
 And I noticed after a week or two in the mirror that my waist seemed to be reappearing

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:04.800
 after having been just sort of a straight-sided appearance for previous years.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.800
 And it made me wonder. My pants were getting looser,

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.800
 and so I thought I must be losing weight.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:19.800
 So I checked, but I was exactly the same weight having shrunk around the waist.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:25.800
 And what happened was that I was simply growing more lean tissue

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:36.800
 and burning up some of the fat so that I had more muscles, but was smaller around the waist.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.800
 So initially a lot of people, well, of course, people have to work on

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.800
 what they're eating, their ratios and calories.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.800
 But for a lot of people, and people hate hearing this, but it's actually a sign

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.800
 that your body is actually moving in the right direction and it's actually healing

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.800
 because you're rebuilding.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.800
 Yes, but if someone is putting down fat rather than muscle,

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.800
 their pants are getting too tight, they're just eating probably too much fat

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.800
 or total calories.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:11.800
 Yes, and that's a whole other issue in itself.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:18.800
 I have mentioned that at times I have averaged over the years probably a gallon of milk a day,

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:28.800
 but that's always been 1% milk because even at two quarts of milk a person doesn't want to have

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:34.800
 whole milk at 3% or 4% fat.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.800
 What's interesting is when you say those things, I don't think you realize the repercussion.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.800
 You have all these people walking around trying to drink gallons of milk,

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:48.800
 but they're drinking whole milk and they're like, "Why am I gaining so much weight?"

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.800
 But that's good stuff.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.800
 Another question here, and I kind of have a feeling what you're going to say,

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.800
 but what are your feelings, or maybe talk about aromatase inhibitors.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.800
 What are your feelings of aromatase inhibitors?

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.800
 Because there's a lot of people out there that say take calcium D-glucrate or take DIMM

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:09.800
 or whatever, which we know in a sense is actually from cruciferous vegetables,

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.800
 so that can actually be more toxic to the liver.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:23.800
 Basically, they're usually selling just powdered cabbage leaves and naming it for that,

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:29.800
 but that has been tested and found somewhat estrogenic in itself.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:36.800
 It changes the metabolism of estrogen, but it has an estrogenic effect directly.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:48.800
 The saturated fats, what I was just talking about, the estrogen aromatase activating effect of PUFA,

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.800
 that's antagonized when you shift the balance to saturated fats.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:32:04.800
 And aspirin, by blocking the formation of prostaglandins and reducing inflammation,

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:12.800
 and interrupting the effect of the PUFA, aspirin is a very effective aromatase inhibitor.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:19.800
 But the drug companies don't want people to know that because they charge tens of dollars

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:28.800
 for a pill of their stuff where aspirin costs a penny.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:34.800
 But at the same time, if people just eat a diet that's lower void of unsaturated fats,

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.800
 a diet of saturated fats, eat the right types of carbohydrates and the right amount of protein in itself,

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:45.800
 wouldn't that diet through regulating cellular metabolism actually inhibit aromatase enzymes

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.800
 or downregulate estrogen itself?

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.800
 Yeah. Thyroid inhibits aromatase.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:33:00.800
 The only thing that lowers cortisol inhibits it because cortisol is a major activator.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.800
 Right. Interesting. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of people out there taking those supplements

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:10.800
 and promoting them, and it's pretty interesting because they'd actually be more toxic on the liver.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.800
 In talking about the liver, going back to the iron thing,

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.800
 so if people start to eat this way and really increase their saturated fats,

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.800
 let's say they're taking a thyroid glandular or whatever, is it dangerous?

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.800
 Because you're kind of indirectly detoxing the liver, correct?

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:32.800
 Is it dangerous because it's storing so much iron that it could actually, you know,

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.800
 the new principles, the new diet, whatever, actually backfire?

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:42.800
 No, no. The iron, if it's in the oxidized state, is just sitting there doing no harm.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.800
 Okay.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:51.800
 It forms like little granules and doesn't get out or go anywhere to do anything.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.800
 Right, right. Good.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.800
 Now, going back to the iron things, I know you talked about this in regards to iron,

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:03.800
 but some people want just a summary on coffee because there's so many people out there,

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:08.800
 and of course it comes down to how we use it and when it's being used, what is it being used with,

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.800
 but everyone says, "Well, coffee causes adrenal fatigue," and so forth.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.800
 And you have you, which is probably a 180 of everyone out there,

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.800
 saying that coffee has a lot of benefits because it's pro-thyroid, it's pro-progesterone,

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.800
 it helps with iron absorption, et cetera.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:29.800
 Can you elaborate a little bit more on, you know, why and maybe how to use it?

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:38.800
 Yeah. Do you have any idea of who started the idea of adrenal fatigue?

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:44.800
 I've been trying to find out who is responsible for that word.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.800
 I think it was a little boy in a sandbox. I don't know.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:56.800
 But the coffee contains a lot of good things besides the caffeine.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:03.800
 It's an extremely concentrated source of magnesium and a very good source of niacin

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:11.800
 and some of the other B vitamins, but the caffeine has an antioxidant effect.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:22.800
 As long as you use it with food, it tends to stabilize your blood sugar and reduce inflammation.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:30.800
 Probably its anti-inflammatory effect is the most important thing.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.800
 Now, in regards to how to use it, because there's a lot of people, of course, in America

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.800
 that just chug coffee all day, you know, they go to Starbucks, et cetera.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.800
 And, you know, going back to the adrenal fatigue thing,

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.800
 and I'm not saying I'm not here to prove anyone wrong because I'm just some, you know,

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.800
 little guy in California, but I feel that people took Hanfelia's work

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.800
 and that general adaptation syndrome, those three phases,

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.800
 and they ran with it and came up with adrenal fatigue, in my opinion,

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.800
 because the last stage is exhaustion. So I don't know where it came from.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:06.800
 Exhaustion is where the adrenal gland dies.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.800
 Right. Yeah. Yeah.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.800
 You don't want to get to exhaustion.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.800
 Right.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.800
 But the idea of fatigue seems to be something else.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.800
 Right.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:24.800
 And if you have enough cholesterol and are eating a good diet with vitamin A

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:33.800
 and your thyroid is okay, in proportion to the amount of cholesterol in your blood,

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.800
 you will be able to produce pregnenolone and progesterone,

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:46.800
 which the progesterone in itself has all of the functions of the adrenal hormones

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.800
 for aldosterone and cortisol, for example.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:55.800
 So Hanfelia took out animals' adrenal glands.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.800
 Right.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:02.800
 And if they were pregnant, they didn't have any symptom at all until they gave birth,

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:09.800
 and then they had the usual shock effects.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:16.800
 But that led them to give progesterone to animals that had their adrenal glands removed,

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.800
 and they lived fully normal lifespans, not needing their adrenals at all,

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:26.800
 because progesterone alone covers the spectrum.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:33.800
 And with adequate vitamin A and thyroid especially,

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:39.800
 you will convert cholesterol into pregnenolone and progesterone,

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:46.800
 and the adrenals are very good at repairing themselves.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:56.800
 In some types of experiments, people wanted to have the adrenal medulla removed

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.800
 but have the adrenal gland be able to produce the steroids.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:07.800
 And they would open the capsule and simply scoop out all of the contents

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.800
 and then sew the animal back up.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:19.800
 And within a couple of weeks, the adrenal gland had no medulla or nervous parts left,

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:27.800
 but a whole adrenal cortex was regenerated just from the cells of the capsule.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.800
 Right.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:35.800
 So, like I said before, the repercussions, like aspirin, everyone listening,

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.800
 don't go out and start popping aspirin.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.800
 Same thing with coffee. It's all about how you use it.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.800
 Now, you talk about when you use it or how you use it is very important, correct?

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.800
 Because you, and correct me if I'm wrong,

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:52.800
 sipping it after a meal would be more beneficial with some cream and sweetener

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.800
 because it can help with iron absorption after the meal, etc.,

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.800
 rather than just drinking it on an empty stomach.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:07.800
 Yes, taking it with or after the meal has basically none of the harmful effects.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.800
 I've known several people who said that just a sip of coffee

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.800
 would make them feel shattered and shaky for the rest of the day.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:22.800
 But I told them to put some heavy cream in it and maybe some sugar

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.800
 and take it with each meal, only with each meal.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.800
 Right.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:32.800
 Within three or four days, these people were happy coffee drinkers.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.800
 Yes.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.800
 Most people that drink coffee are pretty happy.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.800
 I actually just got an email from a listener,

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.800
 and I don't know if you've ever heard this, that said,

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:49.800
 "Adrenal fatigue was coined by Dr. Lam or Dr. Wilson."

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:55.800
 I don't know that, but I don't know if that rings a bell.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.800
 Another question is, what do you think about--

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:02.800
 there's a lot of people out there utilizing supplementation, enzymes, etc.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.800
 What are your thoughts on regulating metabolism,

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.800
 using your nutritional philosophy, and utilizing those things?

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.800
 Do you find them to be beneficial,

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:20.800
 or do you feel that it can actually cause more of an increase of endotoxin, etc.?

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.800
 It depends on where the supplements come from.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.800
 Okay.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:35.800
 People with very sensitive digestive systems have to be very careful of any supplement,

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:42.800
 just because the factory it's made in might carelessly introduce things,

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:49.800
 and there might be residue left from the microorganisms that were used in processing it.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.800
 So you have to be really cautious about allergies.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.800
 Right.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.800
 Another big question.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.800
 There's so many people out there--

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.800
 and keep in mind when I bring up this stuff,

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.800
 I'm not here to say anyone's wrong and right.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.800
 I'm just here to bring questions up.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.800
 But there's people like Dr. McCuller, etc.,

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.800
 that are promoting that fructose is death,

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.800
 that fructose causes diabetes, it causes everything.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.800
 And there's a lot of controversy out there,

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.800
 and there's a lot of people that read your article and say,

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.800
 "Well, you kind of promote it in the opposite way."

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.800
 Can you give us--

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.800
 Just a few days ago I heard from someone in New Zealand

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:36.800
 who said he had been diagnosed a few months ago with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.800
 Right.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.800
 And he said he started--

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.800
 I didn't get the details of the whole diet,

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.800
 but it included 300 grams of fructose every day.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:55.800
 And he now has a new diagnosis.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.800
 His liver has no fat problem.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.800
 Huh.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.800
 So everyone out there is saying that fructose by itself causes fatty liver,

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.800
 causes high triglycerides, causes diabetes.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:13.800
 Do you feel that they're missing the boat

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.800
 because it's the unsaturated fats?

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.800
 Yeah.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:26.800
 My article newsletter on the sugar questions two months ago

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:35.800
 goes through the history of how that fructose phobia evolved over the last 50 or 60 years.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:40.800
 And it's very closely connected to the cholesterol doctrine of heart disease

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:45.800
 and the idea of essential fatty acids being essential.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:52.800
 And if essential, then beneficial, and if beneficial, not toxic.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:43:01.800
 And meanwhile, the actual science was going on for basically 80 years

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:09.800
 showing that the essential so-called fatty acids are toxic and carcinogenic.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:19.800
 Just straight-line research that was submerged by the oil industry

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:27.800
 perverting the medical establishment around the cholesterol doctrine of heart disease.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.800
 And Ray brought up his newsletter, guys.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.800
 He said if you want to get it, it's really cheap.

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.800
 And I'm not here to sell them, but they're just an unbelievable pack of information.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:40.800
 And you can go to his website and his store and for 12 issues it's $28.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.800
 $38 out of the country, $48 elsewhere.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.800
 It's actually, you know, it's well worth the money.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.800
 So take a look at it.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.800
 Some other questions for callers.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.800
 This is kind of an interesting question.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.800
 I'll kind of read it to you.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.800
 Because you mentioned that pigs are fed on soybeans or other sources of poof.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:02.800
 Their fat tends to become more unsaturated and therefore unhealthy.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.800
 Barry Grove says the same thing.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:10.800
 However, if their fat was truly unsaturated, how come it's still solid at room temperature?

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.800
 Which fat is that?

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.800
 The unsaturated.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.800
 I don't know which one would be solid at room temperature.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.800
 What kind is that?

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:25.800
 I think they're talking about--I think they're saying, you know, you feed a pig, poof is a soy.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:31.800
 That unsaturated fat technically is liquid at room temperature.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.800
 And they're saying, well, if you take out a piece of bacon, they're associating the fat.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:36.800
 It's actually solid.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:37.800
 It's not liquid.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.800
 Oh, well, it isn't.

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:49.800
 If you extract the fat, when I was a kid, I would get blocks of lard for my grandmother.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.800
 And they were definitely solid at room temperature, just like butter.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:45:06.800
 But the lard that I've seen in recent years, which is now slightly over 30% poof, it's soft at room temperature.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:16.800
 And the fat droplets in bacon naturally are enclosed in cells and connected by connective tissue.

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:26.800
 So even if it was 100% poof, it would still have a white, firm appearance.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.800
 Right, right.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:37.800
 Now, I know you've answered this question before in other shows, but it's on here, and I think a lot of people still have this question because it comes up a lot.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:42.800
 There's so many people out there on like a Sino-Mal or et cetera, T3 medication,

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.800
 and there's a lot of people being sold that Time Release is actually better for them.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:52.800
 They want to know your opinion on Time Release versus just your basic Cytomel.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:57.800
 Is there a difference, and is one better than the other?

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:08.800
 I've heard from several people who were having either overdose effects from the Time Release or no effects,

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:16.800
 and I got some documents from a lawyer who was defending someone,

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:32.800
 and so they had the compounded Time Release T3 analyzed by a couple different laboratories, and no T3 could be found in it.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:44.800
 The T3, if you compound it carelessly, it's very easily destroyed or lost or oxidized or otherwise decomposed,

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:53.800
 and with the wrong Time Release agent that might work for vitamin A or something,

00:46:53.800 --> 00:47:02.800
 it might just permanently bind the T3 or it might release it as soon as it hits your stomach acid.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:09.800
 There just hasn't been good research on how to compound the Time Release T3,

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:20.800
 and even a lot of the generic products that they presumably have imitated Cytomel,

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:27.800
 some of the generic products have very erratic effects.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:36.800
 Generally, I don't think the idea of a patented brand-name medicine is a good idea.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:48.800
 It's usually mostly fakery, but in the case of T3, I haven't seen a good other product.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:53.800
 It's interesting, there's a lot of people out there that get sold that the Time Release is the only way to go.

00:47:53.800 --> 00:48:00.800
 It's just good to know you get options and what's going to be best for that person, but nutrition first if possible.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:10.800
 Another question about the cat seems to always come up, and I think it's a simplistic medicinal food that gets really put into a complex.

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:15.800
 People just are confused on, you talked about how to use it, shredding and etc.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.800
 People, which I find kind of odd because all you have to do is eat one carrot,

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.800
 they're finding it hard to carve out time to eat a carrot alone.

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:26.800
 Do you recommend eating it before a meal, with a meal, after a meal?

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.800
 Is there any difference, or is it really that simple, just eat a carrot a day?

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:42.800
 Usually it's just eating the carrot, but if you're having a problem with low blood sugar or thyroid irregular function,

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:54.800
 if you eat it with a meal, you might slow digestion to the point that you aren't getting your food as expected.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:49:02.800
 So you might feel shaky after eating because you're not absorbing your food or activating your thyroid properly.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:13.800
 But if a person wants to reduce their fat absorption, eating the carrot with the meal will accelerate weight loss.

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:19.800
 You have to fit it in the way that functions best.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:27.800
 One thing to keep in mind is that if your intestine has been sluggish for a long time,

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:36.800
 and you start stimulating it with the raw carrot, you will be changing the rhythm of the peristalsis.

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:44.800
 It takes sometimes a week to set up a new rhythm around a daily carrot.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:51.800
 So you can get some side effects while you're adapting, creating a new bowel rhythm.

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:57.800
 Right. And do you find sometimes that it can actually constipate people?

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:06.800
 Oh, very rarely. One in a thousand or so will react to the carotene.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:12.800
 If you're very low thyroid, if the palms of your hands and calluses are orange,

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:18.800
 then you might want to rinse the carrot after grating it to get some of the carotene out.

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.800
 Right. Yeah, it's good stuff that works.

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:26.800
 And now everyone's going to start eating it with their meal because you said it aids weight loss.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:31.800
 Everyone's going to be going crazy now eating carrots during their meal. It's great.

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.800
 So talking about carbon dioxide, this is huge.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.800
 And I know a lot of times you're talking about it at the cell level.

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.800
 And a lot of people out there, you know, eating, your philosophy,

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:44.800
 the whole goal is to increase carbon dioxide production by the cell.

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:48.800
 A lot of people want to know, besides the nutrition,

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:53.800
 if they're trying to increase their carbon dioxide levels, you know,

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:58.800
 with adding baking soda to, say, orange juice throughout the day, would that actually help?

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.800
 And is that something you recommend?

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:09.800
 Well, some orange juice is so sour that people tolerate it better if they put a pinch of baking soda in it.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:15.800
 The orange juice companies typically add citric acid if they accidentally get ripe oranges

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:22.800
 because people are so accustomed to the acidic tang of orange juice.

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:34.800
 But you tend, if you put it in acid, baking soda is going to bubble off most of the carbon dioxide.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:43.800
 Some will dissolve in the water, and it might increase your systemic CO2 a little bit.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:51.800
 There have been experiments where, like with bicycle racers in Death Valley,

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:56.800
 they had them take a tablespoon of baking soda before the race,

00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:08.800
 and they found that they performed better because of either the increased sodium or the increased CO2.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:15.800
 Now, wouldn't you say that anything you do nutritionally to downregulate serotonin

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:21.800
 would actually upregulate CO2 as well? Is that correct?

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:27.800
 I'm not sure how general that is. Probably. It seems probable.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:32.800
 Okay. Guys, don't forget to call in if you want to call in.

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:38.800
 I'm going to have a ton of questions, but you're welcome to call in, 347-426-3546.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.800
 Next question is about coconut oil.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.800
 If someone doesn't have a gallbladder, is that the best source of fat,

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:51.800
 since most of the medium-chain fatty acids don't need bile to digest?

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.800
 Are there any other good sources?

00:52:53.800 --> 00:53:03.800
 I think just eating things in a mixed form in small amounts is important if you don't have a gallbladder.

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:10.800
 The bile is still going to be there, but it's coming out in dribbles rather than surges.

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.800
 So mixing your fats with your proteins, carbs, in smaller amounts?

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.800
 Yeah.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.800
 Okay. It's pretty simple.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:26.800
 In regards to detoxing from poof, I think in one of your books or articles you talked about,

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:30.800
 I think it takes four years or something like that.

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:35.800
 Yeah, that's some experiments in rats and people.

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:39.800
 They found that it depends on the size of the fat cell,

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:44.800
 depending on that rather than the size of the organism.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:53.800
 It's just a slow process to randomly renew the composition of the fat cells.

00:53:53.800 --> 00:54:00.800
 Right. So this person wants to know, because of starting to eat based on some of your philosophies,

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.800
 they feel that maybe because of the poof of detox,

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:11.800
 they're actually having initially more kind of reactive hypoglycemic reactions,

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.800
 and they feel like they might be getting worse.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:18.800
 Is that because of the poof of detox, and is there any way to make it easier?

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:26.800
 Keeping your blood sugar steady and even adding some saturated fat.

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:31.800
 The saturated fats inhibit the stress hormones,

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:38.800
 which means that they also tend to inhibit release of fat from stores.

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:46.800
 So sugar and saturated fats and niacin and aspirin and various safe nutrients

00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:49.800
 inhibit the release of fat.

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:56.800
 So doing everything you can to keep the fat in place,

00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:03.800
 it isn't going to completely stop the reduction of the fat.

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:08.800
 The fat cells themselves are able to slowly oxidize.

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:15.800
 I think someone calculated that a person could just in their fat cells alone,

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:22.800
 if the fat never leaves, the fat cells will consume about three pounds in a couple of years.

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:32.800
 A very slow reduction, but the minimal release into the bloodstream

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:37.800
 isn't going to cause the stress symptoms if you're having the saturated fats

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.800
 to turn off the stress reactions,

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:47.800
 outweighing the pro-stress effects of the liberated fats.

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:57.800
 What about using foods or topical or powder supplements like vitamin E or niacinamide?

00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:04.800
 Niacinamide is an anti-fat liberating substance.

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.800
 Usually 100 milligrams twice a day is all it takes,

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:15.800
 but it's fairly safe to use larger doses if it's needed.

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:20.800
 Yes. Everyone listening, don't go out there and start popping niacinamide

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.800
 to something that maybe some people might need.

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.800
 So don't start going crazy and buying it.

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:36.800
 One of the ways that the body safely eliminates the stored PUFA is through the liver.

00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:45.800
 The liver recognizes whatever is carried on the albumin as it streams through the liver.

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:55.800
 The albumin binds anything that's fat soluble and carries it to the liver.

00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:03.800
 And the liver, when the albumin arrives carrying either dioxin

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:12.800
 or one of the toxic environmental estrogenic substances,

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:19.800
 the liver will capture it and bind it as it processes it for detox.

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:29.800
 It recognizes the PUFA as toxins and will selectively attach glucuronic acid to them

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:35.800
 just as if it was dioxin and send it to the kidneys for excretion.

00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:40.800
 That's the safe way to get rid of it, let your liver take care of it.

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:44.800
 Good stuff. Good stuff.

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:49.800
 I'm going to buzz this caller in.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:54.800
 Caller from the 386, you're on the air.

00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:00.800
 Caller from the 386, you're on the air.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:08.800
 And we're going to take them off because we can hear ourselves in the background.

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.800
 Guys, when you call in, make sure you're kind of in a quiet spot.

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:15.800
 I can ask you a question and I can kind of hang up on you and let Ray answer it.

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:20.800
 That's fine as well.

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.800
 Question about blood pressure.

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:28.800
 Can high blood pressure be looked at similar to high cholesterol, meaning more stress,

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:32.800
 so it's an adaptation mechanism?

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:44.800
 Yeah, when your body senses that it's not getting enough oxygen or glucose or other essential factor,

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:53.800
 it tells the heart to pump more blood to deliver more oxygen and glucose.

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:57.800
 That's the way it should work.

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:07.800
 When you're loaded with PUFA, they're tending to give chronic signals to the brain that nothing is getting the glucose

00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:17.800
 and oxygen that it needs because, in truth, the PUFA are interfering with the use of glucose and oxygen,

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:28.800
 but the PUFA are also telling the pituitary and the nervous system to crank up the stress signals.

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:34.800
 While we're on the topic of blood pressure, there's a couple questions about salt.

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:39.800
 And I think one of the great articles/newsletter you wrote, if people haven't read it,

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.800
 is about eclampsia in the real organism.

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.800
 It's one of my favorites.

00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:47.800
 It's a work of Tom Brewer, guys.

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:50.800
 I got kind of his name from Dr. Ray Peat.

00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.800
 He's got some great books on pregnancy, eclampsia, toxemia, et cetera.

00:59:54.800 --> 01:00:00.800
 Can you talk a little bit about just the benefits of salt and why it's so important, not only for us,

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.800
 but also pregnant women?

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:14.800
 Well, the eclampsia problem is very closely connected to high PUFA, and that goes with low thyroid.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:24.800
 And low thyroid goes with the low carbon dioxide and poor ability to retain sodium.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:31.800
 And so the sodium is constantly being lost, as well as the magnesium.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:41.800
 And as the sodium is lost, the adrenals try to correct things by increasing aldosterone,

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:52.800
 which does retain sodium, but at the expense of losing magnesium faster.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:57.800
 And if your thyroid is low, you not only lose sodium through the kidneys,

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:01.800
 but your cells can't retain magnesium.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:09.800
 And so on a low sodium intake relative to your hormonal needs,

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:17.800
 what you're doing is turning on a system that makes the problem worse by letting out the magnesium

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:28.800
 that is needed for cell energy and controlling inflammation and tension and cramps and so on.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:38.800
 So if you just increase your sodium intake, you're compensating for a low thyroid function,

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:47.800
 but you're turning off the aldosterone, and getting the aldosterone down directly lowers inflammation

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.800
 and stops some of the magnesium loss.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:02:00.800
 So just by adding sodium as Brewer and the people he based his thinking on,

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:07.800
 they showed that just sodium alone would very commonly cure the whole problem,

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:15.800
 and that seems to be acting by way largely of the aldosterone system.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.800
 Now what does it have to do with albumin?

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:25.800
 Does albumin play into that in regards to regulating water distribution

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.800
 and how albumin is actually affected by estrogen?

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:34.800
 Yeah, estrogen interferes with the liver's synthesis of albumin,

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:44.800
 and the polyunsaturated fats under stress are going to be circulating in the blood,

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.800
 and the albumin is picking them up.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:54.800
 But if you're producing less albumin and having more unsaturated fats,

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.800
 the albumin isn't able to detoxify them very well,

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.800
 but it becomes saturated with unsaturated fats.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:11.800
 And when albumin is loaded with fats, it goes right into cells.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:19.800
 Part of its function is to deliver saturated fats to stress tissues.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:25.800
 So that's part of if your fat is saturated, the albumin has a logical function

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:33.800
 to increase the energy supply during a crisis by taking it right into the heart, for example,

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:39.800
 and saving sugar for the brain to use and so on.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:51.800
 But in the kidneys, this being overloaded with fat happens to make the albumin

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.800
 pass right through the kidneys into the urine,

01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:01.800
 and so you tend to lose albumin as well as sodium

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:07.800
 under the influence of high stress and PUFA.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:14.800
 And it shows up as albumin in the urine when you're under great stress.

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:25.800
 And the albumin, one of its functions is to retain water in association

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:31.800
 with the open protein molecule.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:39.800
 It has sites that associate with sodium, and the sodium associated with water

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:43.800
 is kept in the vicinity of the albumin molecule.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:47.800
 But if you're low in sodium, the albumin can't work,

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:56.800
 and if your albumin is low besides, then you get a double problem of water retention.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:06.800
 So the first thing that happens when you correct your fats and thyroid and estrogen and so on

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:13.800
 is that you let water out of your body while retaining the sodium, magnesium, albumin,

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.800
 and all the stuff you need.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:21.800
 And that's why when women are pregnant, their blood volume goes up so much.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:26.800
 It's because of albumin, and Tom Brewer talks about estrogen lowering that

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.800
 and affecting blood volume and high blood pressure.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.800
 So I guess--

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:34.800
 Yeah, and the fetus and the brain are being deprived of estrogen and sugar,

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:38.800
 and so you get the signals to drive up the blood pressure,

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.800
 but the same thing is causing the blood volume to go down.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:48.800
 So you've got to get the blood volume up, and salt's the quickest way to do that.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.800
 Right.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.800
 We've talked about salt before, so that's great.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.800
 We have a caller, a couple of callers actually.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:58.800
 I'm going to take the caller from the 415.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.800
 Hello?

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.800
 Caller from the 415, you're on--yeah, you're on the air.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:02.800
 Okay.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:07.800
 Yeah, I was just wondering what you think of heavy metal detox as far as if you get your amalgams,

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:13.800
 multiple of them out of your mouth, and the doctor or dentist wants to put you on, like, IV,

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:20.800
 glutathione, or vitamin C drips, or major doses of cilantro or chlorella.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:26.800
 Do you think that's all necessary, or can you get the mercury out of your tissues,

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:32.800
 which seems to be a year if people think it's saturated their tissues?

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:36.800
 Do you think you can get it out on your own, or do you need supplements?

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:40.800
 Hans Selye did experiments with poisoning animals with mercury

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:46.800
 and showed that a given dose would cause death of the kidneys and such,

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:51.800
 but then he gave them the same amount of mercury plus vitamin C,

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.800
 and they had no toxic effects at all.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:07:00.800
 The mercury in its reduced form isn't toxic.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.800
 It's just a metal, but it's like iron.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:09.800
 It depends on the exact state of reduction that makes it stick to things.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:17.800
 Caffeine is associated with getting the heavy metals out of your tissues,

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:21.800
 probably as a sort of chelator,

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:30.800
 but vitamin C from regular foods is an important defense against all of the heavy metals.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:38.800
 But if you take these reducing agents in an unphysiological way,

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.800
 they can activate iron.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.800
 Like I mentioned in the liver,

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:50.800
 alcohol causes the reduction of iron by activating glutathione.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.800
 Glutathione is the agent of making iron toxic.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:04.800
 So if you put glutathione or another reducing agent into the blood in an unphysiological way,

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:08.800
 it can increase the pre-radical damage.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.800
 Oh, great.

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:10.800
 Okay.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.800
 So don't sit there with a drip in your arm.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:13.800
 You don't need it.

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.800
 I don't think so.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.800
 Okay.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.800
 All right.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.800
 Thanks.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:19.800
 Thanks for calling in.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.800
 Sure.

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:23.800
 We've got another call.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:28.800
 I'm going to take them to spend a whole for about 10 minutes.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.800
 Caller from 386, you're on the air.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.800
 Yes, this is Debbie,

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:37.800
 and I am calling from the Bray-Peat fans on Facebook with a very basic question

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:41.800
 that's been on a running thread of ours for the last couple of days.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.800
 Hi, Debbie.

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.800
 Hi.

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:50.800
 We want to know if there's a reason or an advantage to shredding the carrot.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:57.800
 Oh, there have been experiments with the length of the fiber.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:05.800
 And, for example, they experimented with different ways of milling bran,

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:14.800
 and the one that was called B-Wing bran had about 10 times better function in the

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.800
 intestine than the ordinary way of grinding it to a dust.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:23.800
 And it's the same if you put a carrot in a blender.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:29.800
 You're destroying a lot of the water-retaining function of the fibers.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:33.800
 Well, what about as opposed to eating the carrot whole?

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:40.800
 Yeah, your teeth leave large sections of the fiber intact.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.800
 So we should shred the carrot?

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.800
 Or chew it.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:47.800
 Just chewing it is very good.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.800
 Okay.

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.800
 That is what we needed to know.

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:51.800
 Thank you so much.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.800
 It's a real privilege to be listening to you today, Dr. Peat.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.800
 Thank you so much.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.800
 Thanks for calling in.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.800
 Thank you.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.800
 Good questions.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.800
 I got tons of questions, and this is kind of a general question,

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.800
 and if you don't want to answer it, you don't have to.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.800
 A lot of people want to know if you're familiar with Weston A. Price's work.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.800
 Oh, yeah.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.800
 Of course.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.800
 And they want to know your thoughts on it.

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:31.800
 Oh, he saw that traditional diets produced good tooth development, generally,

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.800
 and bone development.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.800
 So his work was basically very good,

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:47.800
 seeing that you can eat a lot of traditional diets and be healthy.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.800
 Okay.

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.800
 That was simple.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.800
 Another question is regarding fertility, but not female fertility.

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.800
 We're going to talk about the men.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:02.800
 If someone has, let's say, low sperm count or quality,

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.800
 could you talk about maybe some reasons for that,

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:09.800
 and what could they actually maybe change in their diet to actually help increase that

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.800
 or alleviate it?

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:17.800
 Low thyroid is probably the main cause of both male and female infertility,

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:21.800
 and already in the 1940s,

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:30.800
 people saw that pregnenolone alone by itself was enough to greatly increase sperm quality.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:41.800
 And the polyunsaturated fats, which interfere with the steroid production as well as thyroid function,

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:48.800
 are a major villain in male fertility.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.800
 Interesting.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:53.800
 So just really following consistently a lot of your diet recommendations,

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:58.800
 food, eliminating KUFAs over time will help to increase sperm count

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.800
 and just male fertility just like women.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:01.800
 Yes.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:11.800
 I've seen several people in just, I think, two or three weeks using pregnenolone and thyroid.

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:18.800
 Just the man doing that, the couple got pregnant the very next month.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:19.800
 Okay.

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.800
 Now this question is from Karen MCC.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.800
 She wants to know about sleep.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.800
 She says, "There's a lot of people out there that are following your principles and they feel good,

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:33.800
 but one of the things that is troubling them is sleep.

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:39.800
 They maybe fall asleep and wake up or they have trouble sleep or they wake up and their pulse is super high.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:46.800
 Can you maybe elaborate on why and give us maybe some basic things that people could do to help alleviate that?"

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.800
 Yes.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.800
 Taking too much thyroid too soon can do that.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:13:01.800
 Your liver should store enough glucose or glycogen to let you fast for at least eight hours,

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:06.800
 especially during sleep.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:13.800
 But before the liver has regenerated its ability to store glycogen,

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:23.800
 the thyroid is making your brain and muscles and kidneys need more sugar and oxygen.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:32.800
 And so you have to eat more often until the liver is able to adapt.

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:39.800
 Now let's say someone's eating the principles and not taking a glandular and they consistently have high pulses.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.800
 Now we could say it's adrenaline.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.800
 We could say they're hypothyroid.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:49.800
 Do you feel that if they were to change anything in their diet, it would be the amount of carbs they're taking?

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.800
 They would have to increase their carbs to regulate their blood sugar more?

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.800
 Or would they eat more often?

01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:06.800
 Yes, eating more often and making sure that the fat is just enough to keep you from absorbing your sugar all at once

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:15.800
 and burning it, having some fat with your carbohydrate makes it absorb more slowly.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.800
 So increasing the fat intake.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:27.800
 Yes, sometimes that helps to sleep through the night to have a good amount of fat along with your carbohydrate at bedtime.

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:46.800
 And salt, I've known very young and very old people both with sleep problems who as soon as they tried a very salty snack at bedtime just had perfect sleep.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:53.800
 Salt is very effective at lowering adrenaline.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.800
 Good stuff. We've got another call. I'm going to take this caller.

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.800
 Caller from the 718, you're on the air.

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.800
 Yes, hello?

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.800
 Hello.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.800
 Hello.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:06.800
 You're on the air.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:12.800
 Yes, I have a question. I'll try to make it as brief as possible.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:19.800
 For about a year I was somebody who was like -- at least I perceived it as being very sugar intolerant.

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:27.800
 And every time I tried taking it, it would just -- even a very small amount, I just felt terrible from it.

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:33.800
 And about maybe two weeks ago I tried -- I was able to get pure fructose.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:40.800
 And after about two or three days of taking fairly large quantities of fructose, I really felt great.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:46.800
 And I noticed I had a tolerance where I could actually consume all types of sugar.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:55.800
 And I was able to, you know, have anything from soda to orange juice or whatever.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.800
 And I felt -- I was starting to feel really good after about a week from it.

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:08.800
 And the problem is recently, maybe about two or three days ago, I started having pretty bad sleep problems as a result of --

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:16.800
 well, I'm not entirely sure, but it feels -- it felt, you know, sort of similar to when I eat MSG

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.800
 and I have like a pain in the lower part of my rib cage.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:29.800
 And so just the last maybe day I was able to -- I switched over to starch, which is similar to like what I was on beforehand.

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:37.800
 And it was, you know, like my sleep kind of normalized.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.800
 What kind of fat were you having with it?

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:52.800
 Primarily coconut oil and butter, not much else other than that.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.800
 Have you had any digestive problems noticeable?

01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:03.800
 Well, actually I noticed when I was on the sugar it was actually quite a bit -- I mean, it was much better.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:08.800
 I mean, very, very noticeably better.

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:18.800
 And with the starch it's sort of like -- it's not so good, but I've maybe been on it for maybe like a day or two

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.800
 and the sleep sort of normalized very quickly.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:26.800
 And I'm just wondering, maybe it's like some sort of detox or I don't know.

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:34.800
 I think it's probably that the starch is getting digested and assimilated more slowly

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:47.800
 and that eating some fiber with your carbohydrate, fiber and fat will extend the absorption of it longer.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:56.800
 And the normal thing is that the sugar is absorbed quickly in the upper part of the intestine

01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:03.800
 and starch, if it's slow to break down, can feed bacteria lower in the intestine

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:09.800
 and cause intestinal inflammation that interrupts sleep.

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.800
 Okay.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.800
 I mean, I have very high RT3.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.800
 Would that have anything to do with it?

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:19.800
 Yeah, that's from high stress.

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.800
 Okay.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:26.800
 And getting your endotoxin and cortisol down.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:36.800
 I've seen quite a few people just with a daily carrot get their intestine disinfected enough

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:43.800
 that their reverse T3 goes down and their cortisol goes down.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:50.800
 So the combination of fat and fiber might be a way to make your blood sugar steadier.

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.800
 Okay.

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:53.800
 Well, I'll definitely try that.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.800
 But the fructose is really unbelievable.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.800
 That's good to hear.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.800
 Well, thank you very much.

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:05.800
 Thanks for calling in.

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.800
 Good questions, guys.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:11.800
 If you still have more, you can call in 347-426-3546.

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:17.800
 We've got another question here on dental health.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:23.800
 Question about there's a lot of people who recommend eliminating sucrose, fructose, and most fruits

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.800
 when people have dental ailments.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:31.800
 And on the other side of it, you know, you talk about increasing, you know, carbohydrates, you know,

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.800
 for cell metabolism, et cetera.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:37.800
 Can you elaborate a little bit on that, why there's so much conflicting information on that,

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.800
 and what contributes to dental issues?

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:45.800
 I saw a recent article on dental health in Sweden,

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:53.800
 and they saw that during the time that cavities have decreased radically,

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:59.800
 sugar, candy, and soft drink consumption had actually increased,

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:05.800
 and they couldn't account for why the teeth were healthier while they were --

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:16.800
 the basic diet hadn't changed so much, but had increased in the supposedly cavity-causing snack foods.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:29.800
 And in my sugar article, I mention some of the old studies in which they modified the thyroid or estrogen

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:39.800
 and found that increased estrogen increased the dental decay, increased thyroid reduced the dental decay.

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:53.800
 And one whole line of dental research has shown that stress will very quickly cause an outbreak of cavities.

01:20:53.800 --> 01:21:02.800
 And mainline dentistry just thinks in terms of germ growth in the mouth

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:12.800
 and completely neglects the chemical and immunological function of the saliva.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:18.800
 I think the saliva is the mediator of stress.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:24.800
 Interesting. Now, kind of going on to a different topic,

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:29.800
 this question I think is in regard to -- I'm not sure if you're familiar with it, I'm not too familiar with it --

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:33.800
 the work of Dr. Ron Vignieri, he's a PhD,

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:40.800
 and they want to know that -- you know, he talks about fasting in --

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.800
 for at least periods of protein restriction to upregulate the process of --

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:49.800
 I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing this right -- autophagy, or autophagy, I don't know.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.800
 Oh.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:55.800
 Or the self-eating of old and damaged proteins, which is supposed to help starve off diseases, including cancer.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:59.800
 What's your thoughts on that?

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:10.800
 Well, activating your metabolism, running things faster, is going to eat up proteins that shouldn't be there.

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:18.800
 And one of the main things interfering with the breakdown of protein is the PUFA,

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.800
 especially the long-chain PUFA that accumulate with aging.

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:36.800
 And people like to talk about the membranes as where the fatty acids are active

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:46.800
 and where they make a difference, but the experimental background of what the membranes consist of

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:53.800
 is just completely ignored by mainstream medicine.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:23:03.800
 Like cholesterol itself is part of our cell division apparatus, part of the chromosomes,

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:13.800
 part of many functional proteins, so are the free fatty acids and the phospholipids that they participate in.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:31.800
 The nuclear structure and the cell division structure is regulated or deranged by the type of fatty acids in your diet.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:49.800
 And accumulating the long-chain unsaturated fatty acids with aging is changing the way the cell functions at the deepest levels.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:57.800
 Now, kind of on that same note, you have people like, if you haven't heard it, Cynthia Kenyon's work and Rob Wolf,

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:02.800
 all these people that promote carb restriction for longevity.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:09.800
 What's your thoughts on that?

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:18.800
 In the short range, just fasting itself will reduce the endotoxin absorption,

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:25.800
 and so that's always an effect that can help things like arthritis and so on.

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:34.800
 And dropping your carbohydrate intake will raise your cortisol production,

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:41.800
 and people feel better very often from either fasting or just dropping the carbohydrate intake

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:51.800
 because the cortisol excess produces a sort of anesthetic euphoria.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:59.800
 People can get addicted to taking cortisol pills because it makes them feel good, makes the pain go away,

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:03.800
 but in the long run, that's stressful.

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:12.800
 To turn protein into the carbohydrate that your brain and blood cells need,

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:20.800
 it requires a shift towards a higher cortisol function to break down the proteins.

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:25.800
 And so what you're doing is running on stress so that the proteins that you eat

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:30.800
 will be converted to the sugar that you need.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:37.800
 And if you have the carbohydrate in your diet, your cortisol is going to run lower,

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.800
 like the monkeys they've studied.

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:50.800
 When fruits are scarce, they have very high levels of cortisol.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:51.800
 Yeah, yeah.

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.800
 I remember one of your articles, I posted something the other day about that.

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.800
 It's pretty interesting stuff.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:04.800
 Now, kind of going on a different topic, someone wants to know about your thoughts on cell phones,

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:10.800
 and are they really unhealthy, or do you feel like it's just like microwave threats?

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:19.800
 Well, microwaves are a threat, and so they fixed the ovens so that they weren't irradiating people so much.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:28.800
 The ovens used to not have good seals on the doors and used to actually emit very intense fields.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.800
 And the telephones, the same way.

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:39.800
 There have been experiments for over 50 years showing that there are real biological effects

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:44.800
 from even moderately weak fields.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:49.800
 But here is the doctrine of the cell membrane.

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:57.800
 Again, the standard medical doctrine is that a cell has a fat membrane around it

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:05.800
 because it needs something to seal in a watery solution of chemicals to isolate it from the environment

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:14.800
 because you have high potassium and magnesium in the cell, low calcium and sodium,

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:21.800
 and to maintain that balance, they visualize needing this barrier membrane.

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:33.800
 And so they see a random solution of chemicals in water as being what life of the cell is,

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:42.800
 and therefore for a radiation to affect the chemistry of the cell,

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:51.800
 it has to be just like the effect of the same radiation on those chemicals in a test tube.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:59.800
 And they show that you have to basically have enough microwave energy to cook an egg or something

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:06.800
 before you see damage to the chemistry of those enzymes and such in a test tube.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:13.800
 But in the cell, the whole problem is that there is no such barrier membrane.

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:20.800
 It's the whole structure of the cell which does the regulation,

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:27.800
 not a magical barrier at the surface that keeps a random solution inside.

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:36.800
 The whole cell is so highly organized that many of the regions have an antenna-like function

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:43.800
 that responds to very low levels of electromagnetic energy.

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:49.800
 And if you actually do the experiments, you can see that an animal's behavior,

01:28:49.800 --> 01:29:01.800
 chromosome function, reproduction, and so on, will change at very low levels that aren't heating the enzymes,

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:05.800
 aren't heating the organism noticeably.

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:15.800
 But it's this very persistent doctrine in medicine that the inside of a cell is a random solution.

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:19.800
 That's the basis for saying that microwaves are harmless.

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.800
 Right.

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:25.800
 Going back to the thyroid, someone has a question about, you know, you say thyroid a lot,

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.800
 and they want to know what you mean.

01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:30.800
 I assume you're always talking about T3.

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:35.800
 And at the same time, there's a lot of people out there trying to buy glandulars

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:40.800
 because they can't take T3 or they can't get T3.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:46.800
 So the first question is, do you recommend, if people need it, for people to take thyroid glandulars?

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:50.800
 And my question is as well, I've read somewhere, I don't remember,

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:54.800
 that if people are really -- if their adrenals are really super stressed

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:59.800
 and there is something going on with them, that if you do take something for the thyroid,

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:05.800
 that you can actually get worse because you don't have the energy reserves to actually handle the increase in metabolism.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:11.800
 If a person's cholesterol is down around 100 milligrams per cent,

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:14.800
 then they have to be careful with everything.

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:17.800
 They're very fragile.

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:21.800
 The cholesterol is a basic anti-stress substance.

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:30.800
 You've got to get the cholesterol up to at least normal, minimum 160 milligrams per cent,

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:43.800
 possibly somewhat higher, before you worry about increasing your general metabolic rate and energy production.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:51.800
 And orange juice is usually the safest first way to get your cholesterol up to normal.

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:59.800
 And then if your cholesterol is up and you're getting enough of the vitamins and minerals that are essential,

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:05.800
 then the thyroid will very quickly make your adrenal glands adapt.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:17.800
 And with the balanced thyroid hormones that were in the traditional thyroid glands that people got in fish head soup

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:26.800
 or chicken stew where the neck included the thyroid gland, those traditional diets,

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:34.800
 the thyroid consisted of about three parts of T4 to one part of T3.

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:54.800
 And as the liver gets energy in the form of glucose, it will convert T4 to T3 to adjust the amount of T3 and energy production.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:07.800
 If you don't have sugar and take your glandular, you just experience about 25 per cent of the potential effect of it.

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:12.800
 Your liver is not going to activate the rest of the T4.

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:23.800
 So the glandular is in a way safer because it lets your liver handle your physiology to a great extent.

01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:37.800
 If you try to take just T3 and completely satisfy all your thyroid needs with pure T3, your TSH goes down,

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:41.800
 your thyroid stops working momentarily.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:48.800
 But if you don't take your T3 during the night, your TSH is going to rev up

01:32:48.800 --> 01:33:03.800
 and turn on a lot of inflammatory processes and you'll experience acute hypothyroidism in just 8 to 12 hours of not taking your T3.

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:11.800
 So it's most convenient for most people to have some of the T4 as in the glandulars.

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:21.800
 The trouble is the technology of making a glandular product seems to have been lost.

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:30.800
 Armour was making their traditional thyroid product for about 85 or 90 years.

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:40.800
 And Revlon, the cosmetics company, bought the product and went through several changes of ownership.

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:49.800
 And in the process, the new owner decided to extract thyrocalcitonin to have a new product.

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:59.800
 And so they kept selling the remains of the thyroid gland minus the calcitonin

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:05.800
 and subject to whatever process was needed to separate it.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:17.800
 The new thyroid glandular, even in the so-called traditional armour, is no longer what it used to be.

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:25.800
 And there has been research to catch up with the new product.

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:32.800
 So if you think about the research that was done with armour for all of the 20th century,

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:44.800
 I don't necessarily say that it's going to apply to whatever is being made with the so-called armour equivalent or generic material.

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:55.800
 If the manufacturer is selling part of it separately, it isn't really the traditional product.

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:58.800
 That's good stuff right there.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:05.800
 Can you talk a little bit more or just talk a little bit about the correlation and the roles between magnesium and calcium?

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:11.800
 And one of the questions was about they feel your diet recommendations are high in calcium.

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:15.800
 What's the optimal ratio and where would you get magnesium?

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:22.800
 Well, coffee is a great source of magnesium.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:30.800
 If you're not under stress and your thyroid is good, your cells have a tremendous ability to retain magnesium

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:36.800
 because it binds to the ATP molecule, becomes part of the molecule.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:43.800
 And if your thyroid is low and you don't produce ATP fast enough,

01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:49.800
 the cell doesn't have the main thing that binds magnesium intracellularly

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:54.800
 and so it tends to go out into the bloodstream and get lost in the urine.

01:35:54.800 --> 01:36:01.800
 So your thyroid status is the main thing that determines how much magnesium you need.

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:10.800
 A low sodium intake will make you lose magnesium by increasing the aldosterone production.

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:24.800
 And you can't talk about the ideal ratio of the minerals in the abstract because it's the interaction.

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.800
 And the same with calcium.

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:33.800
 Calcium lowers a lot of the excitatory, inflammatory things,

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:38.800
 which would tend to make you lose magnesium and sodium.

01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:43.800
 And so if you have a diet that seems to be deficient in one of these,

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:54.800
 you can very often solve the problem with any of the other four, potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium.

01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:01.800
 William Frederick Koch, who was one of the first people to study the parathyroid gland,

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:12.800
 would remove the gland and cause the muscle contractions from the absence of the parathyroid hormone.

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:20.800
 But he found that he could cure the spasms with any of the minerals, not just calcium,

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:26.800
 but potassium, sodium, or magnesium would also cure the spasms.

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:36.800
 So it's a matter of having a total of these alkaline minerals, not an exact balance.

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:46.800
 And one thing that is another factor that interferes is the phosphorus or phosphate intake.

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:52.800
 A lot of Americans get seven times as much phosphate as calcium.

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:58.800
 And it takes many years for the effects to show up.

01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:08.800
 But one of the functions of fructose is to make you lose phosphate faster than otherwise,

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:16.800
 and that's supporting the function of the parathyroid gland to improve the ratio between calcium and phosphorus.

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:27.800
 And if your fructose intake is high, then you don't have to worry too much about the exact ratio of calcium to phosphorus.

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:37.800
 But the ratio in milk, 1.3 to 1, is very close to a very safe ratio.

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:49.800
 But you can easily get by with two or three times as much phosphate as calcium, especially if your sugar intake is good.

01:38:49.800 --> 01:39:03.800
 And then if you're getting plenty of salt and calcium, you don't have to worry much about the other two alkaline minerals.

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:07.800
 Doesn't calcium and phosphorus have an inverse relationship in the body?

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:09.800
 So if one's high, one's technically lower a lot of the time?

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.800
 Yeah.

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:15.800
 And then a lot of people that do, because a lot of people will take magnesium or a CalMag supplement

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:19.800
 because they have restless leg syndrome, etc.

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:24.800
 So a lot of the times, if they're deficient in calcium, the cells have taken up calcium.

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:29.800
 By taking calcium alone, you can actually decrease that excitatory nature

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:33.800
 and upregulate magnesium itself without any take in it. Is that true, too?

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:46.800
 Yeah. That's why potassium and sodium and calcium will often prevent cramps or spasms and such.

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:50.800
 They're helping you retain your magnesium more efficiently.

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:52.800
 Right.

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:56.800
 Just a couple more questions, and we can wrap it up.

01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:00.800
 If anyone has any calls, feel free to call in 347 or any questions.

01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:04.800
 347-426-3546.

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.800
 Anything you want to add in, Ray?

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:07.800
 Nope.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:08.800
 Okay.

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:10.800
 I have a kind of off-the-wall question.

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:14.800
 I didn't even know you were working on this, and I don't know if you even know you're working on this,

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:23.800
 but a caller or follower had a question about if you were working on or almost finished with your book on the thyroid.

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:26.800
 I didn't know. I'm working on it right now.

01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:30.800
 Okay. That's a bummer.

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:32.800
 Another kind of off-the-wall question.

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:39.800
 One of the listeners wanted to know if all the emails that you get from followers,

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:49.800
 if you feel supported or if they're becoming a nuisance.

01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:58.800
 There are some people who ask very trivial questions that they should just think about or look up for themselves.

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:00.800
 Right. Yeah.

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:01.800
 No, that's a good point.

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:02.800
 It's a good point.

01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:08.800
 And like I've said before, guys, if you're emailing him, you need to kind of compensate him for his time.

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.800
 And at the same time, he's got tons of articles on his site.

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:14.800
 Take the time to read them.

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:18.800
 That's an important aspect of it.

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:21.800
 So if you guys want to call in, I'm pretty much out of questions.

01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:25.800
 I mean, I rattled through probably 50, 60 questions.

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:28.800
 There were some general ones, but like I said, I felt like people --

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:31.800
 I didn't ask them because I feel like people would just read some of your articles

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:34.800
 and I don't think they're questions you need to answer.

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:41.800
 So before we kind of wrap up, guys, if you have any questions, 347-426-3546.

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:43.800
 Ray doesn't really have anything else to add.

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:49.800
 As he mentioned, I'm pretty much out of questions from people.

01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:52.800
 So before we hang up, if you've got any questions, feel free to call in.

01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.800
 We've got about 15 minutes left.

01:41:54.800 --> 01:42:00.800
 It's been a pretty long show, and in my opinion, it's been an awesome show.

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.800
 So does anyone have any other questions?

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:03.800
 Feel free to call in.

01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:04.800
 You can email me as well.

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:09.800
 I'm getting a lot of emails and Facebook from people in regards to their questions.

01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:17.800
 Let me just take one more check to see if any are popping up.

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:18.800
 No, that's about it.

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.800
 I think that's all.

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:31.800
 I might comment about -- I was talking about the changes in the manufacture of thyroid glandulars.

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:38.800
 Vitamin E is another thing that has undergone radical changes.

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:47.800
 When ADM bought the old Eastman distillation products factory for making vitamin E,

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:55.800
 they changed the methods and the consistency and appearance of vitamin E changed a lot,

01:42:55.800 --> 01:43:04.800
 and then the FDA told them they had to start acknowledging that they were diluting it with soy oil and such.

01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:15.800
 But still, the product that's commonly in use looks very different from the old material.

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:29.800
 When I was working at the university lab, the freezer had some old vitamin E from Sigma that they had used in research in the '50s,

01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:41.800
 and I tested some of that with experiments I was doing on liver extracts and got reactions that were extremely interesting

01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:49.800
 that I've subsequently tried with the newer vitamin E's that I get no reaction at all.

01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:59.800
 So there were chemical functions present that are interfered with by something that's appearing in the vitamin E.

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:09.800
 And the research up until about 1990, from the 1920s on,

01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:23.800
 was just unanimously about its beneficial effects except for the periodic attacks in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:33.800
 But then in the last 10 or 15 years, there have been more publications about ineffectiveness of vitamin E or possible adverse effects.

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:44.800
 And I've been thinking about what some of the changes from the original 1930s and '40s product might have been.

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:54.800
 And the saturated long-chain alcohols, octocosinol and polycosinol,

01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:06.800
 were always associated with the original ways they made vitamin E that increased the viscosity.

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:12.800
 Wheat germ oil was a common starting material,

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:25.800
 and that was rich in these very long-chain, completely saturated alcohols, which immediately metabolized into long-chain saturated fatty acids.

01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:32.800
 And if you look up the research on octocosinol and polycosinol,

01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:44.800
 you'll see that there was a lot of endurance effect, improved endurance from the use of small amounts of these.

01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:52.800
 And I suspect that the original vitamin E research,

01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:59.800
 which showed that it protected against the polyunsaturated fatty acids and their toxic effects,

01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:09.800
 I think a large part of that might have been from adding the completely saturated long fatty acids along with the vitamin E,

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:24.800
 sort of neutralizing the PUFA, similar to Han-Selye's research in which he showed that canola would cause death of heart cells.

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:31.800
 But if he added chocolate fat, cocoa butter, to the same amount of canola,

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:40.800
 the heart had no injury at all. So the saturated fats have a defensive antitoxic effect.

01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:47.800
 I suspect were part of vitamin E's original action.

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:55.800
 Good stuff. We've got another caller. We'll take this one last caller from the area code 253. You're on the air.

01:46:55.800 --> 01:47:04.800
 Hi. This is Justin from Washington. I was reading one of Ray's older books,

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:15.800
 and I saw something in there about, very interesting on the correlation between how Mexican children didn't get polio

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:21.800
 and its correlation to the milling of wheat and such things.

01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:27.800
 I was wondering if he had any comments on other vaccinations, how he felt about that,

01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:33.800
 or anything to do with the infectious disease model.

01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:40.800
 Oh, yeah. I suspect that the same thing that the Mexican immigrants in California,

01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:50.800
 the kids were immune to a lot of the childhood infectious diseases just because of their relative iron deficiency.

01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:55.800
 I think that's probably a big factor in the traditional Mexican diet.

01:47:55.800 --> 01:48:08.800
 And the traditional tortillas, interestingly, are very high in calcium because they boil it in lime.

01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:14.800
 And it leaves a large amount of calcium.

01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:28.800
 My dentist in Mexico tells me that her clients with some tooth problem might come in when they're 80 or 90 years old

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:30.800
 and want a painful tooth extracted.

01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:37.800
 She said sometimes it takes her all afternoon to get a tooth out of one of these old people.

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:45.800
 And she thinks it's the high calcium intake for their lifetime diet of tortillas.

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:57.800
 And that has an undoubted anti-stress effect along with the low iron intake on average.

01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:59.800
 Wow. Great stuff.

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:01.800
 I just want to thank you, Ray, for doing real science.

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:04.800
 And like Josh said, everyone else that's listening,

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:08.800
 I'm going to throw together a little Christmas card and send it out with $20 or something.

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:12.800
 I hope we can all pull together and support some real science.

01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:15.800
 I know there's a lot of people out there that really appreciate you, Ray.

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:17.800
 I just wanted to thank you.

01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:24.800
 About vaccination, I wanted to mention Ivan Illich's books, Medical Nemesis, for example.

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:31.800
 He does some good stuff on the history of vaccination.

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:33.800
 Cool.

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:36.800
 Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Have a good night.

01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:37.800
 Thanks, Justin, from Washington.

01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:39.800
 All right. Bye.

01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:42.800
 Bye.

01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.800
 We've got one last question, and I'll read it to you because it just got emailed to me.

01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:54.800
 What do you feel about all the research regarding cell membrane and membrane signaling in the biotech field?

01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:57.800
 Do you feel like it's a waste of time?

01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:07.800
 Well, it's very good business because they can sell anything if they say it's working on signals via the cell membrane.

01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:16.800
 But basically, if a cell is stressed, it will admit things that it wouldn't otherwise

01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:19.800
 and lose things that it shouldn't lose.

01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:26.800
 If a fat is attached to a substance, it'll get into the cell where it wouldn't otherwise.

01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:34.800
 But when they talk about surface receptors, very often, if they actually experiment,

01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:42.800
 it can be demonstrated that the substance is acting inside the cell, not just at the surface.

01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:47.800
 This goes back 80 years, probably.

01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:52.800
 Well, 150 years if you look at the whole history.

01:50:52.800 --> 01:51:08.800
 People have been in the '30s were showing that their experiments showed clear entrance of large molecules right into the cell in large quantities.

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:20.800
 Albumin was repeatedly seen to massively enter cells of all different types and carry with it whatever it carried.

01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:36.800
 But immunoglobulin, several iron-transporting proteins, a whole range of our normal proteins just zip in and out of cells freely.

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:44.800
 So the membrane is not very relevant to actual cell physiology.

01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:55.800
 If you want to look at some of the mainstream research, Fritjof Sjostrand, S-J-O-S-T-R-A-N-D,

01:51:55.800 --> 01:52:05.800
 who was a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, for many years, founded the Journal of Ultrastructure Research

01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:11.800
 and was the chief editor for about, I guess, 30 or 40 years.

01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:31.800
 His work pretty much all by itself made the conventional ideas about plasma membranes on the outside of the cell, mitochondrial membranes, mitochondrial function.

01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:41.800
 His work is just completely incompatible with the doctrine that is so popular.

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:48.800
 Well, that's interesting stuff. Definitely not something I'm too up on, but it's good stuff for everyone to listen to.

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:53.800
 So I don't have any more questions. I know people are sending me questions. I only have so much time, guys.

01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:57.800
 And some of the questions I don't feel appropriate. At the same time, send me your questions.

01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:03.800
 I've definitely answered in past shows, and I'm not going to sit here and, unfortunately, ask the same questions over and over again.

01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:07.800
 It's just not something I feel comfortable doing.

01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:10.800
 So I thank you, Ray, for this great show and this year.

01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:16.800
 I know everyone, like we keep saying, really listens to your shows, thousands of people.

01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:25.800
 They really appreciate your work. I know you probably hear it a lot, but we just want to say thank you because it's been a great year.

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:28.800
 Taking the time to share all this info has helped a lot of people.

01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:31.800
 Okay, and thank you for sharing it.

01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:32.800
 Thank you, Ray. Have a good day.

01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:33.800
 Okay, bye.

01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:35.800
 Bye.

01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:42.800
 So there you go, guys. Dr. Ray Peat once again, the most humble man I've ever talked to in my life.

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:46.800
 It's a great show. Listen to it again and again. Listen to all the other shows.

01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:52.800
 I know you have a lot of questions. A lot of your questions were asked in a lot of the old shows.

01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:56.800
 Definitely tune in for more shows in the new year. I'm going to send them out to Ray.

01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:00.800
 And like I've said, I know tons of people are emailing him.

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:05.800
 Make sure you have to understand that, of course, he's a technical guy.

01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:12.800
 So if you're sending him questions that are very basic, I know a lot of the times, like he said, you can get a lot of this information from his articles.

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:19.800
 But if you are consistently emailing him, make sure, like I said, whether it's $1, $5, $10, whatever it is, it adds up.

01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:25.800
 Send him a card. Send him $5, $10, $100 if you want to, to say thanks.

01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:29.800
 Thanks for all the email questions, Merry Christmas, or whatever you want to send.

01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:34.800
 And that's something that I think is very appropriate for what's been going on.

01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:40.800
 So I thank all our listeners for tuning in to all the shows. Of course, I couldn't do the show without you guys.

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:43.800
 So I really appreciate everyone tuning in.

01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:51.800
 Stay tuned to our Facebook pages, Josh Rubin, Jeanne Rubin, or EastWest Alien Performance for great updates,

01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:54.800
 as well as for some of the new shows starting in 2012.

01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:58.800
 Wish everyone a happy holiday season and New Year, and I'm out of here.
