00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 You are listening to WMRW-LP, Warren, 95.1 FM.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 The following program presents the views of its participants and producers.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 It does not necessarily represent the views of WMRW or its license holder, RootsWork.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 All right.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Lisa, keep community radio going. Call 496-4951. Click on the pig at WMRW.org.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 Give what you can.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Give what you can.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Yes.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Hey, everyone, and welcome to Politics and Science. I'm your host, John Barkhausen.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 This week, we return to the archives of my Ray Peat interviews.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 This is from WGDR in Plainfield, Vermont, part of Goddard College.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 And these interviews were done between, I think, 1999 and about 2003.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 This particular one's about radiation, different types of radiation, RF radiation mostly.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 I think we also mentioned ionizing radiation as in nuclear power and nuclear industrial military radiation.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 But he also talks about some interesting scientists, Yuri Hologolko, Trump, and some things you won't hear from anybody else.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 It's pretty interesting, I think, but then I'm a little bit biased about this.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 But I hope you enjoy it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 And Ray Peat has a website. He's still teaching out in Eugene, Oregon.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 He also does nutritional consulting. And on his website, he has, I think, maybe 90 articles.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 There were former newsletters of his that you can also subscribe to.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 But if you want to read archived newsletters, they're fantastic.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 They have full references, so you can look up where he gets his ideas and how he reaches his conclusions.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 And you can go to raypeat.com to browse through his site and look up issues that are interesting to you.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 That's r-a-y-p-e-a-t dot com.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 And now we pick up in mid-program Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 He's a physiologist and endocrinologist from Eugene, Oregon.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 And we start talking about radiation.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 I hope you enjoy it.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 So, should we go on to a totally different subject?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Okay.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 And it's cell phones.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Yeah.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 And I was wondering, I'm confused about what the difference is between cell phones,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 and then you have remote phones, which I have in my house.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 And then there's also radio frequencies, you know, like associated with this radio station.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 The remote phone just has a weak transmitter and receiver.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 The transmitter doesn't have to go more than 100 feet or something like that.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Right.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 I think they're called 900 megahertz or some of them.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Yeah, the strength of the field is so much lower, it isn't much of a worry.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 But the cell phone produces really not quite a brain-melting field,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 but definitely a biologically significant field.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 So they have to be much more powerful to go further.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Yeah.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 They have to transmit your signals, not just your home telephone,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 but have to transmit it to wherever the receiver is, the relay station.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Is that considered a microwave?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 Yeah.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 It's a very high frequency?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Yeah.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Radar is, you know, they used to talk about radar range.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 I think that was the brand of microwave oven.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Right.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 That range, it's short for radio waves, like a shortwave radio is in a few meters length.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Radar is in the centimeter length, a few inches.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 And television, the television band overlaps a little bit with the shortwave band.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Television is a fairly shortwave.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 A few feet or something?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Yeah, like I noticed that my body would resonate with one of the channels,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 and the cat's body would resonate with, I think it was channel 11,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 so that the TV would go out of tune when the cat walked near it on channel 12

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 and out of tune on, I think it was channel 6 for me.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 So you can visualize the way the waves resonate with an animal of a certain length.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 I see.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 And after the Second World War, they had killed a few people.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 A few sailors would walk in front of a radar antenna,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 and so they would die and they would find that they had been cooked,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 their brain would be cooked.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 And so they did experiments on monkeys,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 and they found that the size of the organ or brain

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 would determine how hot that organ got in a field of a given wavelength,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 so that a monkey with a little brain would have its brain cooked

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 by a shorter wave, higher frequency radar.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 That's interesting.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 My brother-in-law had an experience of, I think he'd seen seagulls explode

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 when he was in the Navy when they flew too close to a radar.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 And I think he also had an experience of being on a tower,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 you know, he was an E.T., an electronic technician,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 and he was trying to fix the radar.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 And there was some point where it was turned on accidentally when he was up there

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 and he should have been cooked, but it didn't cook him,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 and he never could figure out why it didn't.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 Well, if it's the wrong frequency, you don't resonate very well.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 It's like the difference between the cat and me and the different channels of TV.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 Theoretically, you could design a frequency of microwaves

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 that would cook a tumor selectively.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 People have tried to use microwaves.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 They're still doing it to kill tumors,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 but generally it's something about the anti-scientific mind of the medical people.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 They don't get very subtle,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 and so they'll treat a breast cancer by jamming an antenna through the person's chest

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 or really gross ways of applying the microwave frequency

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 where it is at least theoretically possible to tune the microwave to a solid tumor.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 The MRI, molecular resonance imaging, uses a very fine version of this.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 You can tune in to one type of molecule rather than another type.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 The resonance can distinguish one kind of atom from another kind of atom.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Wow.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 That involves just having a strong, steady magnetic field and scanning a microwave.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 You can distinguish water from drier tissues, how much water a tissue has in it, and so on.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Since cancers are wetter, they're young,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 and so the cells are, if they're growing faster,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 they're younger and more water-loaded than mature cells.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 So you can visualize a cancer very easily by this microwave absorbing ability of their water molecules.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Some people have suggested that just because of the high water content,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 you could selectively heat and kill tumors.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 That hasn't been developed as far as I know,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 but the solidity and size of a round tumor can allow it to be selectively heated.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 The heating effect is one in which water molecules,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 for example infrared rays, selectively resonate with water molecules.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 The rotation and vibration of water is fairly specific for infrared

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 so that infrared doesn't go through water very far.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 Water molecules have different degrees of association with proteins and fats in the living cell,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 and so different wavelengths and different energies

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 will select out different conditions of the water molecules with which they resonate.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 So you can distinguish the looseness or the freeness of the water molecule

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 by how it resonates to the microwaves.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 These effects have been known as long as the technique of molecular resonance

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 has been known,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 so there's no big mystery to why cells should be able to detect and respond to

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 and be harmed by microwaves far below the strength at which they would be cooked to death

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 because they resonate to really very weak environmental fields.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 In a steady magnetic field,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 they tend to align their electrons and nuclei with that field,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 and then the alignment with that field

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 governs how they're going to interact with a microwave coming through.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 So you have competing alignments basically between the oscillating field and the steady field.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 And while this is the alignment of the nucleus of the atom and the electrons,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 in some situations the electrons are relatively free to resonate,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 and the living state is full of these relatively free electrons,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 like free radical electrons.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 But all of our metabolic processes depend on some relatively free electrons,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 and these are very susceptible to electromagnetic field interference.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Changing their alignment changes their ability to associate or resonate with each other.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 Since they have to resonate with each other to perform the biological functions,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 then external fields interfere with the ways that they interact with each other.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 Right. So they can't function properly.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Yeah. So that's a very subtle biological response that you can see in animal experiments.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 You can train animals to respond to a microwave field, for example,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 that is very far below the heating threshold.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 In 1968, I had been reading the work of Yuri Holodov on sensing magnetic fields,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 and I went to Moscow to visit him,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 and he gave me a reading list and told me about his work.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 And he knew more about the sensitivity of cells to electric fields,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 the work that was being done in the United States,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 than my nerve biology and physiology professors at the university knew.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 He just had tremendous access to world research,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 which my professors didn't even want to hear about.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Right. They already knew everything.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 Yeah.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 In, I think it was 1960, Linus Pauling proposed a theory to explain how anesthetics work.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 He called it the clathrate theory of anesthesia,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 in which it's analogous to something that happens in deep sea areas where methane is being produced.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 Methane causes freezing of the water.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 It orders the water molecules so that ice forms even above the freezing temperature of water.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 And this same phenomenon sometimes causes sludging in natural gas pipelines.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Ice forms even at room temperature.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 And corn plants can form ice crystals above the freezing temperature of water.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 The clathrate principle is well established,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 but Linus Pauling just said, "Well, maybe this will explain anesthesia because..."

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 They didn't know how it works?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 No, they still don't know how anything works.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 They being the medical establishment and the science establishment.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 But Linus Pauling being an alert person said,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 "Well, why not use this established physical principle for explaining how a similar chemical..."

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 He said, "You can't even conceive or theorize about how the noble gases create anesthesia."

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 At high pressure, nitrogen will anesthetize you as in deep sea divers.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 But that functions as a noble or inert gas.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 At extremely high pressure, helium will do the same thing.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 And as you approach atmospheric pressure, the heavier noble gases are anesthetic

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 so that neon, krypton, xenon, xenon and krypton are anesthetic close to atmospheric pressures.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 He said, "These are not chemically reactive.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 How are you going to explain anesthesia by xenon and krypton?"

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 Right.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 And he showed that the Clathrate principle explains this perfectly

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 that the noble gases work just like the natural gas, methane and organic molecules in general

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 that immobilize water molecules.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 And he said, "Maybe this is simply intensifying a process that normally occurs in the resting cell

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 and it locks cells into the resting relatively insensitive state."

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 And two of the researchers that Yuri Holodov referred me to had books published in English,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 but their books were fairly unknown.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 Madeline Barnathy and her husband published some books on biomagnetism.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 And the founder of the science of biometeorology was named Salco Tromp.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 He was in Holland and he wrote some very impressive books in English.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 As early as, I think, 1940 or so, his first book,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 he surveyed the physical world looking for ways in which the environment interacts with organisms.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 And liquid crystals were known way back in the '20s and '30s,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 but no one knew what to do with them.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Salco Tromp, looking the way Linus Pauling did for physical principles

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 that explain interactions between such things as atmospheric pressure and electromagnetic fields,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 he saw the phenomenon of liquid crystals and said, "The cells behave in many ways like liquid crystals,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 organized but liquid."

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 And if people had read his books on biometeorology,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 they would have come up with liquid crystal display screens about 30 years earlier

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 because he was explaining the same things, the same biological events,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 that Madeline Barnathy and her husband demonstrated

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 that people and other animals can detect a change even in a steady magnetic field at a very low level.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 And the facts are there, the methods are there,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 liquid crystals and clathrates and organized cell structures respond to these very low energy fields.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 But the Navy physicists and medical people

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 didn't want to have their draftees worrying about subtle effects,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 so they said that radar will only hurt you if it cooks your brain or your liver.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 And that propaganda put out by the government in the 1950s

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 to say that microwaves will only hurt you if they cook you,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 that fits in with what the government was saying about low-level radiation from nuclear fallout,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 that if it doesn't blister you, it won't hurt you at all.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 There's a threshold of harm.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Basically, it's an interlocking system in which the government's lies about nuclear radiation

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 meshed with the lies about microwave and radar radiation.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 And then it created a culture in which doctors

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 who didn't want to get sued for treating dandruff and acne with deadly doses of x-rays,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 they had a very powerful motive.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 They really did that?

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Yeah, I knew people whose faces collapsed because they had had such intense doses of radiation.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 I had never heard that.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 The bones simply disappeared in their faces.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 And they treated dandruff and ringworm with x-ray.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 And the brain, Yuri Holodov showed that the brain and the testicle

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 are the two organs most sensitive to radiation of any sort, ionizing or magnetic or microwave.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 That's disgusting if they did that.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 So the medical community had this, starting at the turn of the century,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 had this very strong built-in motive not to be held liable for damages or murder.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 And so they loved the government's stories about radiation and microwaves.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 And so the medical scientific community from the '50s on built up this idea

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 that if it doesn't cook you or if it doesn't ionize your cells, then it's harmless.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 It's below the threshold of harm.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 But people are still saying this.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 I saw recent articles in which they said microwaves don't have enough energy to ionize anything,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 so therefore they can't do anything to you.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Yeah, and now we have towers going up.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 I just drove back from the Midwest and I was really impressed.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 Along the highway there seems like this giant 120-foot tower

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 with what I believe are microwaves with Peters on top for all the cell phone traffic.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 And I know in the city it's even worse

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 because I believe you have to have one in every corner of every block

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 so that you can have uninterrupted phone service as you walk down the street.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 And I believe that's very close.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 It's not very high off the ground and people are walking right under it.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 I don't know, how do you feel about the exposure from the towers themselves?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 Well, most cities now downtown, they have such a high field intensity from microwaves,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 telephone microwaves especially,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 they're way up in the danger range known to produce leukemia and mutations.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 In the '70s and '80s they knew that quail eggs, for example, that hatched near power lines,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 the sex ratio of the hatchlings was grossly distorted.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 It was practically all females.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 The males died or were modified.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 And someone who knew about that looked at the children of telephone linemen

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 and saw that they had children with an extremely distorted sex ratio.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 The Y chromosome sperm cell seems to be more fragile

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 and microwaves can break chromosomes among other things on the grosser level.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 So how do you feel about microwave ovens?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 They used to put out leakage that would be harmful at three or four feet,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 but I think the government standards coming in in the '80s clamped down on those leakers.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 And I've measured the field around them and beyond three feet I think they're nowadays safe.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 So you don't want to stand there reading a book while you're...

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Not right up against them.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Coffee's heating up.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 Yeah.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 So do you think the remote phones that people use in their houses,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 the 900 megahertz phones, do you think those are fairly safe?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 I know there's quite a difference between the cell phones also.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Yeah, I think the little remote phones that only transmit 100 feet,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 I think those aren't enough to worry about because walking downtown,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 on the downtown streets you're getting much higher intensity radiation.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Just from the cell phones?

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 Yeah, from the repeater stations.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Yeah.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 And radio waves like this FM station right here we're sitting inside of this...

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 Yeah, I hope your tower isn't near you.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 It's about 50 feet away I'd say.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 Really, the transmitting tower?

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 Yeah.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 That's not probably safe.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 Yeah, I've heard there's an apartment complex right near it too.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 I had a friend living there and he said even his toaster

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 couldn't receive the dotted radio signal.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 So how far do you think the transmitter...

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 It's a 1,000 watt station.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 It's got three bays.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 I think it ought to be hundreds of yards away.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 And you could maybe shield yourself from that possibly?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 Yeah.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 You can ground a big screen or a metal roof that's grounded.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 Yeah.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 There are many reasons for having a tin roof,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 but electromagnetic shielding is an important reason.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Yeah, I've noticed it does affect my phone at home and the radio reception.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 How about cinder block? Is that a block?

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 No, that doesn't do anything.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 But if you have a cinder block with a tin roof and ground tin roof,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 then you're pretty good.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 I'm not sure what the roof is in this building.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 So basically very small magnetic fields affect your cell resonance.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 Yeah.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Did you get that little news item I sent you, email?

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Yeah.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 I didn't bring it with me,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 but it looked like the exposure to the people in Poland that the study was on

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 basically doubled their cancer rate.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 Yeah, some types of cancer six or eight times.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 I think one was 13 times higher.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 Wow.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 And they said they broke it down into different age groups,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 and I don't think that was in there, what the results were.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 No, I haven't seen the article.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Just the abstract.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 Right.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 Yeah, that sounded pretty condemning of it.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 And this Englishman, Sir Richard Dahl, was denying it for a long time,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 but has now affirmed that leukemia is caused by electromagnetic fields.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 Huh.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 The story of how John Goffman went from being the government's main apologist

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 for low-level radiation in the '50s,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 he went around lecturing against Linus Pauling,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 who was warning about the dangers of fallout.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 The government took Pauling's passport away for disloyalty

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 because he wanted to protect the American public.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 And John Goffman was the AEC's counter-Linus Pauling leader.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 And he describes what happened to him.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 He says while he was giving a lecture,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 saying that if we can't prove that these low levels are causing harm to the population,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 we shouldn't.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 And at that point he realized what he had been saying for 10 years was insane.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 Yeah.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 And since then he's shifted and has become the leader of the anti-radiation movement.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 Yeah.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 But he was fired as soon as he had that moment of sanity.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 Right.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Yeah, well, there was a show on this station earlier in the week,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 and I believe they were talking about how they poison us first and then they track it.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 But that's the way the industry works.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 I think they were talking about the drug industry.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 They can get away with anything.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Yeah, food industry and drug industry and radiation and telephone industry,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 all of these industries have bought the appropriate agency of the government.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 Right.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 And then that agency basically becomes their PR arm and absorbs all their liability.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 Yeah.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 That was an interesting thing also.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 You sent another article talking about locking up all the scientific information

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 so it's not allowed to be circulated,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 that the publishers of scientific journals are charging outrageous fees

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 and trying to basically counteract, it sounds like,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 the new ability we have of correlating information with search engines.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 Mm-hmm.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 In the '90s when the economy was booming more than any economy ever in history,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 university libraries were canceling journal subscriptions,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 not just in science but hundreds of journals were canceled here at the University Library in Oregon.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 And I've heard the same sort of thing happens all across the country.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 Because of the expense?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Yeah, supposedly the expense.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 I don't know what it is that institutions like libraries are having to be cut back so radically

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 in a time of such a booming economy.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 But I used to spend every day in the library for decades

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 and my favorite journals one by one in the last several years were canceled.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 And they happened to be the journals that I most counted on

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 because they were not pushing a party line.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Yeah.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Now the library pretty much is just reinforcing the official scientific lines

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 because they've canceled so many of the journals

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 that were open to scientific discussion and criticism.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 Yeah, it sounds like they're trying to take away the public's ability

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 to review any of the information that we're getting from the government basically.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 Yeah, and the government runs Medline and the National Library of Medicine.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 I didn't know that.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 Well, now they have changed it to PubMed.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 But years ago I used to look up a given subject

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 and I would check Index Medicus,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 which was the same indexing system that became Medline and then PubMed.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 And I would check to see if they had anything that I hadn't found

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 in chemical abstracts or biological abstracts.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 And I would generally find that something that had been researched

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 for 10 or 20 or 30 years

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 and had abundant information in biological or chemical abstracts,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 there would be nothing in Index Medicus.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 And then after about 20 years,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 something might start showing up in Index Medicus.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 After the animal research had established something,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 then a generation later a little bit would show up in the medical index.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 That is slow.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 Yeah, and basically our librarian posted a sign

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 when they got a computer that would search Medline or PubMed.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 They put a big card sign on top of the monitor that said,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 "Medline is not a science database."

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 And so librarians have known that fact

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 that if you're looking for science, you don't go to Medline or PubMed.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 But even though librarians know it,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 anyone who has tried to look for information seriously finds it out very quickly.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 Several years ago, some professor wrote to a magazine,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 Townsend Letter for Doctors, that had published one of my newsletters

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 and said that he had searched Medline and couldn't find anything similar.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 And he was a university professor

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 who thought he had searched the database because he looked in Medline.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 And for professors to think that they're doing science when they look in Medline,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 it's like a brain surgeon looked in a podiatry database.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 It's just really depressing that professors think they're doing science

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 by looking on the computer for what the library of medicine has.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 Yeah, we were, Steve has been reading the Probiazin book,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 and it just sounds like what the AMA was trying to do back then

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 was basically control all of the information that was getting out about anything.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 They don't want the public to know unless they screen it first.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 Yeah, that book has, I think, the story of the fraudulent article published in JAMA

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 that they would never retract.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 Right, so it's been going on a long time.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 Yeah.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 It sounds like it's just getting more consolidated.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 You must use search engines to search on the Internet.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 Are any of the journals online?

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 Well, I subscribed for a while to a thing called Current Contents.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 A subscription to biological abstracts costs $4,000 or $7,000 a year or something like that.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 But for a few hundred dollars, you can get Current Contents,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 and you can select a broader spectrum of science journals, biology journals,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 than you get on the PubMed.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 But the only way to really do it is to go to a library that,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 if you want to only go back 30 years, libraries will have computers that go back.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 I'm not sure how far back the computers go in chemical abstracts,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 which they have good nutrition references

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 and a lot of medical references in chemical abstracts and biological abstracts.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 But if you're really going to want to know what's going on in the subject,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 you have to use the bound volumes.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 And the books are big,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 and so you get your exercise by taking down these 10-pound books.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 Yeah.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 So that stuff hasn't been edited to the computer yet?

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 No, and I don't think anyone is going to do it

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 because the whole trend is away from making information available,

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 but making people think it's available.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 Right.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 So you have the PubMed to just make you think you have access.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 Yeah.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 Stuff leaks through into PubMed,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 but it's a matter of leakage rather than being sought.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 We have a guest in the studio here, our station manager.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 I'm not sure what he's up to, but we'll let him come on.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 Oh, wait a sec. I've got to turn him on here.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 There we go.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 Can you hear me over there?

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 Yeah.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 All right.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 I've been listening to the show,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 because it's such an interesting topic,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 and at the same time so important,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 the knowing how RF affects us in our daily lives.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 When it came down to GDR and what you were asking,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 I thought, "Oh, well, I'd rather pull out our files."

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 And the station is required to go through some studies,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 and the EFCC sets the guidelines for that.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 And we go through those studies in a cycle of every four years.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 Conclusions, the above calculations show that WGDR-FM facility

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 is in compliance with the guidelines

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 with respect to areas accessible to general public.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 So that's why we have the tower gated

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 so that people won't get into the tower

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 so that then they won't start climbing up the tower

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 because the higher exposure occurs on the tower

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 as you're closer to the antenna base.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 So below that point, which is ground level,

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 and where we are even more so,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 we're safe according to the FCC guidelines

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 that they establish for measuring the type of RF exposure.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 I think what Ray is saying is that FCC guidelines perhaps

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 don't attune to the fact that cells are a little more sensitive than they think.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 But we're legal, Ray.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 Yeah, how many milliwatts did they say?

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 Zero point how many?

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 0.0327.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 That is at 7.2 meters above ground.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 Oh, above the ground.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 Right, right.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 Because that's how you would start getting closer

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 to the actual antenna base.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 Right.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 Does that reading mean anything to you?

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 Oh, knowing what it's doing at where you are

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 is the significant thing.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 You can get these little meters for $30 or $40.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 The RF meters?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 Yeah.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 Yeah.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 You can find out what it's really doing exactly where you are

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 and then compare it to power lines and the published research.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 Right.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 Of course, our government has always maintained

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 that power lines are perfectly harmless, I believe, right?

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 Yeah, but they aren't.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 If they make quails hatch, no-mail quails,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 they're definitely not harmless.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 Yeah.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 That's been known for 15 years or so,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 and the studies of power line workers

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 who have abnormal reproductive patterns,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 infertility, or not having male children,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 really the reasoning is that if it doesn't ionize you or cook you,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 then it's harmless.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 Right.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 Well, it is warm in here.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 I wonder why I was always warm even during winter, right?

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 Yeah, the heat's never on.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 I wonder why my hands would not need gloves

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 when I was working on the antenna base, right?

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 Our coffee always stays hot.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 Well, thank you as far as I go in my participation.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 I just wanted to throw my two cents in.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 Yeah, thanks for reassuring us, Carlos.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 In the short run, microwaves and radio waves can be used.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 You can touch an antenna and feel that it's warm,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 and doctors use radio waves of many different frequencies.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 Shortwave bands have, I don't know if they still do it,

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 but they used to a lot, a diathermy band,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 so that chiropractors and such could emit pretty intense signals

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 into the knees of their arthritic patients to heat the joint,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 and it would show up as a funny sound on the shortwave band.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 But they do have therapeutic value in the short run,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 but the problem is that if it's a constant factor in your life,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 it biases those subtle electronic and molecular processes,

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 the way water is organized in relation to the proteins,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 and has a chronically disorganizing influence.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Yeah.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 I know some people, I think if you talk on a cell phone for long enough,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 it gets warm.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 Is that true? Yeah?

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 Oh, yeah, then that's definitely causing biological damage,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 because the distance between the warming energy and the biologically harming range,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 once you get up in the warming range, then you know it's biologically harmful.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 I see.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 And some of the bands I've heard are much better than others.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 Some emit far less radiation than others.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 I don't know how they achieve that.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 Well, just tilting the antenna is one way to do it.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 Just move the field, basically.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 Yeah, and they found that having the antenna on your belt

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 and just the receiver connected by a wire,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 that turned out to be even worse because the field traveled up the wire

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 and got your head anyway.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 You get total coverage.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 Yeah.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 And the car phones which are wired into the car,

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 I would think that would be better.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 So, you know, you're on a speaker phone.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 Oh, yeah, I think if your antenna is outside the car,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 then that's much safer.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 Right.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 Well, you're probably driving down the freeway now, right?

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 Talking on a cell phone?

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 I should mention that beans and cell phones aren't completely unrelated subjects.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 Is that right?

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 You get some of the same kinds of damage from eating beans that you do from radiation.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 Wow.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 You actually connected the two subjects.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 I didn't think that was possible.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 So what is the similar damage to cellular?

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 Cellular communications are disrupted

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 and the immune system is the most sensitive to both of them.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 Ionizing radiation kills your white blood cells very easily,

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 but at lower levels of radiation will disrupt your immune system if they're chronic.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 And that's what the PHA and other lectins do.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 They first mess up your immune system,

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 but then gradually they will cause growth abnormalities in your liver,

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 thymus, and pancreas and intestine and different organs.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 And I was curious, on the political front,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 how you feel about the new push for nuclear power.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 They're really cranking it up here.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 Yeah, it's the same people coming back.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:09.000
 Three Mile Island wasn't the first disaster.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 Ernest Sternglass is in a league with Linus Pauling and John Goffman

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 as people who were punished by the government and the industry for telling the truth.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:37.000
 Ernest Sternglass wrote Secret Fallout, I think was the title of his first book.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 I happened to get a copy of it, but it was withdrawn from publication.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 I forget how many, it was 90% of the copies, something like that, were destroyed.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 What was it called?

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 Secret Fallout, low-level radiation.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 He came out years later with a new version of it,

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 but the book was almost completely suppressed in the first edition.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 People in the nuclear industry had seminars in which Goffman and Templin and Pauling and Sternglass

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 were the devils in which they were, without reading or allowing their employees to know anything,

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 that Sternglass or the others were saying.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 They trained, basically brainwashed their employees to say,

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 "These are stupid, incompetent people who are saying things that are not scientific."

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 But in fact, if you look at what they're saying,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 they're strictly, actually a very conservative interpretation.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 Goffman always takes the most conservative interpretation of the facts,

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 and he doesn't want to be accused of being an alarmist,

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 so he takes the most conservative scientific interpretation

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 and then says that medical x-rays cause 75% of the breast cancers.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 Yeah, that is amazing.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 And Ernest Sternglass was one of the people who studied Three Mile Island,

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 but he had been studying other reactor leaks that we never heard much about

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 and found just from ordinary emissions,

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 so-called ordinary emissions, that horrendous amounts of isotopes were being released.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 And it's the normal releases that the government allows the nuclear industry,

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 which everyone should be worried about,

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 not just the mining and the storage problems,

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:19.000
 but the legal releases that the industry is always doing.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 Yeah, I would not want to live near a nuclear plant myself.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 I don't feel like they're honest in where they communicate with the public,

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is certainly not looking out for the public interest.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 Yeah, even Linus Pauling was misled by the propagandists of the industry and the government.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 Their favorite argument was,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:59.000
 "If you fly in an airplane or live in Denver, you get so much radiation,

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 why do you want to worry about the radiation that comes from nuclear fallout or the nuclear industry?"

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 And Linus Pauling was convinced that living at high altitude or flying in an airplane

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 was carcinogenic because it increased your radiation exposure.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:28.000
 But in fact, high altitude gives you a different kind of cosmic ray.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 It increases the higher you are, the more primaries you get,

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000
 and the fewer secondaries and tertiaries.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 Basically, it's like one beam coming in producing a shower which produces another shower,

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 and the third shower is the one that's most carcinogenic,

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 and that's what happens at ground level.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000
 I see.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 So the industry was comparing totally unrelated things.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 Yeah.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 So one isotope basically produces one cancer

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 because it is 100% absorbed because it is produced inside your body.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 And I know that the nuclear industry wouldn't exist

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 if Congress hadn't passed the Price-Anderson Act, I think it was called,

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 which absolved them of all liability, or at least up to a certain point.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 And so the whole thing is just totally propped up by money and politics, I guess.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 Yeah.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.000
 Norman Solomon's newspaper column yesterday

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 was about the role of the journalism schools training liars.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 He said they used to train people in journalism to find out the truth.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 Now they're training public relations people

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.000
 to help industry and government distort the truth.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 Yeah, that makes sense.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 It seems like that's what we're getting.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 I mean, the media seems to be dropping the ball more and more.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 There are very few reporters I trust at this point.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 So I guess it pays to get your information from a variety of sources,

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 cross-reference it.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 Yeah, and your station can't have too many programs like this.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 No.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000
 But we have more than the normal radio, I think,

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 mostly just because it's individuals from the community doing shows.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 It doesn't really go through much of a screening.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 So if you're interested in something, you can do the show.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 Yeah, the government has been making its policy official

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 that community-controlled radio isn't really to be promoted.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 It's to be displaced by corporate radio.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 That's exactly right, and that's what's going on here.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 I've been trying to start a low-power radio station, which is tiny.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 It's only got a six-mile diameter, I think.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 And supposedly it was something that the last FCC commissioner,

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 Kennard, was bringing out.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 And at the last minute, believe it or not, NPR campaigned against it

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 because they were afraid it would cut into the--

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000
 well, they said they were afraid it was going to interfere

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.000
 with handicapped broadcasts, hearing impaired and stuff.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 But that was really a red herring.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 I think they're really afraid it's going to cut into the market

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 because what could be more community radio

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000
 than something within 10 miles of your home?

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 And again, speaking of radio emissions and the beans,

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 ABM is a major funder of NPR.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 What is?

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 Soybean Monopoly.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
 Oh, is that right?

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 The vitamin E and saving the world by growing soybeans advertisements.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 Wow, yeah, that's right.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 ABM, you hear that, marketplace to the world.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000
 Yeah, they seem pretty compromised, most of their reporting.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 It's pretty wishy-washy, I feel like.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 Every once in a while they have a good news report,

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 but for the most part they seem to be towing a corporate line.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 Yeah, the government and the bean monopoly

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000
 controlling radio broadcasts.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 The bean millionaires.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 I know, and we've been trying to apply for this license

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000
 for this low-power radio station down where I live,

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 and it's very hard to get a frequency.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.000
 All the frequencies have been taken up by religious stations.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 I guess if you apply for one, that takes it off the available list.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 Yeah, it's too bad someone doesn't have a religion

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000
 of true scientific information.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 That is too bad.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 Well, maybe we can start a cult.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 And that's going to have to conclude our episode of

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 Politics and Science for this week.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000
 You've been listening to Dr. Raymond Peat,

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:47.000
 interviewed back probably around 2003 at WGDR in Plainfield, Vermont,

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 on the campus of Goddard College.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 I had a radio show up there back then, a great station.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 Dr. Raymond Peat is still teaching.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 He's out in Eugene, Oregon.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 You can reach him through his website, Raypeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T dot com.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000
 He has 90 articles or so there, newsletters,

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 and you can research the issues that are important to you

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.000
 by using the Google search option on his web page.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 Thanks for listening, everyone.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000
 I hope you have a great week, and please tune in again next week

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 for another edition of Politics and Science.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.180
