00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Okay.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 [music]

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Broadcasting from the beautiful Hill Country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Okay, we're calling Dr. Ray Peat now, and I think we're all connected with him, and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 we're going to do it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.240
 Dr. Ray Peat is a PhD in biology, University of Oregon, specialization in physiology.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.200
 He's taught schools all over the place, University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.960
 National College, Naturopathic Medicine.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.840
 He started years ago with progesterone-related hormones, 1968, and he's been working in

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.320
 both practical and theoretical aspects of all this work that he does, which has been

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.480
 a very, very long time.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.520
 I believe it's about 85 years around the sun.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.080
 I believe that's what he said.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.080
 Dr. Peat, good morning.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.080
 Good morning.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.080
 How are you doing?

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 Very good.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.080
 Are you really 85 revolutions around the sun?

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 No, no.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.080
 Yesterday I saw a thing on the internet saying I'm 83, but I'm really only 82.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.080
 Oh, 82.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 Oh, gosh.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.000
 You mean we can't believe everything that we read on the internet?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 One place said I was 114.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 That's right.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 This guy's been around so long, man.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 He's 114.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 He's 114.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:43.080
 Who are some of your real heroes in the field of health and nutrition and healing?

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.080
 Dr. Peat, the work that you do, some real heroes for you.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:59.200
 Oh, I read lots of old books that the family had, early 20th century and mid-19th century

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.200
 even.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:09.080
 Lots of the people were not very well known, but there was a lot of good information in

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:18.240
 the medical culture that was pushed aside starting around the Second World War.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.960
 The pharmaceutical industry really took over medicine.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:31.880
 For example, one of my early interests was a doctor who wrote columns in the newspapers

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.880
 for many years, Walter C. Alvarez, a gastroenterologist.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.320
 He was, in a way, pushing a conventional line.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:56.760
 For example, in the 19th century, doctors believed in food digestion poisoning, bacterial

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.960
 poisoning in the intestine.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:07.520
 He wanted to disprove that, showing that toxins didn't cause headaches.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:20.000
 So to show that it was just a myth, nothing very subtle or chemical, he stuffed his medical

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.320
 students' rectums with cotton wads.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:33.800
 All of those who were susceptible to headaches got a headache just from the cotton pressure.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:43.360
 He said that this disproves the idea that headaches are caused by toxicity in the intestine.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.920
 But of course, that didn't logically prove anything, just that pressure is enough, and

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.000
 toxins often lead to pressure in the intestine.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.040
 A lot of Russians were showing the interaction of the nervous system with the intestine around

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.240
 that same time.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:19.480
 Nervism was a 19th century concentration or theory of medicine in Russia.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:27.160
 They saw the nervous system as controlling sickness, and so the interaction of the digestive

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.440
 system and the brain was a big topic of research in Russia.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.480
 They showed that if you put a balloon in an animal's intestine and inflated it, nothing

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.920
 would happen if the animal's blood sugar was good.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.960
 But if you lowered the blood sugar and inflated the intestine, then it would cause all kinds

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:02.720
 of things, like asthma, seizures, the equivalent of headache, vascular distortions all through

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.160
 the organism.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:14.480
 So the combination of energy in the form of blood sugar and stress in the intestine will

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:22.320
 cause that whole range of so-called psychosomatic ailments.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:34.160
 Some French Canadians following Hans Selye showed that the immune system similarly interacts

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:42.360
 with the intestine and the energy supply, that if you drop the blood glucose level,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:50.680
 the intestine becomes extremely sensitive to allergens that otherwise wouldn't be noticed.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:06:01.680
 So the energy and the brain, which has the highest requirement for glucose as its energy

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:11.560
 source, these are behind the psychosomatic and allergic ailments.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.800
 So it's fair to say then there's so many different components in the nervous system

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:27.080
 and everything, the way we think and all that, that are contributing to all the gut issues

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.000
 that are out there today.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.560
 Blood sugar.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:40.480
 Yeah, about 20, 30 years ago, some psychologists were demonstrating that helplessness, learned

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:51.280
 helplessness, training the brain to believe that escape is impossible, made the whole

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.440
 organism shut down.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:01.820
 The heart would stop beating in a few minutes rather than a few hours if the animal was

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.080
 convinced that escape was possible.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:15.400
 So the whole organism is either energized or shut down by the perspective that's possible.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.960
 So insight becomes a life-saving matter.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:27.320
 So wow, you can extrapolate that out, Dr. Peat, and just think all the things physiologically

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.760
 going on with people who are feeling trapped in their life or trapped in their job or their

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.440
 relationship or just trapped on planet Earth and don't have a good sense of why they're

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.520
 here, that kind of thing.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.120
 What kind of factors that would play on their physical health?

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.360
 Yeah, I've seen that happen just with medical diagnosis.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:57.120
 The doctor tells a person that they have an incurable disease and they pretty soon die.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:03.280
 Is it any surprise to you after all these years that we're so inextricably connected

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.160
 with everything that we think and believe and feel along with all the other factors?

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.800
 I mean, is it surprising to you that this thing was all wired up like this?

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.480
 No, no.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.200
 It makes sense, really, I guess.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:29.720
 I never was committed to any particular so-called scientific view of the world.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:39.000
 And it all seemed perfectly reasonable to a perfectly ignorant kid looking at the world

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.040
 and hearing these different experiments.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:55.680
 So, the so-called scientific medicine always seemed like a closed dogmatic way of seeing

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.680
 things.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:02.280
 Were they just looking at things in parts or taking the brain apart and saying, "Well,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.120
 this is how the brain works," that kind of thing?

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.120
 Yeah.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:16.680
, and since about the 1940s, the pharmaceutical industry has shaped medical ideas so that

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:23.420
 it's really an outlet for their products.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:30.160
 You get a diagnosis and then you can funnel the drugs in.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:39.960
 And anything curative, like the old medical practice of giving people bran to cure constipation,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:50.240
 like the Kellogg Institute, that isn't profitable to the pharmaceutical industry.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.440
 Isn't that how the Kellogg's guy started?

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.440
 Didn't he had a whole thing about constipation?

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.440
 Yeah.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.320
 What's the guy's name?

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.880
 I don't remember his first name, but Kellogg.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.880
 Kellogg, yeah.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.880
 Yeah.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.720
 So, his whole thing was constipation, wasn't it?

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.720
 Yeah.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:17.840
 And in the mid-19th century in England and France, the autopsy cause of death was often

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.120
 given as inflammation of the intestine.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:32.520
 But now, I think they see that just as often, but having an inflamed colon is a very common

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:38.680
 thing in a dying person, but they don't think of it as the cause of death.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:45.240
 Oh, because everything begins to shut down and they don't go to the bathroom much at

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.240
 all?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.240
 Yeah.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:53.280
 There's people like Walter Alvarez who said, "See, it isn't toxins causing a headache.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.280
 It's just the pressure."

00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:04.440
 And that took attention away from the intestine as a constant source of toxins and allergens,

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:12.760
 but it's really our most susceptible interface with the outside world.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.880
 We're constantly putting these risky substances into our system.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.960
 Risky substances, I like the way you say it.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.480
 So that's why some folks, you've heard over the years, where they get constipated and

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:32.000
 they get a headache, and those two tend to go together.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.960
 Oh, sure.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.680
 And asthma attacks and seizures.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:47.800
 When I was about 10, our dog found a coffee can full of bacon grease that had been saved

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.560
 to make soap.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:56.120
 The dog liked the taste and ate the whole quart of bacon grease and had a seizure.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.640
 And that started me.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:08.600
 I think that was what made Walter Alvarez's publication so interesting, to see a seizure

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.440
 brought on by eating fat.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:20.560
 I saw that lots of people had experimented showing that the intestine could trigger a

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:29.680
 seizure or headache or runny nose, sore throat, just about any symptom you can think of can

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.820
 be triggered from the intestine.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.840
 So the dog just had so much he just couldn't deal with all that fat.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.840
 Yeah.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.480
 Because it was probably generally pretty good for him, but not that whole can, right?

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.480
 Yeah.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.480
 Wow.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.480
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.960
 If you have a question, comment, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.240
 This is kind of an interesting one from Dennis.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:58.000
 He said, "I've just heard so much about this classic quote-unquote autoimmune issue.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.840
 Could Dr. Peat give us his theory on this autoimmune problem that people keep talking

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.200
 about?"

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:18.840
 For a long time, people noticed that women have far more autoimmune problems than men.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:29.680
 We know about five times the incidence of thyroid disease and there's a very close connection.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.280
 Estrogen sensitizes your immune system.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.960
 It acts on your brain and your glucose supply.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:45.760
 For example, it activates insulin secretion, but it shifts your metabolism away from glucose

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:55.920
 towards fat oxidation and that makes you less able to oxidize glucose, turning it to carbon

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.240
 dioxide.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:04.400
 In the absence of the high production of carbon dioxide, you produce lactic acid.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:17.320
 Lactic acid promotes inflammation and starting with the fact that estrogen slows liver function

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:29.240
 by reducing the thyroid hormone, the slowed liver production shifts you into that lactate-favoring

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:39.680
 metabolism away from carbon dioxide and lactate causes inflammation of everything.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:47.000
 Autoimmune thyroid disease is just sort of the tip of the iceberg.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.320
 Once the estrogen slows your thyroid down and starts inflammation there, then all of

00:14:53.320 --> 00:15:02.360
 your other tissues are susceptible to chronic inflammation, ultimately leading to calcification

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:08.640
 or fibrosis, excess collagen production.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:15.960
 All this is cascading starting from high estrogen levels?

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:26.400
 In a normal cycle of two or three days, there's a surge of estrogen around ovulation.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:36.840
 Then if they're healthy, well-fed, the ovary shifts strongly to progesterone production.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:43.440
 The diagrams in medical books often show estrogen and progesterone on the same chart and they

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.480
 use a different scale.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:50.640
 The production of progesterone is about a thousand times greater than production of

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:59.600
 estrogen in a healthy person, but they show them on the same graph misleadingly.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:09.000
 This little moment of dominant estrogen should be suppressed by a massive pouring out of

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.040
 progesterone for the rest of the month.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:26.680
 If anything interferes, like if they eat too much vegetable oil or too much starchy vegetables,

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:39.040
 things that are hard to digest, their energy level decreases so that they don't produce

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.760
 the normal amount of progesterone, it starts with a premenstrual syndrome where they don't

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:59.280
 have the energy and sense of well-being of the progesterone-controlled condition.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:06.360
 In the absence of progesterone, everything tends to shift in an inefficient direction

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:16.000
 towards oxidation of fat rather than of glucose, and that takes a lot more oxygen.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.760
 Every carbon requires two oxygens if it's fat and only one oxygen if it's carbohydrate,

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.880
 which already comes with one oxygen.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:34.720
 So you get a double supply of carbon dioxide in effect when you're using sugar as a fuel.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:44.040
 The carbon dioxide has a stabilizing protective effect that suppresses inflammation and turns

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.680
 off lactate production.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.840
 Wow.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:57.400
 So a lot of ladies could have a hard time going through their periods, and if they really

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.700
 could be eating some foods that are causing the things to be worse feeling, and if they

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.560
 maybe change their diet, if they could figure it out, they could feel better during this

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.560
 time.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.560
 Is that what I heard you say?

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.560
 Yeah.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:19.880
 In the short run, eating a lot of carbohydrate will make them feel better because it'll provide

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.560
 lots of glucose.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.760
 Eating rice and bread and vegetables, for example, in the short run can make a person

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.920
 feel euphoric.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:39.840
 But at some point, their liver needs a good supply of protein to keep working.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:49.840
 Women who have been on a diet for a long time, I've seen women eating 15 or 20 grams of protein

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:59.640
 a day where an army study found that even average or small women to work efficiently

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.680
 even at office work needed 100 grams of protein a day.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:14.720
 And women often are told that 35 grams a day is fine, but all of the really competent studies

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:23.800
 show that 85 to 100 or more grams per day are needed for the liver to function well,

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.200
 for the brain to work properly.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:34.320
 So just a protein deficiency makes the liver underproduce.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:45.560
 In the 1940s, some people did studies on the prisoners, war prisoners who were starved.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:52.320
 They noticed that when they were let out of the prison camps and given some good food

00:19:52.320 --> 00:20:00.720
 or at least more food, the men fairly often grew breasts in the first year after getting

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.720
 out of prison.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:06.920
 And they found that that was because their liver had been damaged from the prolonged

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.920
 protein and vitamin deficiency.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:21.240
 And the liver normally destroys or it causes excretion of 100% of the estrogen reaching

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.360
 it.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:30.160
 And so if you starve the liver for the B vitamins or protein in particular, the estrogen accumulates

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:37.480
 so a man will grow breasts just from a prolonged nutrient deficiency.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:48.520
 And that happens in women and that's a basic cause of premenstrual syndrome.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:21:03.400
 And the misinterpretation of what happens premenstrually, the estrogen industry starting

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:11.720
 in the 1940s when they had a product to sell, they convinced the government first of all

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:22.720
 and the public that these PMS problems and menopausal problems were the result of deficiency

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.840
 of estrogen rather than an excess.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:33.640
 At the very same time, the researchers were showing exactly how the liver keeps estrogen

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.080
 under control when your diet is good.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:41.440
 But the estrogen industry totally reversed that situation.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:51.760
 They even sold estrogen to prevent miscarriage all through the late 40s and 50s.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:57.800
 Doctors at Harvard were convincing doctors throughout the country to prescribe estrogen

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.520
 to pregnant women.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:08.120
 That created the DES syndrome, cancer in the next generation.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:17.280
 The babies who were exposed in utero to that estrogen supposedly to prevent miscarriage,

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:22.680
 they developed estrogen problems later in life.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.360
 And wasn't that whole syndrome, wasn't it blamed on some drug or something?

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.960
 Yeah, diethylstilbestrol, synthetic estrogen.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.520
 Oh, so that was the cause.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:46.080
 Yeah, in the 1930s, my professor for example, Sodervall, was a student of one of the people

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:52.920
 who showed very early that estrogen causes miscarriage.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:58.320
 My professor gave animals graded doses.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.640
 One animal would get a small dose, another a bigger dose.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:08.920
 He showed that the number of miscarriages exactly corresponded to the dose of estrogen

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.240
 they were getting.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:20.080
 So estrogen as a contraceptive or abortion producer was defined before 1940, but it was

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:27.620
 1941 and '42 when the estrogen industry started promoting it to prevent miscarriage exactly

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:32.440
 180 degrees opposite of what it does.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:41.680
 And so that has created more than 50 years of total confusion about what estrogen does.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:48.160
 For 50 years, they prescribed estrogen to men with prostate cancer.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:56.640
 It turns out that it is a major cause of prostate cancer, but it was given to men to treat their

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:09.560
 prostate cancer and it would cause death from asthma, blood clotting, seizures, accelerated

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.920
 cancer in other organs and so on.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:21.520
 In fact, if you look at a man's testosterone, the high testosterone men in middle and old

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.800
 age are relatively free of prostate cancer.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:35.120
 The ones who develop prostate cancer are the ones with lower testosterone and more effective

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.120
 of the estrogen.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.120
 Dr. Rehbert: That is fascinating.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:43.080
 Dr. Ray Peat, I'm going to do a little break here, but before that, on the protein, you

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.960
 talked about the ladies and the protein, the lack of.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:54.000
 Does it matter to balance this out if they did animal protein or other forms of protein

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.680
 like rice protein or whey protein or some of vegetable protein?

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:03.640
 Do you think that matters in what you're talking about the protein in the ladies and the PMS?

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:10.840
 Dr. Peat Yeah, it does, but I'm not sure how to rank

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.360
 those different proteins.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:25.400
 Gelatin is one protein that is very safe because it lacks the three amino acids which can be

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:31.560
 very toxic if you're eating more than is needed.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:42.320
 They happen to be used for growth, so they're needed until you're about 20 or 25 years old.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:47.440
 They're used for expanding the body tissues.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:56.520
 After that, they're just needed for replacing skin and the cells that are turning over rapidly

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:07.520
 need cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan, but if you eat the young person's requirement

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:17.160
 of those amino acids when you're 40 or 50, they tend to promote overgrowth, promoting

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:24.240
 inflammation, excite a toxicity of the nerves, and promote tumor growth.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:30.000
 So they're associated with shortening the lifespan.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:37.960
 Gelatin lacks those, so it's a very safe protein that can be added to those other proteins

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.280
 to balance it out and give you a mature person's protein requirement.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.920
 Dr. Nelson Oh, you mean like the Great Lakes gelatin or

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.920
 that kind of product?

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.840
 Dr. Peat Yeah, that's a good one that I've used a

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.840
 lot.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:56.480
 Dr. Nelson Okay, so they don't have the three that we

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.480
 don't need?

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:07.480
 Dr. Peat Yeah, gelatin is used as basically the stiffening

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:14.720
 glue that holds our other cells together, and it tends to increase with age.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:23.240
 You won't increase your rate of collagen production by eating gelatin.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:33.360
 It just serves to prevent the unnecessary stimulation of tissue growth.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:39.520
 A lot of people are selling gelatin, calling it collagen.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.080
 Collagen is the raw form in your tissues.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:54.080
 To buy actual collagen costs something like $10 a gram, because it can't be purified in

00:27:54.080 --> 00:28:00.280
 a sterile form without great lab processing.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.280
 Dr. Nelson I see.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.360
 So if you're going to really want collagen, you should just get collagen from, I don't

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.080
 know, pig's feet and all the cam hocks and stuff like that, huh?

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.080
 Chicken?

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.080
 Dr. Peat Yeah, that's natural.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.040
 Wait, wait a minute.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:23.280
 Chicken backs and wings and feet, for example, are the traditional ways to, when a person

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:30.080
 is sick, they found that giving them gelatinous chicken soup is therapeutic.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.480
 Dr. Nelson And so one of the reasons is the collagen and

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.080
 all the good things, the amino acids and things that they have?

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:43.160
 Dr. Peat Yeah, and the absence of those excitatory

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.000
 amino acids is part of its benefit.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.200
 Dr. Nelson And the excitatory again are what, glycine?

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:53.200
 Dr. Peat No, glycine is the quieting.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:29:00.680
 It can be used in the brain as part of excitation, but its normal function, and proline, these

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:07.800
 are the two protective energy-providing and stabilizing amino acids.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:14.560
 The ones that can be excitotoxic are tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:19.400
 Dr. Nelson And if we just eat animal products, we're

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.120
 getting those in there, Dr. Peat, right?

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.640
 They're already in there in the meats?

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.640
 Dr. Peat Yeah.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.840
 Dr. Nelson Okay.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:31.240
 But so if you take extra stuff, you don't want to take the ones that have those in there

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.400
 because you can get kind of too wound up?

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.880
 Dr. Peat Yeah.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:49.360
 The different vegetable proteins vary quite a bit, so you could combine some of them with

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.160
 gelatin to get an optimal balance.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.160
 Dr. Nelson Oh, I see.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.280
 You can add a little gelatin in there too.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.280
 Cool.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.280
 Stay right there.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.640
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.640
 Patrick Timpani.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.960
 We have a lot of good emails coming in, and we're going to get to them all, and he'll

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.240
 answer your questions the best he can.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.280
 We appreciate him coming on from time to time.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.800
 If you like him, he's one of your faves out there.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.280
 Patrick@1radionetwork.com, raypeat.com.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.120
 You can sign up for a newsletter that Dr. Peat has.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.760
 It's a very, very nominal fee for a couple of years.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:26.000
 I'll ask him what the price is again, but I know it's really, really, really low.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.920
 It's raypeat.com, and that's where you can find him.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:35.640
 Dr. Richard Ulrey, authority on minerals, talks about gut bacteria, making the vitamins,

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.360
 and absorbing the minerals, how it all works.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:44.040
 We need vitamins from our gut bacteria so we can absorb minerals, and then minerals

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.000
 provide a resonant frequency.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.640
 Those minerals carry these frequencies into the body, and multiple minerals will give

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:58.120
 you a frequency that allows all of our proteins to have individual distinct frequencies, giving

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.880
 that three-dimensional structure.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:05.780
 This is where Wayne's products, Living Stream, and that's the only primary products I carry.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:10.720
 When you do a stool test and it says you don't have any bifalbacteria, well, if you don't

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.840
 have any bifalbacteria, you're not going to absorb certain minerals.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.840
 If you don't have any lactobacillus, you're not going to absorb certain minerals.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.600
 Here's an idea of a couple of the Living Streams you can take for what we're talking about

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.600
 here.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:29.280
 The bifido, Living Streams Multi-Blend, and the living minerals, so you get the minerals,

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.680
 the bifido, and the lactobacillus.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:37.520
 These special probiotics and minerals are all in human DNA form, and they are living

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.160
 alive.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.560
 In our store on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:48.160
 Previously with Dr. Rue Lynn Chiu about her product called Pearlseum.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.040
 Let's talk about the teeth first.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.320
 Explain to me what's going on, because there's something magical when you dip your little

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.320
 toothbrush in water.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:01.680
 Why do they look so sparkly and just, I don't know, something very energetically about the

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.680
 look of them.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.040
 Yeah, it's very, very magical.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:12.520
 So like a group of scientists in France discovered that when you put pearl next to the bones

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:18.200
 or skins or other connective tissues, and they find it stimulates new growth of the

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:25.720
 bones and skins and connective tissues, and also to make existing bones and skins more

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.680
 healthy and stronger.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:35.080
 So brush your teeth with the pearl, then your teeth will make your existing teeth stronger,

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:42.120
 and also it will fill up teeth with the pearlseum, and the pearl powder will stimulate the new

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:46.840
 bone growth and also make the existing teeth very strong.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.000
 It's really a great product.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 You'll love it.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Take it internally or on your teeth, and you can click and order.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.720
 See the ad right there.

 You don't have to have special shoes.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.440
 You generally can't hurt yourself unless you fall off.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.240
 It's one of the coolest ways to exercise.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.200
 I've been using it for 25 years or so.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:33.120

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:43.440
 Ray Peat has come back a few times, and you like him.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.160
 We appreciate Dr. Peat coming on from time to time and chatting with us.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.160
 It's fun to talk to you.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.160
 I love all the research.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.240
 This is a great question from Jeremy.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.160
 I just love eggs.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.040
 I might eat maybe three, four a day.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.040
 Is it okay?

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.000
 I mean, are these great food?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.200
 What does Dr. Peat think?

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.200
 All right.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.760
 Well, they used to say it was a perfect food.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.760
 Remember the commercials?

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:16.120
 Yeah, they used to be the perfect food.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:27.680
 I've seen the cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acid content analyzed in the 30s, the

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:37.200
 50s, the 70s, and then recently there has been a constant decrease in cholesterol content

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:41.960
 and a constant increase in polyunsaturated fat content.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.960
 Because of the feed?

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:43.960
 The feed?

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:53.200
 Yeah, they're feeding them so efficiently in the energy sense.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:59.920
 In the pork industry in the 40s, they found that the highly polyunsaturated fats made

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:06.120
 the pig gain fat faster with less food.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:13.680
 And so, they shifted from the higher protein and starch foods to the higher polyunsaturated

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.560
 fats.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:22.680
 Saturated fats also wasted energy so the pigs stayed lean.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:31.320
 That spread over to the other branches of agriculture and chicken feed has become more

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.320
 and more polyunsaturated.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:39.360
 So, let's say though a lot of our listeners have access to really good eggs, the real

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:45.400
 good yard eggs and even feed that doesn't have soy and it's all organic at the farmers'

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.400
 markets.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.640
 Now, if you're getting a really good egg like that, is it a perfect food then?

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:57.960
 Yeah, when I'm in Mexico and know where the eggs come from, the chickens get tortillas

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:07.040
 and vegetables and lots of bugs and so on, then I'll eat four or five eggs a day and

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.200
 it's okay to eat more.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:17.560
 One person was in the news, he's eaten a dozen eggs a day for 40 years or something like

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.560
 that.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.760
 No kidding, yeah, yeah.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:29.400
 The cholesterol myth was created by the seed oil industry, especially cottonseed people

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:35.160
 wanted to sell their product on the basis that it lowered cholesterol and things that

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:41.080
 lower cholesterol generally cause cancer and degenerative disease.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:51.360
 But in an experiment many years ago, medical students were fed, I think it was 22 eggs

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:56.960
 was the point at which they could show an increase in their serum cholesterol.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:04.560
 At 15 eggs a day, there was no increase because their natural liver production of cholesterol

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:12.680
 was inhibited when they were eating it as if the body recognizes that it doesn't have

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:18.280
 to make cholesterol when it's getting the amount in 15 eggs.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:25.240
 The studies that showed the increase of serum cholesterol from eggs, the first ones were

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:31.040
 done in diabetic, hospitalized, very sick patients.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:37.720
 But when you look at healthy young people, you need lots and lots of eggs with no change

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.960
 in your blood cholesterol level.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:45.240
 There was a fellow that used to promote a kind of a live food diet, Agnes von der Planets,

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:49.400
 and he claimed that he worked with people over the years that they really had bad stomach

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:54.880
 problems that he would just have them do like a dozen raw eggs a day for a week and it usually

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.080
 straightened things out.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.080
 It's pretty strange.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.880
 Have you ever heard about that?

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:07.160
 Yeah, I've seen several people, one a year and a half old kid, the second one was a man

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.760
 about 70 years old.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:17.600
 Both of them had a diagnosis of leukemia and somewhere I had heard about the effect of

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:23.040
 egg on the leukemia virus or something related to leukemia.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:30.680
 So I suggested an eggnog, sort of an Orange Julius formula, egg, milk, sugar, orange juice

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.720
 or vanilla.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:43.480
 And both of these first two people who tried it had a recovery, no more leukemia symptoms.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:50.200
 So over the years, I've suggested that several times for lymphoma and leukemia in particular,

00:38:50.200 --> 00:39:00.000
 but in general, it's just you don't have to make it your exclusive diet, but having an

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.080
 Orange Julius once in a while is very good for your health.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.080
 Yeah, yeah.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:09.240
 A big difference between raw or cooking the eggs, do we think?

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:16.640
 Oh, yeah, there have been experiments that show that something in the raw egg yolk is

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:24.880
 germicidal and helps to disinfect the intestine, which somewhat is decreased by cooking it,

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:29.800
 but still you get almost all the benefit from a cooked egg.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:37.880
 But it's better to cook it as little as possible so that the yolk is still runny because the

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:45.140
 presence of the polyunsaturated fat makes it very easily oxidized and damaged by heat.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:50.720
 You mentioned pigs and when we speak about these, let's say we're talking about really

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:55.960
 well tended, well fed, well cared for pigs and not just commercial, right?

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:56.960
 Big difference.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:03.440
 So if we can get this kind of a product, any issues in your mind with pork?

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:12.680
 Yeah, but for about 50 years, the Department of Agriculture called lard a saturated fat.

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:21.120
 They hadn't checked their figures since the 1930s, but a more recent study showed that

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:29.440
 it's, I think it was 32 or 33% polyunsaturated fats in lard.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:36.360
 So it ranks up with the worst of the liquid oils for oxidizability.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:44.280
 When I was a kid, grocery stores would have blocks of lard sitting out at room temperature

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.920
 just like a lump of butter.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:54.960
 But recently I saw lard in a plastic bag looking like a liquid fat.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.960
 Oh boy.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.800
 And what was that made out of, that stuff?

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.240
 That shows the change of diet on the fat.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:15.200
 When the source of energy is mostly starch and protein, the animal turns it into mostly

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.200
 saturated fat.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.200
 Oh, real good stuff.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.200
 It's good stuff.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:23.560
 Yeah, solid lard, which stimulates your metabolism rather than poisoning it.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:27.320
 I see, I see.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:36.440
 If you are eating a vegetable fat, if it grows in the tropics, it'll be more saturated because

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:42.400
 the temperature of the organism governs the saturation of the fats that it makes.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:50.280
 So chocolate, for example, cocoa butter grown in the tropics is highly saturated.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:59.680
 Liquid oil is highly saturated because the polyunsaturated fats are extremely unstable

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:05.280
 at 90 degrees or 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which is our body temperature.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:12.480
 So the plants that produce those fats would die if they were producing polyunsaturated

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:18.920
 fats because they would simply die of oxygen reaction poisoning.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.440
 Oh wow.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.680
 Patrick Timpone, Ray Peat, it's April 29, 2019.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.680
 Here's an email.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:30.360
 Can Mr. Peat recommend any kind of foods or supplements that could help someone recovering

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:36.400
 from long-term inflammatory bowel disease, cause hair loss, sharp drop in lean body mass,

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:46.280
 skin that doesn't seem to heal, and for minor cuts, scrapes, and bruises?

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:57.000
 The avoiding the things that produce inflammation and those are the basic thing that amplifies

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:09.560
 and sustains inflammation are the polyunsaturated fats and the bacteria that feed on indigestible

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.820
 plant matter.

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:19.400
 We don't have enzymes to break down cellulose and lignin and the woody fibers in plants.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:29.880
 And so if starches and fats are associated with those indigestible polysaccharides, then

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:38.040
 they will be protected against our digestive system and feed bacteria in the lower intestine

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:45.320
 and cause the absorption of bacterial toxins, endotoxin and others.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:56.080
 And so for example, lettuce, if you eat it in a salad, it's going to be an ideal bacteria

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.080
 food.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:04.320
 So if you have a tough intestine, you can stand the growth of the bacteria, but if you're

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:13.240
 at all prone to inflammation, then lettuce or other undercooked vegetables are going

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:17.720
 to feed the bacteria that produce bowel inflammation.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:28.560
 And so overcooked vegetables are actually more nutritious than raw or partly cooked

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:29.560
 vegetables.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:38.280
 An experiment with rats showed that even rats can't live on raw vegetables as an exclusive

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:45.280
 diet, but they thrived on canned vegetables that are overcooked.

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:52.440
 So this could be the reason why some people just don't do that well on raw foods.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.560
 Yeah.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:45:06.000
 And especially if you have colitis, a milk and egg diet, for example, is often therapeutic

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 for colitis.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 Very interesting.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:16.840
 Here's a fellow, "Mom recently underwent mastectomy to remove a lump and they prescribed

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.120
 an anti-estrogen medication.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.400
 It caused a severe reaction.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:26.360
 A lot of muscle pain, bone pain, nausea, dizziness."

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:32.240
 Can Mr. Peek give his opinion of what could be going on here with mom?

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:39.460
 The anti-estrogen drugs have many effects other than suppressing estrogen.

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:47.180
 You can powerfully decrease estrogen production, inhibiting aromatase.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:59.440
 If you thoroughly cut out polyunsaturated fats and use aspirin and other natural substances

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:06.880
 are the things that block the production of estrogen.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:18.020
 Aspirin is just one of the natural substances blocking aromatase and it's very safe to use

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.340
 in breast cancer.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.460
 Progesterone is another.

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:29.620
 There are several plant-derived substances that are inhibitors of aromatase, but cutting

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:39.380
 out the polyunsaturated fats, they produce prostaglandins and the prostaglandins are

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:46.500
 the main force activating aromatase and estrogen production.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.800
 Excellent.

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:52.740
 This is a fellow in Switzerland.

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:59.500
 His father had cancer in the oral tissues.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:06.300
 Now he's free from cancer, but the x-rays have caused bone necrosis in his jaw.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.300
 Anything that he could do from this x-ray damage?

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:13.260
 Can x-ray damage actually cause bone necrosis?

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.020
 Yeah.

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:27.020
 About 30 or 40 years ago, I noticed that I was getting a circle of white whiskers and

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:38.540
 I realized that that circle represented where the x-ray gun had been used to make dental

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:39.540
 x-rays.

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:40.540
 Wow.

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:49.660
 Right after that, each time I had dental x-rays, I would get leukoplasia on the inside

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:55.380
 of my cheek that would swell up and get bitten accidentally.

00:47:55.380 --> 00:48:03.980
 That would clear up when I eventually got enough vitamin A, but the x-ray destroys first

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:13.980
 the vitamin A and E and vitamin B2, the things that are light sensitive are the first to

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:22.060
 be destroyed by even low dose x-ray or ultraviolet light.

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:29.020
 These essential growth factors, regulatory factors, are destroyed in the bone because

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:39.380
 the x-ray penetrates pretty well even into the bone.

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:45.740
 Getting your essential nutrients up would be the first defense.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:54.860
 Vitamin D and calcium are the first anti-inflammatory and restorative things, especially for the

00:48:54.860 --> 00:49:03.780
 bone and keeping the cortisol and prolactin down.

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:12.980
 Besides the vitamin D and calcium effect, which tend to lower prolactin and cortisol,

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:20.740
 having your energy coming from carbohydrates rather than fats is protective.

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:28.900
 Again, the aspirin effect keeps the prostaglandin production down.

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:36.420
 An anti-inflammatory program protects against bone loss as well as cancer.

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:37.420
 Excellent.

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:44.300
 I know that Dr. Peat considers estrogen kind of pro-aging.

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:49.340
 If high testosterone, for example, gives a man attractive traits like strong, muscular,

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:55.420
 deep voice, and courage and all of that, then high estrogen woman is usually the one with

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:59.380
 attractive broad hips, large breasts, and narrow waist.

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:05.180
 Being an artist, what does Dr. Peat think about estrogen as a factor in female physical attractiveness?

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:08.820
 That's an interesting question.

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:20.900
 It does increase the fat on the thighs and hips when everything else is in good balance,

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:25.540
 and it's one of the essential things for breast growth.

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:35.660
 But if it comes at the wrong time and in the wrong place, it's also a masculinizing factor.

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:44.340
 It will shift the balance in an embryo towards male development rather than female.

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:53.580
 It's progesterone which protects the female against the masculinizing effects of estrogen.

00:50:53.580 --> 00:51:03.980
 You have to have a generous supply of progesterone to keep down the cortisol, which is promoted

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:08.620
 by estrogen.

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:15.100
 If you give an animal a large dose of estrogen, the first thing you're likely to see is bleeding

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:22.020
 adrenal glands because they're so overstimulated trying to make more cortisol to balance the

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:27.780
 estrogen that it will destroy the adrenals if the estrogen is very high.

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:41.620
 But short of that, it raises your cortisol and related stress hormones, and the circulating

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:46.100
 free fatty acids are increased by estrogen.

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:53.380
 So when the estrogen isn't blocked by progesterone, you get these stress syndromes, including

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:54.380
 belly fat.

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.460
 Dr. Ray Peat's with us.

00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.140
 Here's an interesting question.

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:06.420
 I have a 10-year-old daughter, very close to entering puberty, poor appetite, skinny,

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:12.260
 has some dental issues, tendency to be tired and cold, very emotionally sensitive for any

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:15.140
 drama, watching movies.

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:20.020
 Apart from general love and support, could Dr. Peat offer any kind of ideas, could be

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:25.780
 a good strategy to help to get her going?

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:29.740
 And should we have our thyroid or steroid hormones measured?

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:36.220
 Yeah, it's good to check her temperature and pulse rate and see how they compare with

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:37.940
 kids of that age.

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:46.500
 But as the estrogen starts rising after the age of six, especially nine, 10, and 11, the

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:51.820
 estrogen is blocking the thyroid gland.

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:59.460
 In teenage girls, you often see a puffiness at the bottom of the neck, which indicates

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:07.260
 that the thyroid gland is producing something, but it isn't secreting the active hormone.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:11.460
 So the gland enlarges under the influence of estrogen.

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:21.020
 And girls often have a crease above and below where the thyroid is because of that puffing

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.020
 effect.

00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:29.140
 Boys of the same age don't have creases in those areas because it's very common for the

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:36.340
 pubescent girl to have the bulging thyroid gland because the gland is trying to produce

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:41.500
 the hormone, but it isn't able to release it into the bloodstream.

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:52.780
 And that will be detectable in the blood if the doctor knows how to recognize the indicators.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:59.340
 Vitamin D and calcium work closely with the thyroid and sugar metabolism.

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:09.620
 It's been pretty much ignored that vitamin D is connected to energy and sugar metabolism,

00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:18.300
 but your thyroid can't work properly if you're low in vitamin D and calcium.

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:26.220
 And so getting lots of milk and cheese and eggs is important.

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:33.820
 But a lot of the high phosphate foods like nuts, beans, and meats, a moderate amount

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:44.140
 of those, but plenty of leafy vegetables, well-cooked cheese, eggs, and milk, and probably

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:51.420
 a supplement of vitamin D unless you're able to get hours of sunlight on a lot of your

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:52.420
 skin every day.

00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:53.420
 Those are some good ideas.

00:54:53.420 --> 00:55:02.300
 On the 29th of April, I would like to know Dr. Peat's opinion on using the pure pine

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:05.300
 gum spirits or turpentine internally.

00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:11.820
 Does he have any opinion about the good, bad, or the ugly with using that?

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:21.740
 I've known lots of people who used it, and it isn't as dangerous as a lot of doctors

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:30.060
 will lead you to believe, but you do have to be careful with it because it can in itself

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.380
 be irritating.

00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:41.460
 I always painted with it, enjoyed the smell of it, and felt it was very harmless, maybe

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:49.940
 beneficial, but the research has been biased against it by the funding from the pharmaceutical

00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:54.140
 industry that has something fancier to sell.

00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:55.620
 Here's an email.

00:55:55.620 --> 00:56:01.220
 Is it okay to take bioidentical hormones as long as they are balanced if one has breast

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:06.900
 cancer, ER plus PRH is HER2 plus?

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:11.980
 I don't know what that means.

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:15.820
 They test for the receptors.

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:16.820
 The ER plus.

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:28.580
 Yeah, estrogen receptor positive, but the receptors just mean that the cell is able

00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:36.140
 to produce and respond to hormones, and when it lacks those receptors, it's usually the

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:45.300
 most dangerous type of cancer, but the presence of those receptors is almost always misinterpreted

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.220
 by doctors.

00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:57.540
 The presence of estrogen, instead of depending on the ovaries as the source, once you get

00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:06.220
 an irritation, the breast itself begins producing estrogen internally, and what you need to

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:15.220
 do is first find a way to reduce that by reducing the polyunsaturated fats and prostaglandins

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:21.220
 inhibiting it with things such as aspirin.

00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:34.820
 The function of progesterone is on all of the cells where they have a progesterone receptor,

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:44.900
 progesterone inhibits cell division and knocks out the estrogen receptor and can inhibit

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:48.980
 the aromatase that produces estrogen.

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:55.900
 So where they tell you to avoid progesterone because it has the receptors for it, the receptor

00:57:55.900 --> 00:58:07.100
 means it's able to be inhibited by progesterone, but bioidentical estrogen is just as harmful

00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:09.780
 as a synthetic estrogen.

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:17.540
 They're all doing the same thing, activating the cell, shifting the metabolism away from

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:28.620
 glucose towards fat and towards the inflammatory intrinsic production of estrogen, so it becomes

00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:29.620
 self-amplifying.

00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:35.180
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:37.060
 Good morning.

00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:38.060
 Great stuff.

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:43.700
 What would Dr. Peat recommend for rheumatoid arthritis in both knees and wrists?

00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:49.500
 I do not eat junk food, lots of vegetables, some fruits, bone broths, organic, everything

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:50.500
 organic, grass-fed.

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.940
 I do some milk.

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:58.380
 I do like cottage cheese, Nancy's brand organic, and butter, but just have these kind of things

00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:02.380
 going on in the knees.

00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:06.940
 With cottage cheese, you want to make sure it doesn't have added lactic acid because

00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:11.860
 bacterial lactic acid is pro-inflammatory.

00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:16.980
 Cottage cheese is very good if it doesn't contain added things.

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:24.500
 It'll say lactic acid right on the label if you don't want that.

00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:33.980
 In general, you want the anti-inflammatory foods, but when you say bone broth, the collagen,

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:46.620
 which is the main benefit of good bone broth, it is around the knobby end bones, the joints,

00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.460
 more than the long bones.

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:54.900
 The long bone contains marrow, which is very rich in iron, and you don't want an excess

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:59.700
 of iron when you have arthritis.

00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:10.740
 I ran across a woman who was convinced that her doctor knew what he was doing in prescribing

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:17.180
 estrogen for her rheumatoid arthritis, but when I talked to her, she couldn't get off

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.500
 the couch.

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:26.620
 Her husband helped her from the bed to the couch, but I talked to her two or three times

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:37.260
 for an hour explaining what estrogen does to the inflammatory systems, and she was convinced

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:43.100
 that her doctor knew that estrogen should be helping.

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:52.340
 But when she finally tried giving up her estrogen pills, immediately she recovered from her

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.620
 rheumatoid arthritis.

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:59.500
 A woman was visiting Eugene from Sweden.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:06.060
 She had had, I think it was three joint replacements and was going to have all of her other main

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:12.820
 joints replaced with ball and socket mechanisms.

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:17.780
 She gave her some progesterone.

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:28.700
 She oiled herself all over with progesterone, and she immediately had no more symptoms of

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:29.940
 rheumatoid arthritis.

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:39.660
 She spent her time in Eugene walking around, enjoying the parks, and said she was going

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:46.340
 to not have any more joints replaced.

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:54.500
 When you get the estrogen down and the progesterone up, whether you do it with diet or supplements,

01:01:54.500 --> 01:02:01.940
 one of the reasons aspirin is helpful for rheumatoid arthritis is that it turns your

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:07.260
 estrogen production down and progesterone up.

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:18.500
 An Italian researcher named Cutolo has shown that estrogen is being produced in the arthritic

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:23.620
 joint, and that the problem is to reduce the estrogen, not to increase it.

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:28.980
 Then if you're doing bone broth for it, you said, "Get some of these, I think you can

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:34.180
 find pig joints and these knuckles and things like that, not necessarily the long bones

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:37.860
 where you get marrow and then too much iron, and that's bad for..."

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:41.860
 Yeah, the joint is full of tendons and ligaments.

01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:45.460
 Yeah, that's what you want, all the gooey stuff in there.

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:51.100
 Dr. Ray P. Patrick Timpone, Dr. David Jebb will be here tomorrow, and we'll stick around

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:55.980
 for a few more minutes here and wrap up all these emails.

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:57.780
 Patrick at OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:02.940
 Previously, Peter from Rhode Island called and talked a bit about his experience with

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.940
 Living Streams probes.

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:09.860
 In general, what I've noticed is digestion so much better.

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:15.380
 I've actually lost weight in places where it's like around the middle a little bit where

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:21.660
 I've been trying for years to lose weight, and I don't know why.

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.740
 I could make up some good reasons.

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.860
 Maybe I'm digesting my food better.

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:30.980
 Maybe some of these probes are digesting the stuff that's there.

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:35.100
 I don't, you know, it's like, who knows, but it's working.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:36.100
 Good for you.

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:37.100
 Good for you.

01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.260
 Yeah, I think you're onto something.

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:39.900
 I mean, who knows?

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:44.060
 Maybe the buggies are eating some stuff that should not be there, and that's why you're

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.660
 losing some weight.

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.340
 Maybe you're digesting your food better.

01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.340
 Maybe all of the above.

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:51.900
 Maybe you're getting more minerals, which makes everything work better.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.540
 It could be all of the above, you know, and multiple choice quiz.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:56.860
 Thanks for calling, Peter.

01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:02.020
 This builds on the argument that when we get the gut biome more in balance, good things

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:04.380
 happen on all different levels.

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:09.020
 So yeah, a lot of good things can happen with these probiotics in there.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:11.700
 And of course, the immune system is right there in the gut.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.260
 There's a great variety of them.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:18.980
 You can call Maryland for more information on what each one of them are kind of pointed

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:23.700
 towards, 360-912-2981.

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:27.980
 That number is 360-912-2981.

01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:31.660
 Call me or email me, and I know a lot about the products.

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:36.500
 Living Streams Probiotics in our store, oneradionetwork.com.

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:42.300
 Years ago, I recall David Wolf suggesting that all foods, superfoods, actually just

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.380
 gives our body information.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.900
 And this came out the last time we talked with Daniel Vitalis about colostrum.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:52.580
 I imagine people being born with an unformatted immune system, and colostrum helps to format

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:53.580
 that.

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:58.780
 It helps to recognize viral and bacterial invaders early, and it also helps to restore

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:03.460
 and heal the lining of the gut that's damaged in so many people, and one of the sources

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:06.340
 of inflammation and low immunity.

01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:10.060
 So it restores that gut lining at the same time that it educates the immune system on

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:13.900
 how to better fight off pathogens that get into our bodies.

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:17.660
 - And it's pretty cool too, I think, because moms can put it in the smoothies quite easily

01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:19.260
 for the kids.

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:21.460
 And it's yummy, and they get some good stuff.

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:24.460
 - Yeah, it's really great to blend into smoothies.

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:25.840
 You can make chocolates with it.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.580
 You can put it into anything that you're cooking, and so it's easy to get into your kids and

01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:31.140
 into other family members.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:35.020
 It tastes great, and it's actually very versatile in the kitchen, so you can use it in place

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.220
 of a lot of other products.

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:40.180
 - Yes, and it's very tasty and fun and easy to use.

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:44.340
 Sometimes just late at night, you can take warm water with colostrum in there before

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:48.500
 bed, and hmm, it's a great product, a lot of benefits.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:51.740
 - Click on any Surthrival link, colostrum1radionetwork.com.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:58.020
 - Yeah, it's good, and you can get two kilo, one kilo, whatever you want there.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:02.940
 And also, that's the place you get pine pollen and elk velvet antler, and the shaga and the

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.020
 reishi, all in my ring glass.

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.340
 Excellent website, Surthrival.

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:11.900
 Through our website, if you would, click away and see if they might have some products there

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.340
 that you'd like to play around with.

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:23.460
 - No, the source on One Radio Network.

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:27.980
 - You can learn more about Dr. Ray Peat through his website, it's rayPeat.com, and sign up

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:29.860
 for his newsletter.

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:33.860
 Lots and lots of stuff on his website, some cool articles, and he really kind of digs

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.780
 deep down in there.

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.260
 Patrick Timpone, April 29th.

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:42.900
 We appreciate Dr. Peat coming on from time to time, thank you.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:53.420
 Dr. Peat, it's so cool that you connect volatile organic compounds to nanoparticles.

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:56.540
 Can you please explain more about this?

01:06:56.540 --> 01:07:01.540
 I didn't know you did that, and when did you do that?

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:09.820
 - My most recent newsletter was about particles, especially nanoparticles, but larger particles

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.780
 are harmful too.

01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:15.220
 They do different things in different ways.

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:25.380
 The nanoparticles happen to be more efficient at activating inflammation, but the larger

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:34.740
 particles, as much as 10 times the diameter of a red blood cell, can pass through the

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:41.620
 wall of the intestine into the blood vessels, and those particles can obstruct arterioles

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:46.100
 and kill a whole region of cells.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:52.420
 So the plastic particles are getting into our food supply, all different sizes, from

01:07:52.420 --> 01:08:03.140
 a hundredth as big as a bacterium to 10 times as big as a red blood cell, a great range

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:09.540
 of particle sizes all have their different toxic effects, and the larger particles in

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:20.220
 particular can be coated with these volatile organic, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.660
 which are carcinogenic in themselves.

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:27.900
 They tend to stick to the surface of some of these particles and get carried into the

01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:32.340
 bloodstream by passing through the wall of the intestine.

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:40.620
 The process is called persortrum, and it's been observed for about almost 200 years,

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:45.940
 and over 100 years ago, the second major study was done.

01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:56.380
 Then starting in the '60s, a German researcher has published many, many studies on it, and

01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:58.700
 it's a very common process.

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:07.180
 It happens whenever you eat undercooked starch, for example, starch particles pass through

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:19.100
 into the bloodstream unless they're in the presence of enough food to energize the intestine

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:23.820
 cells to keep them from being leaky.

01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:31.500
 The leaky intestine isn't just a matter of having holes between cells, but the individual

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:39.420
 cell is weak because it doesn't have enough energy to maintain its internal structure.

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:55.100
 It becomes slightly more tolerant of particles and fluids passing through unchanged.

01:09:55.100 --> 01:10:01.100
 A particle will just press its way into the substance of a cell and pop out the other

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:05.820
 side into a blood vessel.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:18.100
 That has been overlooked intentionally because a doctrine taught to all biologists, practically,

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:30.420
 that a cell has a barrier membrane and that it has to deliberately ingest a particle.

01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:40.820
 The only barrier is that the cell is energized to maintain a water repellent effect.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:49.260
 When it loses energy, it becomes more tolerant to watery substances and particles.

01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:52.740
 They can pass right into the substance of the cell.

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:55.020
 Wow, that's pretty geeky.

01:10:55.020 --> 01:11:03.540
 So what's the takeaway for our listeners as far as avoiding nanoparticles?

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:07.340
 What's the takeaway from what you said?

01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:15.540
 Clothes are being treated with particles that have a deodorant action, silver particles,

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:16.540
 for example.

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:24.860
 When these contact your sweaty skin, the silver particles can actually pass through your skin

01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:27.420
 into your bloodstream.

01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:39.340
 Toothpaste is often massively containing nanoparticles or larger particles just because they assure

01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:43.300
 you that they aren't intended to be nanoparticles.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:50.260
 Still the microparticles, once they're in contact with your mouth membranes or if they're

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:55.100
 swallowed, they can pass into your bloodstream.

01:11:55.100 --> 01:12:03.140
 Salad dressings are often thickened with nanoparticles or close to nanoparticles.

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:13.180
 Fumed silica is particles of glass basically so fine that they will float in the air.

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:20.900
 These are used as a thickening substance in foods and you notice lots of supplements contain

01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:28.540
 silica and titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide.

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:41.980
 These are often designed to be larger particles but even the apparently not nano, only microparticles,

01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:48.740
 these still can contain the nanoparticles that are most pro-inflammatory resembling

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:53.420
 asbestos for their effects on cells.

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:59.340
 So obviously the more natural state we can eat our foods, the better we're going to stay

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:00.740
 away from these guys.

01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:05.020
 Yeah, processed foods are increasingly being contaminated.

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:06.020
 You never know either, right?

01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:09.500
 I mean, they have an ingredient.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:17.060
 For example, there are things called food-grade lubricants to use on your machinery containing

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:24.340
 Teflon microparticles as a lubricant but they're food-grade because they know they're going

01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:29.940
 to contaminate the food but they don't show up on the label because they're just a processing

01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:32.820
 aid.

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:41.020
 So when a food is processed, if it comes in contact with machinery, it might be contaminated

01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:43.260
 with food-grade Teflon lubricant.

01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:44.260
 Yeah, wow.

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:47.580
 Dr. Ray Peat, another little plug then for our sulfur.

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:51.400
 A lot of the sulfur out there, almost all of it has silicon dioxide because they put

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:55.420
 it into capsules and they use it to make the machine work.

01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:57.980
 Another reason why you just want to get the pure stuff like we sell.

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:04.180
 If you want sulfur, don't mess around with all these different excipients.

01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:05.180
 They call them excipients.

01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:08.940
 Let's go to a phone for Dr. Ray Peat.

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:09.940
 Good morning.

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:10.940
 Who's this?

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:12.940
 On the telephone?

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:13.940
 Hello?

01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:15.620
 Well, we lost them.

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:18.740
 We'll go right back to the email here.

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:19.740
 Okay.

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:30.860
 Would Dr. Ray Peat recommend having the mercury amalgams removed in people with neurodegenerative

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:31.860
 issues?

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:33.860
 Oh, he's got some mercury.

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:38.500
 You want to get those out if somebody's got some neuro things going on?

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:47.340
 No, if they're old, they probably have released almost all of the mobile mercury and an old

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:51.420
 filling, I think it's better to not mess with it.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:54.620
 You're going to damage the tooth more taking it out.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:58.660
 Yeah, a lot of dentists recommend with you there.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:04.660
 If it's really old, you can mess things up more than...

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:12.060
 Animal experiments, in rats, they would pull a molar and test it, its mental abilities.

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:19.340
 They found that its memory was impaired with each molar extraction.

01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:27.540
 That is just because the mouth nerves are closely related to the brain function.

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:37.060
 So the more toxic or traumatic experience your jawbone has, the more it's going to affect

01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:39.060
 your nerve stability.

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:40.060
 Interesting.

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:41.660
 Let's try the phone again.

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:42.660
 This morning on the phone, who's this?

01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:43.660
 Yes, this is Brenda.

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:48.660
 Hi, Brenda, you're on the air with Dr. Ray Peat.

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:49.660
 Okay.

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:57.820
 I just heard a little bit earlier him talking about estrogen and all, and I just had a question.

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:04.980
 I've been doing the bioidentical estrogen testosterone pellets for over four years.

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:18.180
 And I mean, I'm like 65, so I'm post-menopausal, and then I take progesterone supplements also,

01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:22.420
 but I feel really great.

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:29.060
 But I was thinking, but he's saying, you know, taking estrogen of any kind, although I had

01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:31.540
 never done just the synthetic.

01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:38.460
 That's why I wanted to do these pellets since they say they're supposed to be like 98% natural

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:42.140
 as much as our body produces.

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:45.780
 So I just wondered.

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:55.540
 Testosterone makes everyone feel good, male or female, but the women get the same effect

01:16:55.540 --> 01:17:05.940
 pretty much from DHEA, which is the precursor of testosterone, and pregnenolone and DHEA

01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:17.700
 both will optimize your progesterone and testosterone without as much risk of excess estrogen.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:28.300
 After the age of about 35, the fat tissues in particular, the more fat there is in the

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:35.780
 body, the more likely it is to produce estrogen, and that becomes a continuous rather than

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:40.060
 a cyclic production of the estrogen.

01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:48.220
 Normally in a cycling woman, you have about two or three days of strong effective estrogen,

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:52.020
 then it's knocked out by progesterone.

01:17:52.020 --> 01:18:00.500
 The cyclic effect is if it's knocked out thoroughly by cyclic progesterone two or three weeks

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:06.220
 of every month, then the estrogen is not carcinogenic.

01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:15.180
 But if it's not interrupted, it becomes even a small amount of uninterrupted estrogen as

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:19.980
 a higher degree of cancer producing.

01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:31.340
 And progesterone, it's normally produced cyclically and the liver throws off the excess when it's

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:35.940
 been present for more than two weeks.

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:41.300
 And so you start losing the effectiveness of progesterone if you don't interrupt it

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:46.860
 and let the liver reset itself so it doesn't throw the progesterone off.

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:52.420
 Did that help you, Brenda, or are you confused?

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:54.860
 Yeah, well, a little.

01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:55.860
 I'm still confused.

01:18:55.860 --> 01:19:04.900
 It's like, oh, trying to figure out what would be the better thing to do.

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:07.060
 But you're feeling good now, though?

01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:09.060
 Feeling good now?

01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:10.060
 Uh-huh.

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:11.060
 Okay.

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:12.060
 Well.

01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:13.060
 Yeah.

01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:18.380
 But I've just wondered, like, for how many years it's supposed to be good to keep doing

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:19.380
 it.

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:20.380
 Yeah, sure.

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:21.380
 I have wondered about that.

01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:22.380
 Yeah.

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:31.300
 There's really no need to supplement estrogen because all of the tissues as they age start

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:34.500
 to produce estrogen.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:44.580
 The skin, uterus, breast, even the liver cells can start producing estrogen rather than excreting

01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:46.940
 it.

01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:54.060
 Testosterone has protective effects like progesterone.

01:19:54.060 --> 01:20:01.900
 I think the reason women live on average longer than men is because they have more progesterone

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:10.900
 where a man's progesterone production is very low in relation to testosterone.

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:16.780
 And progesterone can't be converted to estrogen where testosterone can.

01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:25.980
 So progesterone is more protective in aging than testosterone is.

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:28.980
 Well, I hope this helps with you, Brenda.

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:29.980
 Okay.

01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:30.980
 All right.

01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:31.980
 Thank you so much.

01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:32.980
 Bye.

01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:33.980
 Bye.

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:39.700
 Jeanette says, "I've enjoyed your show with Dr. Peat. Thank you for having him on.

01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:42.260
 I hope he keeps coming back regularly.

01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:47.140
 I started eating chicken necks, carrot salad, oranges to help my thyroid with great results.

01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:49.620
 I feel warmer, have more energy."

01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:51.380
 And would you please ask him this?

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:52.380
 Okay.

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.380
 So far, so good.

01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:58.460
 "How does canned milk compare to fresh milk in terms of nutritional value?"

01:20:58.460 --> 01:20:59.460
 Canned milk.

01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:01.740
 I don't know what they mean, canned milk.

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:02.740
 You mean like...

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:03.740
 Oh, concentrated.

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:04.740
 Concentrated.

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:05.740
 Yeah.

01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:09.300
 It used to be very popular for...

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.300
 Sure.

01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:11.780
 Maybe for...

01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:12.780
 Yeah.

01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.580
 And coffee additive.

01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:24.180
 But there was a discovery in the 1970s that they were soldering the cans with lead and

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:29.500
 milk contained much too high a lead concentration.

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:34.460
 But I think they've revised the manufacture of cans.

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:42.780
 I haven't checked recently, but I think canned milk is now prepared in a way that doesn't

01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:45.980
 contain high amounts of lead.

01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:56.180
 And all you lose is a little bit of the vitamin quality and you have a little bit of oxidized

01:21:56.180 --> 01:22:00.580
 fatty material from the heat process.

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:10.820
 It is not as good as fresh milk, but you have a gradient from fresh raw milk to pasteurized

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:15.220
 milk to ultra-pasteurized to canned milk.

01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:18.700
 And each time it loses a little value.

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:23.700
 But I use pasteurized milk almost always.

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.940
 You don't have a problem with pasteurized.

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:32.940
 She wants to know, "Is goat milk, kefir, and goat cheese good sources for calcium and protein?"

01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:33.940
 Very good.

01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:34.940
 Good.

01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:35.940
 All right.

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:39.860
 Let's move on to another one.

01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:43.380
 Patrick Timpani, oneradionetwork.com.

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:53.500
 I believe Ray Peate mentioned on a past show, taking supplemental iodine does not do anything

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:56.420
 for the thyroid in his last show with you.

01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:01.380
 I've taken some iodine and it virtually gives me wonderful energy, which I'm loving because

01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:03.740
 I often have no energy.

01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:07.180
 So I'm kind of confused on what could be going on.

01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:13.180
 I wonder if it's safe to take iodine every day.

01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:22.140
 Iodine can interact with the polyunsaturated fats in your body, producing an antithyroid

01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.140
 substance.

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:34.500
 And I've got a file of about 70 articles showing that the increased iodine in the diet as a

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:43.980
 result of iodized salt, it has produced a thyroid disease increase and that's correlated

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:52.260
 with increased thyroid cancer as well as various degrees of thyroiditis and nodules of the

01:23:52.260 --> 01:24:01.380
 thyroid, probably because of its interaction with the polyunsaturated fats in the diet.

01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:10.620
 And in some people, at least, iodine in excess has an anti-inflammatory value.

01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:19.540
 So it has been used therapeutically to reduce inflammation and can, for example, help polycystic

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:20.780
 breasts.

01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:30.340
 But when it's taken chronically in large amounts, its tendency is to have an antithyroid effect.

01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:34.060
 So if you took too much, you could actually cause a Hashimoto's?

01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:35.060
 Yeah.

01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:42.880
 This person says, "I also read somewhere that iodine helps to control estrogen.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:45.260
 Does Mr. Peate agree with this?"

01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:49.100
 That's the anti-inflammatory effect.

01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:57.540
 You can demonstrate that a very high amount of iodine reduces inflammation and counteracts

01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:00.700
 that inflammatory effect of estrogen.

01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:08.220
 But some people have the reverse effect, they get an inflammatory reaction to even small

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:09.220
 amounts of iodine.

01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.540
 So you have to be very careful if you're experimenting with it.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:15.180
 Dr. Ray Peate, Patrick D'Emponi, we'll do a few more.

01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:19.260
 I don't know if you can do this one, but you tell me, Dr. Peate.

01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:26.500
 I never really heard a clear explanation of how the male hormone system works.

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:33.500
 Would it be possible for Dr. Peate to give us this on a show?

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:42.660
 Well, it's infinitely complicated, but it's a lot simpler than female hormones because

01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:45.940
 there isn't that powerful cyclic effect.

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:50.900
 A woman goes through two distinct phases.

01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:58.380
 The estrogen is knocked out by the progesterone, where a man constantly has to deal with those

01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:03.660
 same effects.

01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:14.540
 If you think of it in terms of a long-range stress effect, testosterone for most of your

01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:24.420
 lifespan is having an anti-stress effect, but if your thyroid is interfered with in

01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:35.220
 any way, radiation or too much of certain amino acids or not enough nutrients, a slow

01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:43.060
 thyroid will shift you over to the conversion of testosterone to estrogen.

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:49.100
 That's where the degenerative problems start.

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:54.980
 Testosterone should protect your nervous system just like progesterone and protects against

01:26:54.980 --> 01:27:05.140
 cancer, but when your energy is reduced by a falling thyroid function, then it becomes

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:07.780
 analogous to the female's problem.

01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:09.740
 I see.

01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:16.620
 Do you ever recommend to folks to take the actual supplemental testosterone, the pellets

01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:19.620
 and that kind of stuff?

01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:26.020
 Well, a pellet is probably better than an oily injection.

01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:32.540
 I would recommend it if it was available as pure testosterone, but it's typically sold

01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:40.140
 as testosterone esters, a completely chemically different substance that's dissolved in vegetable

01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:50.420
 oil, often with a solvent, a benzoyl alcohol, which is in itself toxic, neurotoxic, but

01:27:50.420 --> 01:28:01.820
 the vegetable oil has its toxic effect in the muscle if it's injected IM, so it's a

01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:06.700
 matter of how it is available.

01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:17.700
 So I don't often recommend it because usually an injection will contain 50 or 100 milligrams

01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:26.820
 of this testosterone ester and a young man might produce four or five milligrams a day

01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:38.540
 of the actual testosterone, so you get these huge excesses as well as the toxic breakdown

01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:48.220
 products of the solvent that are real drawbacks to the use of pharmaceutical supplements.

01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:54.820
 So if you can get a real pure testosterone, it might be okay to use?

01:28:54.820 --> 01:29:01.180
 Yeah, and it produces great physical, mental effects.

01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:13.460
 DHEA as a precursor to testosterone is very easily available, and again, you don't want

01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:16.620
 to take unphysiologically huge amounts.

01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:23.300
 I've known men who developed an enlarged liver with estrogen as high as a young woman's when

01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:28.660
 they were taking 25 milligrams a day of DHEA.

01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:36.420
 A full replacement dose is around 15 milligrams, which an 80 or 90-year-old man might need.

01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:38.460
 I see, 15 milligrams.

01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:42.660
 Anything with the DHEA for the T or just by itself?

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:43.660
 Just by itself is fine.

01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:47.980
 Just a little bit, though, just a little bit.

01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:58.060
 Many plant toxins, writes an email, or antibiotics, for example, chlorellin, C-H-L-O-R-E-L-L-I-N,

01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:01.900
 and allopathy is the science devoted to it.

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:09.780
 Can you recommend any effective natural antibiotics to folks who don't want to go to medical doctors?

01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:20.780
 Yeah, the two that I think are safest for actually killing organisms are flowers of

01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:25.580
 sulfur for use on the skin and intestine.

01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:34.460
 Two hundred milligrams orally in two or three days, it can kill off the most toxic of the

01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:37.140
 intestinal bacteria and fungus.

01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:38.140
 No kidding.

01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:44.500
 On the skin, it has been used not only for fungus infections of the skin, just dusting

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:53.140
 on flowers of sulfur or using 10% sulfur soap to wash with, leaves a residue of sulfur on

01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:57.820
 the skin, but it can be used for scabies even.

01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:07.500
 A salve made of mixing butter with flowers of sulfur was tested and found just as effective

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:15.420
 as the brain toxic insecticides or scabicides that are used medically.

01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:20.620
 But this flowers of sulfur, you do take it internally, two hundred milligrams?

01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:21.620
 Yeah.

01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:26.540
 And it works on intestinal bacteria, the bad guys?

01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:31.980
 Yeah, the fungus has been the best studied.

01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:44.740
 Candida, for example, secretes enzymes that convert the yellow crystalline sulfur, convert

01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:51.020
 it to sulfuric acid and poison themselves or hydrogen sulfide.

01:31:51.020 --> 01:32:01.380
 So they locally create a toxic condition that kills them, but it is very, very harmless

01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:05.780
 to the intestine if you take a very small amount like 200 milligrams.

01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:06.860
 Flowers of sulfur.

01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:10.260
 So that's very different from the sulfur we promote, the pure sulfur, right?

01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:15.940
 This is a whole other product that's created from sulfur called flowers of sulfur?

01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:26.380
 It's the very fine particles of sulfur, but they're quickly dissolved and metabolized

01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:29.260
 by the organisms.

01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:32.860
 So I've never heard of a problem with...

01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:33.860
 I'll be darned.

01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:40.940
 I've never even heard of that idea of flowers of sulfur, but that's a good antibiotic.

01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:50.140
 And aspirin, when it's used with the standard antibiotics, it can greatly increase their

01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:51.900
 effectiveness.

01:32:51.900 --> 01:33:00.580
 But all by itself, it has antibiotic antiviral as well as antibacterial and antifungal effects.

01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:04.900
 It's too cheap to be of interest pharmaceutically.

01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:14.780
 There was a study treating AIDS patients with just aspirin, large doses, and the results

01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:18.140
 seemed very favorable, but no one promoted it.

01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:20.940
 Okay, it was too cheap, right?

01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:26.260
 What about some folks who take aspirin preventive-wise or just in general?

01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:28.340
 I mean, is it okay?

01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:34.260
 Yeah, it's something I do just from the known protective effects of it.

01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:35.260
 I'll be darned.

01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:36.820
 Just a little bare aspirin?

01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:41.180
 Yeah, anywhere from 100 to 300 milligrams.

01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:42.180
 I think one of the regular...

01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:45.020
 Aren't the regular pills about 300, something like that?

01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:47.020
 It's hard to even find a pure bare aspirin.

01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:49.340
 They want to do all kinds of weird things to it.

01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:52.260
 Oh, yeah.

01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:55.940
 You can buy a pound of aspirin for about $10 or $15.

01:33:55.940 --> 01:34:01.100
 Oh, you mean just pure aspirin, like chemical stores, something like that?

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:03.580
 It should be USP grade.

01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:05.940
 USP aspirin.

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:08.820
 Is Dr. Peat familiar with NR?

01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:11.380
 Have you heard of that?

01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:14.780
 For improving our lifespan?

01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:19.780
 Yeah, NR.

01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:21.500
 Just the letters NR.

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:22.500
 Correct.

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:29.860
 The only product I know is Nature's Remedy.

01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:35.660
 I'm not sure what they have in mind.

01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:36.660
 That's okay.

01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:41.380
 What does Dr. Peat recommend eating for balancing progesterone?

01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:44.820
 Is it only an orange if progesterone supplementation is required?

01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:50.500
 Do you recommend a drop of the cream nowadays?

01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:53.660
 How does one know when supplementation is required?

01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:58.860
 My wife said that she feels like a million bucks when she was pregnant and her progesterone

01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:05.340
 levels were somewhat normal.

01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:11.780
 The pregnancy effect is anti-aging.

01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:18.900
 There were studies in rabbits that showed that each pregnancy, the estrogen aged the

01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:28.860
 connective tissues, but the pregnancy left the rabbit younger than it had been during

01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:30.420
 and before the pregnancy.

01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:39.540
 So they looked at longevity figures for I think it was in the hundreds of thousands

01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:46.380
 of women in Hungary and they saw a very neat relationship.

01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:53.140
 Lifespan increased in proportion to the number of babies they had had up to eight babies

01:35:53.140 --> 01:36:03.540
 per woman, they had the longest life expectancy, showing apparently the same pregnancy effect,

01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:11.260
 leaving a residually higher progesterone level in the body, reversing the pro-aging effects

01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:12.260
 of estrogen.

01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:13.260
 Very interesting.

01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:14.260
 Here's an email.

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:20.540
 "I went through menopause 13 years ago and I'm no estrogen or progesterone from any

01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:22.100
 urine test I've done.

01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:27.340
 My doctor wants to put me on a compound hormone replacement therapy, but people have said

01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:28.700
 no don't do it.

01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:36.660
 My question is, would just taking progesterone help me with dryness, painful intercourse,

01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:41.420
 and the feeling of learned helplessness?"

01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:47.220
 Typically it does.

01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:56.140
 If you create learned helplessness in animals, their estrogen goes up and progesterone goes

01:36:56.140 --> 01:37:03.580
 down and you can reverse it with either progesterone or active thyroid hormone.

01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:12.740
 And when you give animals an entertaining, free environment, lots of things to do, their

01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:17.820
 progesterone goes up and their estrogen goes down.

01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:26.900
 And with aging, the serum estrogen goes down along with the serum progesterone, but that

01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:34.740
 doesn't reflect the actual biological situation because estrogen is formed in any kind of

01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:43.420
 cell that's under stress, but it is bound by the so-called estrogen receptor or estrogen

01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:46.740
 binding proteins inside cells.

01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:54.180
 It's produced there and retained inside cells and can't get into the bloodstream in the

01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:57.100
 absence of progesterone.

01:37:57.100 --> 01:38:02.620
 Progesterone's function is to knock out not only the aromatase that makes estrogen, but

01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:07.900
 to knock out the estrogen receptor that binds it and keeps it in cells.

01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:18.020
 So when you give someone postmenopausal who has very low blood or serum estrogen, you

01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:24.500
 give them progesterone, suddenly the cells expel their estrogen.

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:33.460
 The liver detoxifies it, makes it water-soluble to leave in the kidneys.

01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:43.700
 So the woman who is most under the influence of estrogen because of having no progesterone

01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:49.740
 will show almost zero estrogen in the serum because it's all inside cells.

01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:51.780
 I see.

01:38:51.780 --> 01:39:03.580
 The fellow wrote back, "The NR was nicodiamide riboside precursor to NAD, supposed to be

01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:08.300
 key to longevity and regeneration."

01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:17.220
 Those already reduced substances, I'm skeptical that they're even making it into the cells

01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:22.940
 without being oxidized en route unless you inject them intravenously.

01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:28.100
 Even then, the blood contains things that can oxidize them.

01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:35.340
 But just taking niacinamide will increase your intracellular NAD.

01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:38.380
 That's very simple to do and economical and harmless.

01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:44.220
 And it's harmless and that could increase strength and longevity.

01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:52.740
 Yeah, the NAD is very important and is increased by supplementing niacinamide.

01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:53.740
 Finally here, then we'll let you go.

01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:56.740
 And I wanted to just get your opinion from me.

01:39:56.740 --> 01:40:02.060
 What's your make of this, your take on this whole big gluten thing that we've experienced

01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:04.220
 in what, the last 15 years?

01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:08.020
 And of course now they have gluten-free aisles at the store.

01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:14.700
 Give me your perspective on what went on here and what is going on with gluten sensitivity

01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:17.860
 here with all your research.

01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:23.820
 There's an article on my website about gluten.

01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:31.900
 It happens to interact with stress and estrogen.

01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:40.820
 The gluten molecule oddly has a stretch of amino acids that resembles proteins that are

01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:45.580
 involved with stress, inflammation and estrogen.

01:40:45.580 --> 01:41:01.700
 And so if you're stressed and tending to have high estrogen, you're creating a molecular

01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:09.060
 antigen surface that responds to gluten in your diet.

01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:17.340
 But if you're in very good condition, have your estrogen under control, the gluten is

01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:23.820
 digested properly without presenting that antigenic toxic effect.

01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:28.100
 So a lot of this gluten stuff is tied in with stress?

01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:29.100
 Yeah.

01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:30.100
 Wow.

01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:33.380
 Just like everything, huh?

01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:41.820
 Yeah, it's a hormonal, immunological process that gluten just happens to be a molecule

01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:50.820
 that has this stretch of amino acids that gives us a signal that amplifies our own stress

01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:53.740
 inflammatory reactions.

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:59.140
 Looking back, do you have a good sense of how this whole gluten sensitivity, gluten-free

01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:00.780
 thing started?

01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:12.060
 Yeah, I think a bad diet that creates inflammation by not enough protein, having unsaturated

01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:23.540
 rather than saturated fats and generally poor nutrition and having improperly leavened bread,

01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:30.500
 blowing up the bread quickly rather than soaking it for 12 hours in the old-fashioned leavening

01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:41.460
 machine, the soaking to let it leaven naturally with yeast, in those 12 hours at approximately

01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:54.700
 room temperature, the gluten was digested by the enzymes in the wheat germ and the pre-digestion

01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:59.780
 kept us from being exposed to gluten.

01:42:59.780 --> 01:43:07.180
 So when they make the bread economically and quickly, the gluten stays there and gives

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:14.780
 the bread a rubbery, elastic texture that is pleasant to eat because it tends to be

01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:16.780
 moist and soft.

01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:26.060
 But that gluten which makes the bread economical and pleasant to eat happens to be endogenic

01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:27.620
 and allergenic.

01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:35.380
 So there's a lot going on in the gluten world with doctors and stuff and healing that's

01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:37.100
 maybe just not right.

01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:48.420
 Yeah, many years ago I was interested in baking bread and made very tasty bread with a 12-hour

01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:50.780
 leavening process.

01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:59.100
 I had previously noticed that eating a slice of standard grocery store bread would make

01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:07.660
 me have bad sleep, digestive discomfort that woke me up repeatedly.

01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:13.340
 When I baked my own bread that was leavened, I could eat a whole loaf of it at bedtime

01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:14.340
 and sleep perfectly.

01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:19.380
 Oh, you mean because you were using yeast and you just leavened it and you did...

01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:22.900
 Or was it a sourdough thing, sourdough culture?

01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:26.620
 Yeah, it was soaked for 12 hours.

01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:32.980
 That destroys almost all the gluten, converts it to nutritious protein.

01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:37.740
 So it's not only less pro-inflammatory but more nutritious.

01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:40.460
 It actually has more protein.

01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:43.580
 Ah, the wonders of the body in science and research.

01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:45.020
 You just keep on digging.

01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:48.780
 Well, Dr. Peat, thanks for coming back and being with us.

01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:49.780

01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:24.580
 Bye.

01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:26.260
 Dr. Ray Peat comes on from time to time.

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:30.100
 Been pretty regular and we'll just keep asking him because we love listening to all this

01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:31.100
 cool stuff.

01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:34.720
 Okay, kids, we're going to do Dr. David Jupp tomorrow.

01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:35.720
 Can you believe it?

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:38.020
 Yeah, he's a handful.

01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:39.460
 He's going to be fun.

01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:44.540
 He's written like 10 books since we've last talked to him, which I don't know how long

01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:45.540
 ago it's been.

01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:47.420
 I'll have to look on our website.

01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:48.420
 But he's going to be fun.

01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:50.020
 He'll be here tomorrow.

01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:51.500
