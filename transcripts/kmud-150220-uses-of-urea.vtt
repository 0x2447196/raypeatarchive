00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.040
 Hi and good evening to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray. For

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.880
 those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows which run every third Friday

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.640
 of the month from 7-8pm, I'm a licensed medical herbalist who trained in England and graduated

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.160
 there with a Master's Degree in Herbal Medicine. I run a clinic in Garberville where I consult

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.040
 with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.080
 advice. So, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM. And,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.760
 from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.520
 either related or unrelated to this month's subject, an ongoing subject perhaps, of the

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:23.320
 use of urea in the treatment of various pathologies. We're also going to get into a recapitulation

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.200
 if you like about isoflavones, soy products, etc. Things that are touted as being healthful

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:39.480
 and where the mistakes have come from because I know Dr. Pete has at length discussed various

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.960
 of these subjects and there is no science behind it, but unfortunately they're still

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.800
 portrayed in the mainstream as very healthful along with the fish oil. So, we're going to

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.960
 get into that later on after the topic of urea in the treatment of disease. For those

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.680
 of you who are calling outside the area, the show is live and from 7.30 until 8 o'clock

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.040
 we take callers who'd like to pose questions to Dr. Pete either related to this month's

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.200
 subject or if indeed they have other questions health-related that they'd like to ask Dr.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.280
 Pete, then they're also welcome to do that. So, the number if they live outside the area,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:25.480
 the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD which is 1-800-568-3723. For those in the local

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:33.320
 area, the 707 area code at least, the number is 923-3911. And I can be reached toll-free

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.960
 on 1-888-WBM-ERB for consultations or any other further information Monday through Friday,

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.800
 regular business hours. Okay, so Dr. Pete, are you with us?

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.680
 Yes. Oh, hi. Thanks for joining us.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.640
 So, again as always, perhaps for those people who might have just tuned in for the first

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.200
 time or for people that may have only heard of you once or twice as well as those who

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.880
 are regular listeners to your show, would you just discuss your professional and academic

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.040
 background and how it's brought you to where you're at now?

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:16.000
 I don't really have a professional background, I guess, but academically I studied various

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:27.120
 things for an MA in humanities and then 1968 to '72 I got a PhD in biology specializing

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:36.320
 in reproductive physiology and the biochemistry related to it. But I've been talking to lots

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:46.920
 of people about biological ideas for about 50 years, so my education comes in a lot of

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:53.720
 non-academic ways. Okay, so I know that you're constantly researching

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:02.800
 both old as well as novel breakthroughs in the interpretation of disease and the approach

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.760
 to disease which is less than mainstream medical approaches because the science very often

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:19.320
 has a different perspective to which I think most people are subject in medicine per se.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:26.240
 That is to say, I think sometimes the truth of trials and research that's done isn't always

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.680
 brought out to the public, certainly not in a timely manner. Maybe 20 or 30 years later

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.720
 we begin to see the revelations from that initial research and it comes to the attention

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:44.000
 of people a bit like the U-turn, if you like, on the polyunsaturated oils that now are recognized

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.480
 as being negative for a person's health rather than the financially viable positive health

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:59.760
 benefits. So I think for this month, we talked about it a little while ago, last month or

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:08.080
 in December's show, about the treatment of urea in cancer, specifically with reference

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:15.920
 to a Dr. Evangelos Danopoulos, a Greek medical doctor who actually was, I think he was conferred

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.160
 an honorary professorship. I think they know him now on the internet as Professor Danopoulos.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:28.440
 But ultimately, he published quite a few peer-reviewed papers in respective medical

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:36.160
 journals, those being things like The Lancet and in the journal Clinical Oncology, one

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.960
 particularly I know we're probably going to quote from, or you're probably going to quote

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.160
 from too, that were published in 1983 and he did some research prior to that in the

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:54.680
 late 70s. So some of the questions on urea and how a simple compound like urea that's

00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:01.520
 totally non-toxic, extremely inexpensive and very well tolerated by all the people that

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:07.720
 were using it and people that use it per se around the world for various things from skin

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:14.720
 conditions to these cancers that we'll talk about. What are your interpretations of the

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.920
 mechanism by which urea is affecting this anti-cancer activity? And then we'll get into

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.440
 some of the outright experiments that were done.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:32.240
 I think one of the essential things is that it inhibits nitric oxide formation. And nitric

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:44.700
 oxide formation is probably the main means by which stress of any kind can turn off oxidative

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:55.080
 energy production. And so anything that will turn off nitric oxide excess will restore

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:05.880
 energy production and restoring energy production has all kinds of even structural ramifications.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:15.780
 The constant consumption of oxygen is maintaining and renewing the microscopic structure of

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:27.220
 a cell. The membrane, people about 50 years ago were arguing that the membrane is semi-permeable

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:34.580
 and it has to have pumps and cell energy has to run those pumps. But in fact, there are

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:42.140
 no demonstrated pumps and the pumps that they postulated would take many times more energy

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:49.300
 than the cell could ever produce. So the cell is doing something with its energy very different

00:09:49.300 --> 00:10:00.140
 from maintaining an osmotic balance. It's maintaining the structure in an atomically

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:09.580
 fine sense structure right down to the electronic relations of atoms to each other. And it's

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:18.700
 this kind of balance that urea participates in directly as well as helping to prevent

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:27.860
 the loss of the oxidative production of energy. So the energy produces this structure which

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:37.460
 has all of the properties of life and urea fits into that in a unique way so that the

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:48.780
 normal amount in the blood is just a few milligrams per 100 cc's of blood. But you can increase

00:10:48.780 --> 00:11:00.580
 that to 1000 milligrams per to 100, almost 1% of the blood without disturbing things

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:09.220
 physiologically. And DeNopolis found that when he got the blood level up to at least

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:18.220
 85 milligrams per cent, more than 10 times the normal amount, the cancers would start

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:29.780
 disappearing. And so it's a matter of concentration. Even before that concentration, it will have

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:39.500
 shut down the production and action of nitric oxide. But then it has these structure stabilizing

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:48.660
 effects. It fits right into the way water is structured and it increases the ability

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:56.460
 of the cell's natural hormones to structure the water and protein system the way the cell

00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:04.740
 wants to structure it. So it's like urea is supporting what the cell wants to do, even

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.700
 when it's at these extremely high concentrations.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:16.980
 So it's a little bit similar to the electronic state structuring water when we talk about

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.660
 structured water that you think

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:25.300
 Yeah, it's exactly what the oxidative system is doing to the electrons. It's preventing

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:33.460
 an excess of electrons and toxins and carcinogens and radiation are doing exactly the opposite.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.300
 They're putting too many loose electrons into the wrong places.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:44.380
 Right. So and this and this by your description of too many loose electrons, we can imagine

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:49.940
 those as being what they call the damaging free radicals and things like

00:12:49.940 --> 00:13:00.140
 that. Even more extensive than that, it's the chemical system of the proteins contains

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:08.140
 a lot of sulfhydryl compounds, glutathione that a lot of doctors are using intravenously

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:19.460
 as an anti stress thing. This is a sulfur compound maintained by energy rich fuel molecules,

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:29.860
 and it maintains a certain degree of oxidation in balance with sulfhydryl groups attached

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:38.060
 to the proteins and the proteins are in there like a reservoir of electrons at the right

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:48.260
 energy level and the oxygen metabolism besides providing ATP and other forms of energy is

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:56.940
 preventing an overflow of loose electrons getting into the structure of the proteins.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:06.740
 Too many electrons will de differentiate the cell move towards non oxidative energy production

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.860
 and the formation of lactic acid which can start vicious circles.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:22.500
 Right. Okay, because I know I read a several abstracts of that old. Yeah. Published pieces

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:28.420
 of work done with various groups of people with cancers. I know he worked on liver cancer

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:33.940
 was something I believe I believe we brought out two months ago. The treatment and approach

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:40.140
 to liver cancer with urea. I know he worked a lot with people that had liver primaries

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:47.620
 and or secondaries, but the ocular cancers, the cancers of the eye, the melanomas and

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:55.180
 the basal cell carcinomas. That was pretty interesting the way urea again was used in

00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:01.300
 the treatment of those ocular cancers and his articles on that have photographs that

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:11.060
 show very vividly the correction, the elimination of the cancer and restoration of normal tissue.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:17.580
 And one of the interesting things about urea is that at these very high concentrations,

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:30.060
 it is so stabilizing to normal tissue that it prevents the formation of deforming scars.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:41.460
 In a 1935 publication, someone was describing its use in treating wounds of all kinds, packing

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:54.900
 crystals right into the wound or the ulcer or whatever was an open damage to the organism,

00:15:54.900 --> 00:16:04.060
 putting the solid urea into it and leaving it would clear up the infection and stimulate

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.900
 healing but it would heal without visible scarring.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:15.500
 I read that it promoted a fairly rapid granulation tissue in the wounds and that was part of

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:22.020
 its part of its mechanism by which it achieved such good wound healing.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:31.740
 I was seeing a story about an African spiny mouse that can regenerate its tissue very

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:39.500
 quickly like they mentioned that punching a hole in the skin, it could close the wound

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:47.660
 by almost two-thirds in the first day. In three or four days, the wound would be healed

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.660
 without a scar.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:53.940
 Now this I think from an energy perspective is quite interesting. It's a bit of a sidetrack

00:16:53.940 --> 00:17:01.580
 from the subject but young children and young adults, they heal rapidly compared to older

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:08.340
 people and that's got to be down to an electronic energy state within the organism, correct?

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:17.900
 Yeah, the oxidative metabolism slows down from early in embryonic development down to

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:26.060
 old age. There's a steady decrease of oxidative metabolism.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:36.580
 Yeah, it's the downfall of all of us who are gradually aging. Okay, so in order to, very

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:41.900
 quickly again, in order to stave off that kind of electronic degradation and the inability

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:49.700
 to oxidatively repair, what do you think are some of the best tactics that people can use

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:55.140
 to maintain the ability to stave off that damage?

00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:05.460
 In the uterus, the developing embryo also heals without scarring. I think two factors

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:15.220
 are involved in that. The high carbon dioxide level and the higher urea and related compounds

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:25.980
 in the amniotic fluid. In the adult also, just pure carbon dioxide gas can be blown

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:37.140
 into an ulcer and stimulate healing, control other symptoms, reduce pain and so on. But

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:45.420
 I think as soon as an organism is born, it starts interacting with the outside environment

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:52.860
 where in the uterus it was getting its energy filtered through the placenta and making its

00:18:52.860 --> 00:19:03.620
 own fats out of the glucose and fructose that were provided to it. And the organism using

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:12.500
 carbohydrate for energy produces saturated fats or omega minus nine unsaturated fats.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:21.420
 And when we come into the world, we're exposed to the fats produced by organisms living at

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:32.260
 a lower temperature generally. And the colder a plant is exposed to, the more unsaturated

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:40.700
 its fats are and they're of a different type than we would make ourselves. And those interrupt

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:48.420
 our oxidative metabolism to the extent that we become saturated with them. And that happens

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:54.460
 progressively from the time we're born in the old age generally.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:20:00.860
 Okay. Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. Again, we're very proud to have

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:07.660
 Dr. Pete sharing his expertise with us on the show. From 730 to 8 o'clock, you're invited

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:12.980
 to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of urea

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:18.060
 and the treatment of cancers with urea. And then in a bit here, we're going to get into

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:26.900
 some of the mistaken lies, in fact, maybe even purposeful lies that are portrayed in

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:33.660
 the media from various supplement companies and big industry related to estrogen and bone

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:38.820
 health and cancers and phytoestrogens role in that. So if you live in the area, the number

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:48.020
 is 9233911. Or there's a toll free number if you live outside the area. That's 1-800-568-3723.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:57.100
 So Dr. Pete, just going back to Dr. Danopoulos' work with cancer, he had several, quite a

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:05.380
 few cases actually of cancers that were completely healed. And I just find it so shocking when

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:12.780
 here is scientific evidence peer reviewed in scientific magazines that are portraying

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:19.020
 various other experiments from drug companies and/or individual research from universities

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:25.320
 that showed what happened. And I just find it hard to believe that this kind of thing

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:30.060
 doesn't perpetuate itself and become common knowledge to a point where it's actually taken

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:37.260
 up by academic institutes and made more viable.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:45.180
 The medical journals depend on the pharmaceutical industry largely. And urea that sells for

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:55.300
 a couple dollars a pound or something isn't a very good drug, especially a drug that cures

00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:05.020
 isn't a good drug, even if it's expensive. A cheap drug that cures just won't work in

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.020
 the medical system.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:10.660
 I mean I wanted to bring these out just for those people that are listening. I think we

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:17.340
 all have free choice. And to find information out for ourselves is always a good idea rather

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:23.420
 than just listening to whatever it is that we're being told by whoever it is that's telling

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.580
 us. It's always very good I think, especially in the age of the internet where I know there's

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.320
 lots of bad information on the internet, it's not to say it's all good, but there's lots

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:36.820
 of places where you can go and you can read scientific medical information that you know

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:42.500
 is being researched and you know it's been pretty well scrutinized. And when it's telling

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:47.820
 you that this kind of thing is being used to treat a cancer, it's very hard to ignore

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.820
 it.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.580
 So I think just for those people that are listening perhaps, they might want to look

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:59.760
 at Dr. Danopoulos' work in the late 70s and the early 80s and his approach to the treatment

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:06.860
 of liver disease with urea as well as cancers of the eye. And then I think the other thing

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:13.580
 I wanted to get into was just some of the amounts of the product. And as we've already

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:19.420
 mentioned, urea is extremely non-toxic. It's kind of odourless and tasteless and doesn't

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:25.820
 really have anything negative going for it. It's very well tolerated. So I know some of

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:33.860
 the instances where he's quoting case histories here, we're using something like 15, I don't

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:39.380
 know, one of the quotes was 15 grams of urea in a quart of water. And this was to be drunk

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:44.540
 daily. So this was just a total amount of urea to be consumed every hour or so, you

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:49.780
 know, in the waking hour from, I don't know, from 9 or 10 o'clock through till 6 or 7 in

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:56.780
 the afternoon. So 15 grams of urea and then there were injections that were done with

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:05.820
 a 15, up to 50, between 15 and 50%. I think the average was kind of a 20, 25% urea solution

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:11.820
 for skin tumors and that was found to be highly effective. And then I know he mentions, and

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.420
 this is a little bit different, I think here in the States we use blood urea and nitrogen,

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:25.620
 but he was quoting blood urea as a level and quoting 75 to 85 milligrams per cent. So do

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:32.900
 you know roughly what that would equate to, 75 to 85 milligrams per cent? That would be?

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:42.380
 I think it requires taking quite a bit more than 15 grams per day. Some of the studies

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:52.060
 were using up to 120 grams per day divided up in doses of about 15 grams at a time.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.060
 Interesting.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:25:01.100
 And in the 1950s, it was probably the main treatment used for brain swelling, reducing

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:12.060
 brain edema because a lot of people were thinking of it as an osmotic treatment and it was

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:23.260
 displaced by various osmotic substances with the idea that you would make the blood hyperosmotic

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:31.300
 to draw the excess water out of the brain into the blood. But urea isn't osmotically

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:39.740
 active because it goes right into the cells and to be osmotically active has to be like

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:46.340
 sodium that stays outside the cell or like sucrose or some of the sugars that can't be

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:55.500
 absorbed. But urea goes into the cell, sort of soothes the cell's excitation, changes

00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:04.220
 its electronic balance and lets the cell excrete, give up the water that it doesn't need, very

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:13.300
 much the way progesterone and thyroid work, adjusting the electronic state so that the

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:27.140
 ion exchange system and electronic affinity for water is downgraded so that it doesn't

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:31.580
 bind so much water.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:39.060
 That same anti-edema effect is still here and there used for treating congestive heart

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:49.420
 failure. I was looking up the Mexican pharmacopeia and I see that they still list urea to treat

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:58.780
 the edema of heart failure because it's a diuretic that makes the kidneys work better.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:08.220
 It also causes the muscles and other organs to not retain water so greedily.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:15.620
 Okay, so you said again, just to quote you again, up to 120 grams a day you're saying?

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:21.660
 Yeah, for getting rid of excess water. That was the amount they used.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:28.820
 And then you also mentioned in conjunction with urea therapy a compound called creatine

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:36.380
 hydrate and saying that the two of these compounds together was even more effective at treating

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:41.740
 these cancers than the urea alone. Do you know much about creatine hydrate?

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:50.700
 No, I think it's probably having some of the physical effects similar to urea but it also

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:55.140
 enters into the energy storage and management system.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:59.780
 Right, okay. Alright, so for those of you who are listening, like I said, you can look

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:06.540
 on the internet, type in "Doctor or Professor Evangelos Danopoulos" and you can read all

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:11.660
 about his work with liver cancer, eye cancers and other skin cancers with the treatment

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:17.860
 of urea. So it might well be worth some people who have a compunction to do it to take a

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:18.860
 look.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:23.340
 The other thing that caught my attention here, and I don't know, it sounds kind of incredible

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:28.860
 and I don't mean to sound like I'm laughing but it's just a bit like the cancer thing.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:35.780
 It's just hard to imagine that these things can go by and not make a big dent or a big

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:42.580
 impact because the next statement was the common white and brown mushrooms and we're

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:48.340
 going to get into aromatase and breast cancer in a bit here with the discussion on isoflavones

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:54.820
 and soy and why what they tell you is not the truth actually and this is the fact. But

00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:02.020
 the use of white and brown mushrooms to inhibit aromatase and prevent breast cell proliferation.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:07.380
 They were talking about 10 grams of mushroom a day. Presumably this is cooked now because

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.020
 I know you've mentioned that regular white mushrooms and brown mushrooms actually contain

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:16.040
 a fairly carcinogenic compound but 10 grams of cooked mushrooms a day reduce breast cancer

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:22.460
 by 64% and then with the addition of a daily gram of green tea leaves, which we probably,

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.620
 all those health conscious people have probably heard about the antioxidant benefits of green

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:32.180
 tea, with the addition of a single gram of green tea leaves they got up to 89% reduction

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:36.140
 in breast cancer. I find that incredible.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:43.740
 Yeah, you would think that there would be more news about that.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:49.980
 Okay, anyway, so that's a couple of things that I wanted to bring out. We do have a couple

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:57.380
 of people I think waiting to take questions so the engineer here I think he's going to

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.740
 be passing those people on to us here any minute. Yeah, so I think we have a caller

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.740
 here. You're on the air and where are you from?

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.500
 This is David from Missouri.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.860
 Oh, hey David. What's your question?

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:14.260
 Well, you know, when you were talking about urea, it seems like through the years I've

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:21.820
 read about indigenous people around the world actually using urine products for medicinal

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:28.140
 purposes. Do you think why they intuitively knew that somehow that was the urea within

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.140
 the urine?

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.140
 Yeah, I would.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:34.220
 Because it had healing properties, you know, and because those people are probably in a

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:39.980
 much cleaner environment, it could be possibly safe.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:46.140
 Dr. Peet, do you think there's anything to be said for the supposed sterility here of

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:51.900
 urine given that you don't have a urinary tract infection, but its sterility and the

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.420
 high concentration of urea in urine?

00:30:54.420 --> 00:31:03.820
 Yeah, I've known quite a few people who did it regularly and it seemed extremely healthy.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:11.500
 It's been, the Chinese used it for example, and one of their interpretations was that

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:21.300
 it was the steroids. They concentrated things like the metabolites of progesterone and pregnenolone

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:29.980
 from the urine and used these to extend the lives of the kings and rich people.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:30.980
 Interesting.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:40.820
 Interesting, huh? Well, and Dr. Peet, do you, you know, the main things that you promote,

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:49.260
 you know, eating saturated fat, getting plenty of sunlight and a certain level of CO2, I'm

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:54.780
 not sure exactly how to ask this, but if we were to work backwards on the physiology of

00:31:54.780 --> 00:32:05.420
 the human body, it appears that evolution of humanity occurred in equatorial areas and

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:13.500
 possibly in more high altitude areas. And I guess the warm climate would also be that

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:20.020
 you would probably be eating more saturated fat in plants and maybe in animals? Would

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:26.260
 that be a, if somebody were to, you know, take your philosophy seriously and start doing

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:32.420
 studies based on that idea, do you think they would find that that is how man evolved and

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:38.700
 that moving away from the equator is where a lot of the problems are occurring for the

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:39.700
 human organism?

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:51.500
 Yeah, that's my orientation on the issue of origins. High altitude, warm climate, lots

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:58.980
 of fruit and all foods would be more saturated in a more equatorial environment.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:07.500
 Do you think in general that people that are studying science know that that is the case

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:13.700
 or probably not because they're not warning us about polyunsaturated fats and they're

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:18.860
 not telling us we need more sunlight and they must be oblivious to that, I guess.

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:29.020
 I ran across publications in some of the fairly well-known food journals 40, 50 years ago

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:42.780
 showing that the fats vary with the climate and that the fats have a definite function.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:51.740
 Some of them are functioning to protect the plants against animal predators by poisoning

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:59.460
 them so they put lots of the unsaturated fats in their seeds. That was recognized 40 years

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:04.860
 ago that the seed oils are biological defense.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:16.940
 It almost seems like if somebody kept in their mind that, you know, we did evolve from an

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:21.180
 equatorial area and that we do need lots of sunlight and we do need certain types of food,

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:25.540
 they could actually kind of guide you. It's like so many people just don't get it that

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:30.740
 they're not getting enough sunlight when they're further north. It's almost like if they were

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:39.900
 reminded that your organism actually is adapted to an equatorial situation that they would

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.660
 think more about that, you know?

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:55.020
 And previously when it was summer in the high latitudes, people were outside farming, herding

00:34:55.020 --> 00:35:02.460
 the sheep or whatever, getting lots of sunlight exposure. And in the last hundred years, people

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:10.540
 have sort of moved indoors and gotten sicker, I think largely from deficiency of sunlight.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:14.820
 I don't want to interrupt too much here, but we do have three other callers on the line,

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:18.060
 so I just want to be fair to make sure everyone gets a fair chance.

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.620
 Okay, thank you.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.260
 Yeah, thank you for your question and thank you, Dr. Peete. Let's move on to the next

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:29.780
 person so the other two get a chance. Next caller, you're on the air. And where are you

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:30.780
 from?

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:31.780
 From Arcata, California.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:37.900
 Okay, yeah, go ahead. What's your question?

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:47.980
 You were going to talk about fish oil, and I've taken fish oil and I'm hearing that you

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:56.380
 were going to talk about the negative effect, that it's not all correct.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:01.660
 Yeah, it's unfortunate for you that the research that's out there does not make it to the popular

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:08.060
 mainstream as quickly as it would be good if it did. It's certainly taking a U-turn

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:12.820
 now. I know, Dr. Peete, you spent quite a lot of your life researching the polyunsaturates

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:18.900
 and how damaging they are. If you want to briefly give the gentleman caller a synopsis

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:23.140
 of the polyunsaturated, especially the fish oil and how damaging it is for you, I think

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.820
 it would be good for him to hear that.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:35.900
 The majority of the oils that we store are unsaturated. Our cells prefer to oxidize saturated

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:43.980
 fats and so even when we eat a mixed fat diet, our tissues with aging tend to load up on

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:55.620
 the unsaturated. And the N-3 fats, the double bonds are farther from the acidic end, which

00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:06.100
 is what is handled biologically. And the acid end protects against oxidation. So the N-3

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:13.300
 fats are more unstable in the presence of oxygen and so we don't store so much of those.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:21.340
 So with aging, our bloodstream, every time we're slightly stressed, our bloodstream

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:33.940
 gets a fairly high concentration of N-6 fatty acids, which produce the toxic prostaglandins

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:44.220
 that produce brain cell damage and inflammation and so on. And so if you take a meal of fish

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:53.360
 or eat some fish oil, these oxidize very quickly and form compounds that will interfere with

00:37:53.360 --> 00:38:01.460
 the formation of prostaglandins. But in doing that, they're also suppressing the immune

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:10.020
 system, but you get temporary relief to the extent that you're overloaded with the most

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:20.140
 toxic N-6 fatty acids. So people experience some relief of inflammation when they take

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:31.100
 fish oil, but in the long run, that's doing its own damage because it's so highly oxidizable.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:40.500
 In some experiments, the N-3 fats increased the metastatic spread of cancer cells.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.660
 Okay, did you get that, Carla?

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:51.060
 Yes, I did. What would you recommend for as something that would, a substance that we

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:58.980
 take that would promote healthy brain function or maybe even the regeneration of brain cells

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:05.900
 and that, and fish oil?

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:11.100
 Well I know that Dr. Peet definitely espouses the saturated fats as very protective, both

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:17.020
 stabilizing cell membranes, being cardiovascularly protective, which is not what you'll hear

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:22.740
 if you read the newspapers or magazine articles. But in terms of anti-inflammatory effects,

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:27.540
 the saturated fats are definitely better in the brain function for stabilizing the membranes

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:33.420
 and the saturated fats are certainly going to be the protective compounds. So coconut

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:40.180
 oil, palm oil, butter, animal fat, and I've got to say a caveat to add to the statement

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:44.620
 animal fat, you need to make sure the animal is certified organic, otherwise most of all

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:51.260
 the residues of whatever pesticides or hormones or antibiotics they're treated with will wind

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:55.220
 up in their fat, so you don't want to eat the fat of a non-organic animal.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:40:02.220
 But it depends on what the animals were being fed. Chickens are highly polyunsaturated,

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:11.340
 pork for the last 50 years has been very full of polyunsaturated fats, even though lots

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:22.020
 of science papers are treating lard as a saturated fat with 35% or so of PUFA in it, it's definitely

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.580
 a risky fat.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:28.780
 Okay, so we do have three more callers on the line Dr. Pete, so thank you for your call

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:33.700
 and let's move on to the next callers. So next one, you're on the air, where are you

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.700
 from? Hello?

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:35.700
 Is it me?

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.700
 Yeah, you're on the air, where are you from?

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.340
 Alright, up on Bell Springs.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.460
 Okay, very local. What's your question?

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:46.940
 Okay, my question has to do with breast health and I know you're going to address that in

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:55.500
 the program. What I would like to ask is that you address urea in reference to breast health

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.500
 and particularly fibroids.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:02.980
 Okay, Dr. Pete, did you hear that? The reference to breast health and fibroids and the benefits

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:08.500
 of urea?

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:19.820
 I don't know of any particular treatments or programs for those with urea, but the diet

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:31.260
 that favors the formation of urea rather than its antithesis nitric oxide, it happens that

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:44.300
 the amino acid arginine can either form nitric oxide or urea and irritants, anything toxic

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:54.900
 tends to shift it away from forming urea and going to nitric oxide. So avoiding the polyunsaturated

00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:01.260
 fats helps you maintain the proper amount of urea formation.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:06.540
 Okay, because Carlo, I don't know if you heard the earlier part of the show, I wasn't making

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:10.100
 a reference or we weren't making references to urea specifically to breast health, but

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.980
 we were, if we have the time here, otherwise we'll do it next month, we were going to get

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:21.700
 into the common lies and mistakes that people are told about polyunsaturated oils and estrogen

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:26.540
 and its supposed health benefits because there's plenty of scientific evidence to show that

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:31.660
 estrogen is actually very damaging and that in terms of breast health and fibroids, I

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:35.820
 know Dr. Pete, you would agree that estrogen is probably one of the main contributory factors

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:36.820
 for fibroids?

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:45.540
 Oh, oh definitely. Low thyroid causes the ratio of estrogen to progesterone and androgens

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:57.020
 to be very high and both endometriosis, uterine fibroids and also breast fibrocystic disease,

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:03.420
 all of these go with high estrogen, low progesterone and low thyroid function.

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:07.620
 Okay, Carla, does that help in any way?

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:13.140
 Yeah, it does. Thank you very much. I just was curious because cancers are being talked

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:18.780
 about in relation to urea, if it also would then be translated to breast as well. So that

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.180
 did answer it. Thank you so much.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:26.500
 Okay, you're welcome. So like I said, if we get a chance here, we'll get into the estrogen,

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:30.100
 negative effects of estrogen and talk about isoflavones, but we do have a couple more

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:35.060
 callers. So let's take this next caller. Caller, you're on the air and where are you from?

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.060
 Hello?

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.060
 Hi, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:40.740
 Hi, I'm over the hill by Alder Point.

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.540
 Okay, and what's your question?

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:51.220
 About insomnia. I take three blood pressure pills for high blood pressure and I sleep

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:58.580
 maybe one to two hours and it takes me an hour to two hours to go back to sleep and

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:08.620
 I'm just exhausted. I can't nap. I get anxiety attacks. I have shingles and I heard that

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:12.620
 tart cherry juice, one to two ounces, helps sleep.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.860
 What was that again? What was that product again?

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:22.460
 Tart cherry juice. I heard that on Dr. Oz. I haven't tried that. But everything I've

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:26.140
 tried over the counter, medications, nothing helps.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:29.140
 No, I bet. Dr. Pete, you're going to say this is a...

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:33.940
 I'm exhausted. I'll take my answer off the air that way I could write.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:38.060
 Sure. Okay, Dr. Pete, it's probably an over adrenaline situation, but how would you best

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:44.100
 describe to this lady what she could do to get some sleep?

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.340
 Having a test for thyroid function is important.

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.420
 Oh, my sister has grave disease.

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:57.020
 There you go. Go ahead, Dr. Pete.

00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:07.780
 Blood sugar is always a problem at night. The effect of daylight is to maintain efficient

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:17.820
 oxidative metabolism and just 15 minutes of darkness is enough to lower the efficiency

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:24.940
 of mitochondrial respiration. And so keeping very bright lights right up until bedtime

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:34.620
 will minimize the fall of blood sugar. But having a carbohydrate meal late in the afternoon

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:47.460
 or before bed, a glass of orange juice or milk with honey, sometimes just the dose of

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:53.700
 sugar is enough to put you to sleep for an hour and a half or two hours. It takes time

00:45:53.700 --> 00:46:00.060
 for the liver to start storing glycogen. So it's good to have another glass ready for

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:08.700
 when you wake up, have another dose of orange juice or milk and sugar. And salty things,

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:15.900
 salty snacks at bedtime help to stabilize the blood sugar and energy production. So

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:24.980
 like milk and maybe salty tortilla chips or puffed pork rinds, something, a salty snack

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:25.980
 as well as a...

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.980
 Even with high blood pressure, you think it's okay?

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:31.980
 It's...

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:37.340
 They've got it so low now.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:46.020
 You have to take into account what drug you're taking. But vitamin K is a very important

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:54.620
 nutrient for regulating blood sugar, blood calcium and blood pressure. I've known people

00:46:54.620 --> 00:47:07.020
 who in a week or two lowered their blood pressure by 100 points, 240 to 140 systolic pressure.

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.780
 Really from taking vitamin K?

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:16.700
 Yeah. And so you have to, if you're already at normal blood pressure, you have to be cautious

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:21.180
 and watch what's happening if you supplement large amounts of vitamin K.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:25.460
 How much would I take in milligrams? I don't know how much.

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:30.980
 Five or 10 milligrams is a pretty safe dose.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.980
 How about vitamin D?

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:41.300
 That's essential. If you aren't getting regular sunlight or using a D supplement, you probably

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:51.540
 should have a blood test because low blood vitamin D, down around 20 on the scale should

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:56.580
 be around 50 points. Between 30 and 100 is the normal range.

00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:02.300
 Okay. I'm sorry to interrupt. So just get a complete blood panel like?

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:08.300
 Well, you have to ask for a specific vitamin D3 test.

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:12.300
 Oh, vitamin D3 test. Okay.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:19.900
 And you don't want the activated vitamin D. It's the 25-hydroxycholecalciferol that you

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:29.140
 want to measure. And that's very important. Both vitamin K and vitamin D prevent the excitatory

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:35.820
 excess. And so it's essential to have your calcium regulated.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:42.820
 Can I ask you how I could speak to you? Do you have an office in Garberville?

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:48.500
 Dr. Peete doesn't have an office in Garberville, but I do. If you wanted to, you could consult

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:53.420
 with me at any point in time. You can just contact me Monday through Friday. I'll give

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:57.780
 the number out at the end of the show. Okay, great. Thank you very, very much.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.780
 You're welcome. I appreciate your time.

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:00.780
 You're welcome. Bye-bye.

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:05.780
 Thank you. We do have two more callers on the air, so let's take the next caller.

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:06.780
 Caller, you're on the air. Hello.

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:07.780
 And where are you from? Hi, you're on the air.

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:14.780
 Okay, I've got a couple of questions. One, I want to know about this urea, if it's so

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:19.540
 good for cancer, and you say even cancer of the liver, I know liver cancer is very difficult

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.780
 to treat. Why is this not a more popular treatment?

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:28.340
 Yeah, it's a good question. I don't know. I don't want to say it's conspiracy, but I

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:32.860
 think sometimes simple things get buried. And I think the truth of that is that when

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:38.540
 things are so simple, they'll quickly get buried under a paper of a pile of papers that

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:43.060
 are supporting the latest and greatest treatments. And as we know, there is no real treatment

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:47.620
 for cancer. I think the cancer industry probably has one of the worst track records going for

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:50.160
 cures. Well, it seems like, I mean, I have a friend

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:55.900
 that got over cancer with radiation and chemotherapy, and she beat it, and she had a couple of large

00:49:55.900 --> 00:50:02.580
 tumors. So these things do work, maybe not always 100%, but more than they used to.

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:09.500
 Yeah, I think there's lots of things to look out for, though, in terms of relapses with

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:16.220
 initial treatments. But that's not to say that everybody gets a relapse and ends up

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:23.300
 with cancer down the line. The five-year mortality for cancers are post-operative are pretty

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:27.060
 poor in most cases. There are not many cancers that are that truly resolved.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:32.780
 Well, they get a little time anyway. If they don't do anything, they die.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:38.980
 Well, yeah. Now, the other thing I wanted to know is I

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:47.100
 was taking something called glucosamine MSM for joint flexibility. What is this MSM? Do

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:51.420
 you know what that is? They said it was a sulfur that your cells needed or something.

00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:55.980
 Is that important to take as a supplement? It is a sulfur compound, but I don't know

00:50:55.980 --> 00:51:01.140
 what it is, Dr. Peet. Dr. Peet, what do you have to say about MSM?

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:08.540
 I think you should be very cautious and read some of the actual research articles on PubMed

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:16.700
 about it. And the glucosamine, which was the...

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:21.220
 Glucosamine with MSM.

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:32.260
 The glucosamine is suspected of being a factor in creating diabetes if you take too much

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.500
 of it for too long.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:39.260
 But what about the MSM? What is the problem with that?

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:40.780
 It can be toxic in itself.

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:47.780
 Toxic? How? I mean, and how much would that be?

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:56.780
 Because what they told me was that it was something that your cells needed to be healthy.

00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:06.020
 No, cells definitely don't need it, but it's tolerated in fairly large amounts, but it

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:07.980
 can also be toxic in those amounts.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.580
 Okay, so what are the amounts that are safe?

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:12.580
 Well, I wouldn't...

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:16.540
 You don't know? Okay, the other one thing I want to ask you, you know, you were saying

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:24.060
 that fish oil is not so good, but I heard that fish oil, like omega-3s, are really good

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.940
 for the heart. What do you think about that?

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:36.660
 No, the studies have all ended up pretty negative.

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:43.300
 What studies are negative?

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:52.540
 When it's used for a short period, you can do things like lowering cholesterol and lowering

00:52:52.540 --> 00:53:00.700
 blood pressure, but it ends up with the toxic immune suppressive effects.

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:08.180
 And it also has thyroid suppressive effects, very negatively impacting the energy supply

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.180
 and the energy production.

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:15.420
 Are you saying that the omega-3 lowers the thyroid function?

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:17.420
 Yeah, and it's specifically thyrotoxic.

00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:18.420
 Really?

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:19.420
 Yeah.

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:20.420
 I have to take thyroid.

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:27.500
 Yeah. Okay, so they produce the byproducts of these polyunsaturated oils. The lipofruscine

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:33.820
 is one of the main thyroid suppressive compounds. And indeed, as Dr. Peet says, whilst in the

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:42.020
 short term, somebody who has plaque psoriasis may benefit from it, the actual reason for

00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:47.020
 it is that the immune system itself is being impacted negatively and suppressed. And so

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:51.780
 therefore there's not such excitation going on with rapid cell turnover in the immune

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:52.780
 system.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:53.780
 Well, why is it so popular?

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.340
 It's so popular because it's an extremely profitable product.

00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:58.340
 Like margarine?

00:53:58.340 --> 00:53:59.340
 It's a waste product.

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:04.540
 Okay, and one more thing. Sesame tahini, that's made out of sesame seeds. Is that...

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:10.460
 The same problem. It's a liquid oil. It's polyunsaturated. People don't get oil out

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:16.180
 of nuts and seeds. It just doesn't happen. It's very small amounts. And so to consume

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:23.500
 either sesame or Brazil nut or peanut or whatever nut oil is consuming a lot of the product

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:27.740
 that you'd never normally get exposed to. And this is the whole rationale behind understanding

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:29.940
 the negative impacts of these oils, is that...

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:33.540
 So you don't think that sesame seeds have good stuff for you?

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:39.300
 No, no, none of it. It's a very, very rancid, very easily rancified. They're extremely quickly

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:45.660
 oxidized and turn into a sticky goo on the top of the jar. Anybody can take the top of

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:49.700
 a canola jar or a fish oil bottle and you'll see how sticky it is. And that's because your

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:54.180
 oil has been so quickly oxidized. In your body, that same thing happens and that oxidative

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.460
 damage is extremely damaging.

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:59.300
 Well, you can tell if it's rancid by the smell and the taste. It's very obvious.

00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:02.900
 Coconut oil does not go rancid. You could keep coconut oil for years and it will not

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:04.940
 go rancid because it's so stable.

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:06.940
 Are any nuts good for you?

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:10.380
 Not really. Well, I think one of the only nuts maybe that might be worth a mention perhaps

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:14.460
 is the Mauna Loa produced macadamia nuts.

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:18.340
 Well, I was seeing on Dr. Oz that he said the cashew nuts were very healthy.

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:21.140
 Yeah, no, unfortunately not.

00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:27.380
 Okay, okay. And what about CoQ10? Is that a good thing to take?

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:30.380
 Dr. Peay, what do you have to say about CoQ10? I think you would take it.

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:37.140
 I think it is good. It works with vitamin K to stabilize energy production.

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:41.140
 Okay, does vitamin K help vitamin D work better?

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:48.420
 Yeah, they both do different things, but they regulate calcium and vitamin K has that extra

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.540
 function of stabilizing energy and brain chemistry.

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:54.540
 All right, well, thank you very much. Bye-bye.

00:55:54.540 --> 00:56:00.780
 Thank you. We do have another caller, but if we can get this next caller, next question

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:05.020
 asked and answered in a couple of minutes, Dr. Peay, that would be great. Go ahead, caller.

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:06.500
 You're on the air. Where are you from?

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:12.060
 Yes, hello. I'm calling from Bellevue, Idaho, and I'd like to know, you've discussed how

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:19.180
 it takes four years to change the saturated fat ratio of your cells to a healthy range.

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:23.420
 What if you're overweight? Then does it take longer to achieve this healthy ratio?

00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.420
 Yeah.

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:30.100
 Yeah. So, okay, Dr. Peay, how would you suggest that somebody who was, I don't know this person

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:34.380
 is, but if somebody was obese, for example, and they had all this excess body fat, which

00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:42.420
 naturally would be pretty highly unsaturated, how would they go about changing the composition

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:47.100
 of their fat, not only by changing their diet to only include saturated fats, but how would

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:51.860
 they gently exercise and lose weight to do that safely?

00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:59.220
 Having your thyroid at the right level is one thing, and supplementing vitamin E, because

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:05.740
 when you're losing stored fat, it's going to travel through your bloodstream, and so

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:12.820
 you want to have a steady supply of vitamin E coming in. Maybe 50 milligrams a day would

00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:23.300
 help. And a lot of fruit, orange juice, for example, has safe antioxidants besides vitamin

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:33.300
 C that protect your blood vessels as the fat is being removed. And keeping your temperature

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:44.820
 steady at 98.6 or close to it during the daytime keeps you burning your energy productively

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:46.420
 rather than destructively.

00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:50.220
 Okay. So, Carla, there you go.

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:58.980
 Well, then, as long as you retain the weight, then you still have an issue, then, with unsaturated

00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:01.860
 fat cells. Is that correct?

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:11.020
 Yeah. When you lose the fat, you're going to expose your tissues to that polyunsaturated

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:18.740
 fat that is in storage. And if you keep your liver energetic with a good diet, enough protein,

00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:24.980
 80 to 100 grams a day of good protein, and keep your thyroid function up, your liver

00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:33.980
 will be able to dispose of some of that unsaturated fat as a toxin without having to oxidize it.

00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:39.900
 So, gentle exercise, keep yourself warm, make sure your thyroid function is working well,

00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:45.540
 consume saturated fats, lots of OJ and other fructose-containing fruits and/or fruit juices

00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:51.220
 to speed up your metabolism, and then coconut oil, obviously, as a thermogenic alternative

00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.420
 to polyunsaturated fat.

00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:58.460
 Okay. Well, unfortunately, that's all we have time for. So, thanks to those people that

00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:05.140
 have called in. I just want to give people a reminder of how they can find more of Dr.

00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:09.540
 Pete's reference material on site. Thank you so much for joining us, Dr. Pete.

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:10.860
 Okay. Thank you.

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:19.580
 Okay. So, on the internet, www.raypeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com, lots of scholarly articles,

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:24.900
 fully referenced research material. It's not hocus-pocus. It's all research material. So,

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:31.380
 just like Dr. Danopoulos with the stunning results with liver cancer as well as skin

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:37.500
 cancers and ocular cancers, there's lots of alternatives out there, and it's not wacko.

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:41.020
 It's just unfortunate it's not mainstream, but that's because it doesn't make too much

00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:42.300
 money, I suspect.

00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:46.900
 Anyway, for those of you who have joined us, thanks so much for tuning in. We'll be back

00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:51.460
 next month, third Friday of the month, from 7 till 8 p.m.

00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:58.100
 My name's Andrew Murray. We can be reached 1-888-WBM-ERB for consultations or further

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.540
 questions Monday through Friday. Good night.

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:01.760
