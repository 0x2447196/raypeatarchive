 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 And for those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show which runs every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8pm,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herb extracts which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 or which are sourced from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 So as per usual, I've still got the same intro but Sarah is not joining me today.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Garboville 91.1 FM

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions either related

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 or unrelated to this month's subject of environmental enrichment.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Amongst other things, we're going to cover a few other topics of interest as well as look at a couple of recent articles

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 that have caused a bit of a stir and that we are going to refute for the bad science they contain.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 The number if you live in the area is 923 3911.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 So from 7.30 to 8 o'clock onwards, call is very welcome to call in with any questions about the show's content

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 either this month's or any previous content they might have questions about.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 If you live outside the area, there's a toll free number is 1800 KMUD RAD which is 1-800-568-3723.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 So once again, very welcome to introduce a seemingly permanent fixture to the show, thankfully, for his wisdom.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Dr. Peat, thank you for joining us.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Hi.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Okay, I guess as always, I'd like you just to give an introduction of your academic background

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 for perhaps those people who've just tuned into the show and have never heard you before.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 In the 60s, I taught biology and literature and painting and various things.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 But then I went to graduate school at 1968 to 72 studying biochemistry, reproductive, aging, physiology in general.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 And since then I've been continuing some of the same projects that I started back in the late 60s.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Okay, and you're fairly prolific. I think that's the right word in terms of producing newsletters that can be accessed by people wanting to make a subscription to your newsletters.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 And also you're a pretty constant and avid researcher of topics, both old and new, finding out the truth, if you like, about where the science is coming from.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 And that leads me on to a couple of articles I wanted to discuss.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 I wanted you to discuss the bad science portion of the articles because one of them caused a fair amount of stir in as much as the topics that we've talked about in the past.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Things like salt being good for you and sugar being good for you and saturated fats being good for you.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 The saturated fat seems to be working its way to the surface now with the medical establishment seemingly doing a U-turn on the polyunsaturates, saying that the polyunsaturates are bad for you now.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Actually, the saturated fats are good for you. And hopefully in time here, the same thing will happen with sugar.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 But recently there's been an article that was published that seemed to shoot down the benefits of sugar and it was done with mice.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 And they were using two different groups of mice.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 The bottom line of the article was that it was calling sugar poisonous and was saying that it had the same kind of effects in terms of the results as when they tested mouse groups that were inbred.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 And that the same negative effects were present in the sugar group as were in the mouse group that were inbred in terms of their ability to control territory and dominate others as signs of their healthiness and their ability to find the best place to sleep and mate with the best females.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 So you're familiar with that study done in Utah, the University in Utah, that said that sugar was bad for the mice and it caused an early death and all sorts of things.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Yeah, it just came out a couple days ago and people have been contacting me about it because it basically says that the amount of sugar, fructose and sucrose in three sweetened drinks that Americans, a large part of the population, average that many per day,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 that that amount given to mice causes extremely high mortality.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 The next best thing to rat poison for the high rate of mortality in a period of I think it was 32 weeks or 36 weeks, 35% of the sugar reared females died and only 17% of the so-called stock diet females died.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 That sounds bad on the face of it, doesn't it? You're going to explain the science behind the findings.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Yeah, twice as many deaths in this fairly moderate period of time just from drinking the equivalent of three sodas.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 And that was so weird and extreme. I looked up what that group had been doing before this study and they were working on, as you mentioned, inbreeding.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 And they found that the inbred mice had a high mortality and aggression was designed into their living arrangement so that they thought of it as accelerated evolution apparently in which the survival of the meanest would be evident in a very short time.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 And it happened several years ago, just a year or two before they switched from their inbreeding studies to the sugar study.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 There were three or four papers published showing that a diet enriched in starch and polyunsaturated fats powerfully increased aggression and mouse killing in rats.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 So the connection between starch, polyunsaturated fats and aggression was clearly established and they had an environmental setup that allowed aggression to kill off part of the population fairly quickly.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 And so I don't think it was just an objective study of the effect of sugar because the so-called stock diet consisting of some grains and soy protein or soy flour and corn starch added 25% corn starch.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 So the grains contained the polyunsaturated fats and it was a model of the aggression promoting diet but they didn't mention that in their publicity about the fact that the so-called normal diet allowed higher survival in the females than the sugar rearing diet with the equivalent of three sodas per day.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 So what they did was create an arrangement in which feeding one group of animals so that they became aggressive, the setup was such that they could take over the food supply, the nesting arrangement and generally bully the weaker animals.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 So that extremely high mortality is not produced by drinking three sodas a day.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 It would be if you had to associate the sugar reared population with the population living on starch and polyunsaturated fats and they injured the passive people.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 Can you hear any buzzing on the line? How's this phone line to you Dr. Peat?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 So far it's perfect.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Good. I just heard the buzz. Maybe it was just on my end.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 So unfortunately, as another example of some skewed science to produce results in the direction that was favorable to the outcome which was that sugar was bad for you when actually it was not modeled correctly and the actual findings weren't realistic.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Okay, so that's the first thing and then there was another article from a study done in Italy which referenced the intake of T4, specifically Synthroid which is a fairly common prescription for thyroid deficiency and a link between Synthroid use and lung cancer.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 So that caused again a little bit of a stir given that quite a few people were using Synthroid for low thyroid function.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 In terms of Synthroid's use and its activity as a compound, what did you find about that study that was erroneous?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 There were animal studies with lung cancer specifically that are very relevant to that and they found that T3, the active thyroid hormone, inhibited the growth of the cancer cells but that T4 increased their growth and increased the metastatic ability of them.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 And that's similar to some studies that started about 30 years ago published in JAMA.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 There was a study in I think it was the late 80s studying a group of five women who had been treated for hypothyroidism with T4 only such as Synthroid, comparing them to a group of women who weren't given any thyroid supplement.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 So they had chosen a group of hypothyroid women and reported that the ones who received the T4 or Synthroid had a higher rate of osteoporosis.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 But since low thyroid is compensated by high cortisone and high prolactin and other stress hormones which cause bone problems including osteoporosis,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 what they were doing was looking at a population with a deficient thyroid problem treated insufficiently with something like 100 micrograms of T4.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 And it has been known for decades that women are much less able to convert T4 or Synthroid into the active hormone.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 So it's especially inappropriate for treating women with hypothyroidism to give them only T4.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 Okay, from a perspective of being stimulant to turn up oxidative stress in terms of T4's activity, I don't think you're not really an advocate of just using T4 anyway in terms of its physiological effect and its usefulness.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 In general, both of the thyroid hormones, if you can convert the thyroxine into T3, they both can have a very important anti-oxidative damage function.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 By increasing the rate of useful oxidation, they keep electrons from escaping from the electron transport chain in the mitochondrion and prevent the random oxidative damage.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Just uncoupling the production of energy so you're wasting oxygen and fuel with some drugs, for example, that used to be used for weight loss which activated the oxidation the way thyroid does but without producing useful energy.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 Even that kind of uncoupling is known to reduce oxidative damage.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 So when you're finding increased oxidative breakdown products when you give T4, it shows that you're not activating oxidative metabolism the way thyroid normally does.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 You're interfering in some way with the respiratory system.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Thank you for that. Those two articles, like I said, caused a bit of a stir but obviously they're not in the right context.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 You're listening to Ask Your Ob Doctor on KMUD Garbaville, 91.1 FM, from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Callers are invited to come in with any questions they have either about tonight's subject or previous subjects.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 The number if you live in the area is 9233911. If you live outside the area there's a 1-800-568-3723 number.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 Let's move on to the main topic of tonight. The subject of environmental enrichment in terms of negating the effects, if you like, or staving off the effects of brain atrophy and also the reference to Alzheimer's.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 Seeing that this enrichment now is proposed as a new approach, if you like, for the treatment of Alzheimer's, another neurodegenerative disease where lab findings show an association between Alzheimer's and increased levels of destructive inflammatory mediators like nitric oxide and cortisol as well as prostaglandins.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 What do you know about this topic of environmental enrichment and its perspective to energy and anti-inflammation?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 That observation that Alzheimer's people have drastically reduced living variety, they tend not to socialize as much as people who are resistant to Alzheimer's,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 that started me thinking about the general range of stimulation and animal studies beyond simple more or less voluntary isolation that old people often develop the habit of just staying at home and watching television or something.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Beyond that, animal studies did various things, isolation at different ages, separating the baby animals from their mothers right after weaning, giving them solitary confinement until they're middle-aged,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 and even tightening up their environment to the point of holding them so they can't do anything at all.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 There's a gradient all the way from living in a playground basically with slides and wheels and various colored objects, balls to push around and so on, all the way down to being rolled up in a blanket so you can't move.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 But you see the same things happening. The worse the stress is, the smaller the brain gets.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 Depression is known to increase cortisol and cause atrophy of all of the tissues and that includes the brain.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 So they see that after about three years of just being psychologically depressed, people show a smaller reduction of the brain volume.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Animal studies starting in the 1960s at University of California, Berkeley, they first found that animals given stimulation, a big playground to roam in when they weren't eating and sleeping, they found that they learned better, could solve problems better.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 So they examined their brains to see what was happening and they found that the enzyme cholinesterase was increased in proportion to how much they were stimulated and how well they learned.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 They kept that study going on generation after generation and found that it not only increased this enzyme that destroys acetylcholine, it involved enlargement of the whole brain, especially the cortex.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 Each generation, both the enzyme increased and the brain got larger.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 So it's passed on. Yeah, in a physiological sort of inheritance, which is getting some study now in the last 10 years. But at the time, they were just interested in the fact that the environment could cause these major biological changes, especially in the brain.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 But a lot of people said, "Well, if you're destroying acetylcholine at a higher rate and the brain gets bigger, that must mean you have more activity of the cholinergic nerves making acetylcholine."

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 But that isn't what they found. They found that the enzyme that destroys it was increased as the brain got bigger.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 That kind of reasoning without facts shifted over to thinking about the deterioration of the brain in Alzheimer's disease.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 They saw that there was less tissue in parts of the brain, especially in the cholinergic part.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 No one suggested that maybe overexposure to acetylcholine might have something to do with why the nerves atrophied, because the various stress signals increase the various factors that cause brain shrinkage.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 So, they proposed poisoning the enzyme called anesterase, which was associated in the animal studies with increased intelligence, memory, and brain growth.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 They proposed doing just the opposite, poisoning that enzyme to increase the amount of acetylcholine in the brain.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 The enzyme was tacrine, the name of the chemical. Several studies by the late 90s, they were seeing that it did absolutely nothing for the Alzheimer's dementia, but it did cause a terrifically high incidence of liver disease.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 In the 70s, it happened that Parkinson's disease was, they were looking around for other things than L-DOPA to treat it with because that didn't work too well.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 Some virus treatment investigations had found that a derivative of camphor or a similar compound that was used to cure herpes and influenza also had nerve protective action.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 They thought, why not use this amandidine or adamantine amine to treat Parkinson's disease?

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 They found that it did benefit Parkinson's disease, which involved, among other things, an excess of acetylcholine.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 This amandidine was known right from the time of the virus studies, it was known to be an anti-cholinergic drug.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 It was recognized as an anti-cholinergic when it was being used to improve Parkinson's patients.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 But the Alzheimer's people, seeing the success with Parkinson's disease, wanted to try it in their population.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 But since they were already treating with something that increased the cholinergic acetylcholine, they couldn't very well switch right over to something absolutely the opposite to inhibit the cholinergic system.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 So they suddenly discovered that as well as being anti-cholinergic, amandidine and a very similar amandine, they found that they also inhibit the excitotoxins, the glutamate aspartate excitatory system.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 So suddenly this anti-cholinergic drug became an anti-excitatory drug and was fit to be used in Alzheimer's patients in combination with tacrine or the galantamine or other drugs to poison the enzyme which this new drug was activating.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Wow. Do you know, these two compounds you mentioned, tacrine and galantamine?

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 Well, amandidine and memantinine, are they still prescribable drugs?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Oh yeah, amandidine I think is now a standard Alzheimer's treatment along with whatever toxin of the cholinesterase inhibiting.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 So this was, because I was always, I mean in terms of my physiology studying herbal medicine, I was always taught that acetylcholine was a very important neurotransmitter and it was mopped up in a synaptic cleft by acetylcholine esterase and that prevented any overstimulation firing.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 So, for what you were just discussing right now, we're talking about a kind of excess situation where there's an excess?

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 Yeah, inescapable stress, the stress hormones rather than pushing higher and higher on the cortisol and adrenaline direction to excite things, run the heart at a faster rate.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 The body shifts when it sees futility, inability to escape.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 It can simply switch gears and turn off that system and turn on the acetylcholine cholinergic system.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 And the confinement inescapable stress, which is the extreme of isolation, the extreme opposite from enriched environment, this turns on the cholinergic dominant system,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 which lowers blood sugar and in consequence, lowering the blood sugar activates histamine release.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 Some of the acetylcholine nerves, such as the vagus nerve, amplify their influence by releasing histamine, which is very similar in its effects to acetylcholine.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 So, you can think of this kind of inescapable stress as turning on the histamine type of cholinergic reaction.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 So, this is really a kind of death situation. This would be going towards death and away from life?

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 Yeah.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 Biologically?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 In the learned helplessness experiments of the 60s, Martin Seligman is the person who made that famous.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 He's now doing military research.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 Whoops.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 He found that if you almost drowned a rat but saved it, even the rats that saw it being saved would swim on for days before they drowned.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 And if you put the saved rat back in, the experience of being saved would cause it to swim much longer than the average rat, which might give up after a day.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 That sounds like the seed of hope to me.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Yeah, but if you simply held the rat in your hand until it got the idea that it was powerless, one experience of being unable to escape, you would drop it in the water and it would basically drown in 30 minutes.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 Wow, wow, far out. Go ahead.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 The state of the heart, they found, was in a turned off state, basically a cholinergic anti-mobilization energy state.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 Wow. We do have a couple of callers, obviously. Thanks for that explanation. That's pretty profound.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 So, let's take the first caller. You're on the air?

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Is that me, please?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 Yeah, you're on the air. And where are you calling from?

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 From Oregon House, California, which is close to Nevada City.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 Yes, the first question has to do with toe fungus. Dr. Peat, you mentioned in the past that sulfur was good for fungus, and I was just wondering if it would work with toe fungus and if I should use some DMFO to get it in there.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 And the second was, I was wondering about your thoughts on irradiation of food.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 There's a 10% sulfur soap sold at drugstores. They might not stock it on the shelf because it's too cheap, but it works very well for an athlete's foot, anywhere on the body.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 This is a bit deeper than an athlete's foot. It's actually in the nail bed.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Yeah, once it gets into the nail, it's very hard to get anything in there. But it's possible that DMFO would help it penetrate through the nail.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 But the fungus actually lives right inside the thick nail material.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 I have been using a Dremel to thin it out as much as I can bear, but I'll try that too. So about irradiation of food, do you have any thoughts about that?

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 Yeah, it's been known for a long time that it breaks down all of the fragile, easily oxidized nutrients, changes some of the amino acids, turns tryptophan into some toxins.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 The advocates of it, the radiation waste disposal industry, it's a good way to get rid of radioactive waste, put it into factories.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 They do studies and claim that it almost doesn't change the food at all.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 It seems like the idea behind it, in part at least, is that they could supposedly drop their sanitation standards to zero and then rely on the radiation to kill bacteria.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Yeah, but it does, it changes the flavor fairly drastically. It gives it a rancid flavor almost instantly.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 But the public gets accustomed to degraded food.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 Okay, well thanks very much.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 Thank you for that cool caller. Okay, do we have any other? Yeah, Michael, let's take the next caller please.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 Yeah, hi, I'm calling from the Saline Creek Watershed and I got a question about kava, that you know, supposedly the most powerful anxiolytic there is.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 Am I on air? Hello? Yeah, you're on the air, I can hear you.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 And all of the studies done, I went to an herb school in the eastern part of the country and you know, it was my teacher's favorite herb also and it's something that I use chronically.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 I guess, yeah, anyways, the thing that I'm curious about is like I've heard that a lot of the studies done that say that it has liver damage were done on like, you know, like one of those studies where they gave the above ground parts instead of just the below ground parts.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 I'm just curious about your thoughts and opinions on that and if you know anything about that study.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Yeah, I do. The parts that I use anyway are the roots and the study that showed this, another good example of skewed science,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 showed the hepatotoxic effects of kava were actually done with a hexane extract of kava kava and actually the hexane was probably more carcinogenic than anything else.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 In terms of its use in Fiji and parts of the tropical Philippines where they grow kava and use kava in Hawaii to, you know, ceremoniously,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 there's no real recorded incidence of any liver toxic effects of it so you would think, I know that's probably an aqueous extract so I don't think they use ethanol to extract it which it is typically extracted in a 45% or 60% ethanol.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 You can definitely make, I've definitely made fresh kava tincture with 95% and it works great.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 Yeah, well that was the main bit of science that came out was with the hexane extract and I believe it was to animals, it was in an animal study so I think it was a rat or mouse study that showed liver damage and the liver damage almost exclusively was done to the hexane.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 Well, do you see any long-term negative effects of using kava tonically?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 I can't say that I've witnessed any long-term effects myself. I know a lot of people use it for skeletal muscle relaxation, that's its main indication is to relax skeletal muscle which is why it's termed an anxiolytic.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 Yeah, I think ceremoniously when it's used it's probably ingested in large amounts and so I think it does have a fairly profound relaxing activity.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 If you were to use kava kava in a quote therapeutic sense, the dose would probably be nowhere near as much and you'd probably experience some general anxiolytic action but not as profound perhaps as you would if you were in a kava ceremony.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 Totally, I feel like the way it makes your mouth tingle it makes your whole mind and body tingle too, that's how it works.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 Yep, that's the hallmark of kava.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 Well, thanks for your input.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 Yeah, you're very welcome.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 Have a good one, bye.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 Yeah, thank you for calling.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 Okay, we have another caller on the line, let's take the next caller.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 Hello?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 Yes, I want to ask something in regard to the thyroid. Now my situation is my thyroid is a bit low and they have me on 88 micrograms of something I think they call levothyroxine.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Yeah, levothyroxine.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 Okay, is that the same as the synthroid?

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 Yeah, it's T4.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 Okay, it's T4. All right, now, yeah, sometimes I get the 3 and the 4 mixed up. And I asked the doctor, the endocrinologist, do I need to take the T3 as well as the T4 and he said that we convert T4 into T3 automatically.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 Yeah, well.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 Is that true? Do we do that?

00:38:50.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 Well, the reason women have 5 to 10 times the number of thyroid problems of all sorts than men do is that their liver is relatively unable to convert T4 to the active T3 hormone efficiently.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 In the 1940s when T4 was synthesized and brought out as a product, it was tested on male medical students and it worked in them just the same as armor thyroid extract. But they didn't bother testing it on a female population which...

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 Well, I've been having tests fairly regularly to see how it's doing and they keep telling me that my thyroid is now normal.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 Well, the old normal concentration in the blood of T4 and T3 when the gland was producing it and the liver was activating it or when a person was using armor thyroid as a supplement, the ratio...

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 Well, I'm not using that. So, I mean, is this working for me or is there a reason for me to take the armor instead or what?

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 Well, if you have any symptoms of hypothyroidism remaining, then that would mean that your liver isn't activating the T4.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 Well, when they do the blood test and they say that my thyroid is at a normal level, that's...

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 Well, they changed the normal level previous to the use of pure thyroxine. There was a very slight difference like a 4 to 1 or 10 to 1 ratio of thyroxine to T3 in the blood, but now they consider 50 to 1 to be normal.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 So, you're saying that the blood test isn't reliable for me to know?

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 The blood test has been standardized on a population of people who have been using only thyroxine rather than the natural thyroid or people who have no thyroid problem at all.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 Well, now if I took the armor that has the T3 also, does that mean that I'm going to get, you know, make better use of it or I'm just going to be...

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 It's exactly the proportion that your own gland secretes and then the liver, if your liver is responding to the active T3 secreted by the gland, the liver will go ahead and convert the rest of the T4 to T3.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 But if you take armor thyroid and metabolize it perfectly, your blood test is going to show excess above normal T3 because they've standardized the test to say that normal is what is produced by taking thyroxine.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 Well, if it's going to help me, I might try it. How long does it take to take it before the test will show differently?

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 Well, if your TSH is in the low normal range and if your temperature and pulse rate are good and if you don't have any symptoms, then you're handling it properly.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 What are the symptoms of having a low thyroid?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 Cold hands and feet are very common, low blood sugar, anxiety, fatigue, depression, dry skin, edema, inability to go very long without getting hungry, craving sweets.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 I don't think I have too much of that. What happened is I had had atrial fibrillation and they discovered that I had a high thyroid or overactive thyroid, which I'd never had before.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 I don't know what caused it. It came on and the only symptom I had was the heartbeat, irregular heartbeat.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 So they told me basically I could take something called methimazole, which would lower the thyroid, but it would make me very susceptible to bad infections and lots of difficult side effects.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 The other thing they said I could do was have my thyroid, basically most of it destroyed by taking a radioactive iodine treatment.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 That sounds drastic, but it seemed like, well, if I shrink my thyroid down below normal with this, then that's it and all I have to do is take thyroid and that's not going to have the side effects of the methimazole.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 So I chose to do that and then gradually the thyroid started to shrink and it seems to have stabilized where I need to add the 88 micrograms and then I'm okay.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 What do you think about doing that if you have a hyperthyroid?

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 There was a study of people with hyperthyroidism treated by three different kinds of doctors.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 One did surgery, one did the radioactive iodine to kill the thyroid, and the third group got just the thyroid suppressing chemical.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 The patients on the chemical, most of them after six months recovered and the portion, about 30 percent, that didn't recover in six months, with another six months, they recovered just with the suppressing chemical.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Then they went on to have a functioning thyroid afterwards rather than having it destroyed.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 Well, for me, I already had it, but it didn't totally destroy it. They calibrated it so that it would just be a little bit below normal and I would still make some thyroid, but I'd have to have it add some.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 I just didn't want to take the chance on the chemical because there were so many side effects.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 Whereas once you lower it with the radioactive thing, then that's done.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 You're no longer radioactive. They say it goes straight through the thyroid gland and shrinks it and it doesn't go anywhere else in your body.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 So that's what's going on, so now I have to add the thyroid.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 So you're saying that if I don't have symptoms of hypothyroidism, then I should just stick with what I'm doing and I don't need the armor?

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 Yeah, the temperature, pulse rate, and symptoms are good indicators.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 Yeah, I don't have cold hands and feet. I think everything's normal.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 Sometimes I get fatigued, but I think it might be a result of going through the intense heart thing because it took a while for that to get balanced.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 But now everything seems to be getting better.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 Well, thank you. I want to give somebody else a chance. Thank you very much.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 Okay, bye.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 Thank you, beautiful.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 All right, we do have a couple of other callers, obviously, so let's take the next caller.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 You're on the air?

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 Yes, this is David from Missouri.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 Hi, David.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 Dr. Peat, I wanted to ask about what I'm starting to gather from reading most of your nutritional philosophy and then also looking at the East-West Healing Cookbook that you wrote the foreword for.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 I've noticed that on a lot of the food preparation that they will take the seeds out of, like, cucumbers and tomatoes and, you know, you always skin the potatoes.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 And I think I understand why, but I just wanted to understand this a little bit better.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 I know that we don't want seeds because they have polyunsaturated fats, but you would think that a lot of those seeds would just pass through.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 Is it because a lot of these things will lodge in the crooks and crannies of the intestine and possibly just sit there and become an irritant, or possibly the bacteria will feed off of that because it's --

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 You know, some seeds do pass through harmlessly, like cactus pear seeds. They're so tough that they pass through without being an irritant.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 Tomato seeds are so tender that if they get crushed by chewing, they release fairly toxic materials, protein oxidizing.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 And seeds in general are protected for the plant's benefit by toxins that are aimed at whatever predator threatens them.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 So many seeds contain toxins that are intended to prevent mammalian enzymes from digesting them.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 Ah-ha. So like a blackberry seed, you know, blackberries, I mean, they seem so good, but those seeds, they seem like they're just going to get stuck in the intestine somewhere.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 You know, they're so hard. Is that a possibility? Are those going to pass through, or are they going to create that toxic effect?

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 They pass right through unless you chew them and have an allergic reaction.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 Okay. And so like the potato skin, obviously that is not digestible, so that's going to probably sit in the intestine and feed bacteria, or is that going to pass through too?

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 No. Cellulose is a very harmless fiber because bacteria generally can't break it down.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 Only a few types of bacteria can attack cellulose, so it passes through just as bulky fiber.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 But the potato family, like the tomatoes, the whole family includes chemicals that are highly allergenic.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 So if you're allergic to tomatoes, you're likely to have some reaction to chilies, eggplants, and potatoes too.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 So you're saying just the whole potato in general or the skin itself?

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 The skin has the most allergens.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.000
 Okay, so it is a good idea to peel that then, more than likely.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 Yeah.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 Okay. And then the other thing is, you know, I've noticed that you recommend, it seems like you don't say for sure on this,

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 but you usually will say just plain white sugar rather than like if you're on the health food store now,

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:53.000
 they're always promoting these cane organic sugars that aren't refined, so they're not white.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 They're like branished colored and different things.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 I guess the problem with these things that are not more purified is that they have allergens in them

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 or possibly things from the processing of the different substances.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 Is that --

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 Yeah, if you've ever tasted blackstrap molasses, sometimes you can taste smoke in it.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 And they used to burn the cane fields to make them easier to harvest, and so they would be smoky.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 And then they would boil it down, and the molasses would collect minerals, a lot of nutritious stuff,

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 but also the junk and smoky material.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 Wow.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 And even with very clean material like maple syrup or the maguey juice, those come out very clean,

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 and when they're cooked, the high temperature, if it's browning the sugar, that's breaking down the sugar itself

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 and producing some highly irritating, possibly toxic materials.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 So if these different sugars were produced properly, they would be great,

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 but we're kind of playing it safe by just getting white sugar because it's probably the purest form of glucose and fructose, right?

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 Yeah, if it could, for example, be concentrated in a vacuum with a moderate temperature,

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 maybe something like pasteurization temperature,

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 that would be a very safe way to make sugar without having to wash the brown stuff out of it.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000
 So you could --

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 And so like the fructose that you can buy, like, in the health food stores,

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 you had mentioned to me in an email one time that, you know,

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000
 you've just got to make sure that you don't have a reaction to it.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 I guess what you were indicating there is that how they produce it again is potentially a problem.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
 Is that correct?

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 Yeah, I think it's all made from cornstarch industrially, and you have to just test it yourself.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 Some people have a fairly intense, quick reaction, allergic to it.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 Some people do beautifully on it,

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:29.000
 and I'm not sure if it's the person's difference or the product's difference.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:35.000
 And if you did find a fructose that worked best for you, or if it worked and you didn't have an allergic reaction,

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 that would be the ideal sugar, right?

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 Yeah, but fruit is really ideal because you get so many other nutrients with the sugar.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 And, you know, just one more question.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 Since you brought up fruit, like eating grapes that are seedless grapes,

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 is that skin a problem on a grape?

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 Is it going to stick in the intestine and then feed bacteria, or is it usually broken down pretty quickly?

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 One problem with grapes, if you don't wash them very carefully, is that the white bloom on the skin,

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 if you rub it and polish it, that comes off.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 It's because yeast grow on the waxy surface of the skin.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:28.000
 I've wondered about that, because you can almost see it.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:42.000
 Yeah, and so the fungus growing on the skin always has its normal amount of estrogen in it, which could be a drawback.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 So even if you just chewed it really, really well, it probably still wouldn't help in that aspect with it.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 Well, yeah, but a moderate amount of grapes, I don't think that amount of irritation is going to worry most people.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 Okay, well, thank you.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
 Thank you, if you'll call.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 Okay.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 Okay, we do have -- we've got two or three more people, but we're definitely going to have time for one more.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 And depending on how quick the caller is, their question or their question is, then we might get to some more.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 But let's take the next caller.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 A very quick addendum to the last call is, does cooking deactivate the enzymes in tomato seeds?

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
 And then we'll get to our next caller.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 Yes, it deactivates the enzymes, but it doesn't destroy the allergens.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
 Okay, next caller.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
 You're on the air.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 Oh, hello.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 Hi.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 I'm Yvonne from McKinleyville.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 Okay, thank you for calling.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 And I wanted -- one of my questions was already answered regarding his position on sugar, so we can skip that one.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 Okay.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 And I wondered what his position on salt and fats is.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 Dr. Peat.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000
 Each one.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 Salt and fats?

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 Salt and fats.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
 What kind of fat?

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 Salt.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 Yeah, what kind of fat were you asking about?

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 At the beginning of the program, you said something about his positions on sugar, salt, and fats.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 Okay, so --

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000
 I can't remember what you said about fats.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 We were talking in relation to saturated and polyunsaturated.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 Dr. Peat is very much a pro-advocate of saturated fats.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 Okay.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 And he's very much behind using salt and getting adequate salt in your diet as a --

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000
 And does he talk about what kind of salt?

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
 Well, I know, Dr. Peat, you want to answer?

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 Yes, clean white salt, like sea salt without additives is good.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 Yeah, okay.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 All right.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 That's the end of me, so maybe somebody else can have a turn.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 All right.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 Thank you.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 We do have one more caller, and if the caller wants to keep it short, we should be able to squeeze you in.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 Go ahead.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000
 Hi, I'm calling from Will Gulch, far west of --

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 I have a question, but I also want to say to the other callers that what's been recognized about Alzheimer's

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 is that it can come with iron deposits in the brain,

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:05.000
 and this traditional herb from India, turmeric, has been recognized as being able to chelate that iron.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 Like you have curcuminoid receptors throughout your body, curcumin, the active chemical component of turmeric,

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 so you can consume turmeric to help with Alzheimer's.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 It will help remove the excess iron deposits, and above that, it also helps rebuild the collagen

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 and removes the other deposits from your joints, too, so it helps with arthritis.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 And as for the toe fungus, neem is the traditional medicine to use.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 Neem oil you can use topically.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
 Neem you can take internally.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 Also, potentially activated charcoal, because it's likely that a dude has, like, a bacterial problem in his body,

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 and you could consume the activated charcoal, but you can use the neem oil directly on the fungus also.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 And to facilitate the liver, you can consume dandelion root.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000
 It's an excellent liver tonic.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 Dr. Peat, what do you think about the iron deposits?

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 I know you've always mentioned iron in a very dangerous reactive element.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:11.000
 Yeah, that fits right into what we've been talking about, the stress hormones that lead to Alzheimer's disease.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 Iron is sort of the end point of all of these changes.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:25.000
 Nitric oxide and prostaglandins activate enzymes which release and deposit iron in the brain,

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:31.000
 where it then continues amplifying the destructive reactions.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 I love the functionality of it.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 Okay, I'm afraid it is almost 8 o'clock.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 So I want to make sure that I give out Dr. Peat's contact details for people who want to find out more about him.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000
 And we'll just spend this last couple of minutes thanking Dr. Peat for his time.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 Thank you so much for joining us, Dr. Peat.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000
 Thank you.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 So, okay, the web address of Dr. Peat is www.raypeat.com.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 He has lots of articles that he's published and all fully referenced scientific journal articles, if you like.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000
 So go to his website.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 He's got a big resource there for information, not just on tonight's topic,

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:20.000
 but lots of information on thyroid, hormones, good fats versus bad fats, salt, sugar, etc.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000
 So until the third Friday of next month, my name is Andrew Murray.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:31.000
 We can be contacted on 1-888-WBM-HERB for any questions Monday through Friday.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.000
 Next month will be in September, folks, and heading towards the fall.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
 I hope the weather is going to be good where you are.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 Okay, until next month.
