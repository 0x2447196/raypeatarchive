00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.500
 My name is Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.000
 And for those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8pm,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts, which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 or which are sourced from other certified organic suppliers.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMU DeGarboville, 91.1 FM,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.500
 and from about 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're all invited to call in with any questions,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 The number here, if you live in the area, is 923 3911, or if you live outside the area,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 the toll-free number is 1800 568 3723, that's KMUD Rad.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 We can also be reached toll-free on 1888 WBM Herb for further questions during normal business hours Monday through Friday.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 So, this month we're again very pleased and fortunate to welcome Dr. Ray Peat back to this show,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 and we will be examining further some common misconceptions surrounding thyroid treatment,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 and the apparently normal thyroid test in clients with obvious manifestations of thyroid imbalance.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 We have ourselves seen remarkable progress made with clients with many and varied symptoms that improve dramatically,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 with diet and lifestyle changes that promote thyroid health, revealing a prior lowered thyroid function,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 even in the absence of diagnostic tests that show no obvious problems.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 So, welcome again to this month's show, Dr. Peat.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Hello, thank you.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 It's very kind of you to join us again.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Okay.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Oh, I think we should, Dr. Peat has over 40 years experience.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 I want to introduce Dr. Peat's experience for those of you who haven't heard Dr. Peat on our radio show last year.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 But he has over 40 years experience in lecturing, teaching, writing, editing, and nutritional counseling.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 So, we're very happy to have him join our show tonight.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 And he also has a PhD in biochemistry, and he also teaches on physiology, and basically functions as an endocrinologist.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Does that sound right, Dr. Peat?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Yeah, my PhD is in biology, but my work was all in physiology and biochemistry.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 So, we wanted to talk about thyroid disease because it seems to be such a chronic epidemic.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 And we thought we'd just start by introducing what thyroid disease is,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 in case there are listeners that are not aware of what their thyroid is or where it's located.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 So, Dr. Peat, what would you describe low thyroid disease to be or hypothyroidism?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 It's basically a slowing of the oxidative metabolism.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 And that means your biological efficiency falls drastically because we rely almost entirely on oxidative metabolism.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 In emergencies, we can use glycolytic non-oxidative metabolism,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 but then we have to make up for it by re-oxidizing the lactic acid that was produced in the oxygen deprivation or energy over-stressing.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 And so everything that is human or mammalian or even a complex organism depends on the thyroid

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 because all cellular activity to be efficient requires oxidative metabolism.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 So, thyroid in a sense is controlling the oxygen to all the cells in our system. Is that correct?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 And so one of the effects is that our carbon dioxide production is kept at a fairly high rate in relation to oxygen consumption.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 That keeps our tendency to produce lactic acid very low.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 So, if a person is low thyroid, even at rest, they can seem metabolically as if they're doing stressful activity.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 They can chronically have elevated lactic acid.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 And is this something that involves like chronic fatigue?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 People's muscles are chronically fatigued even though they're not really even doing any exercises

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 that might seem to be using their muscles besides just walking around?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Yes, because when you don't use oxygen efficiently, you have to make lactic acid to keep the cells alive.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 And the lactic acid then has to be reoxidized in your liver to turn it eventually to carbon dioxide.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 And so just sitting passively for a hypothyroid person can be the same as running at high speed for a healthy person.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 And about 60 years ago, it was very well known that a hypothyroid person has trouble relaxing their muscles and nerves.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 And so there were publications showing that you can just about invariably diagnose hypothyroidism

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 with a simple thump of the ankle tendon to the gastrocnemius muscle.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Which is the calf muscle.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Yeah.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 And when you're kneeling and you thump that, you can see that the relaxation is delayed.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 That was very well established as a good diagnostic method in the 1930s and '40s.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 But the labs and pharmaceutical companies couldn't sell anything.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 You can use just a table knife or a wooden hammer handle or anything to thump the tendon.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 And it just takes about two minutes to do it.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 And so it's a very uneconomical business for doctors in the pharmaceutical industry to be able to diagnose the condition so simply.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 So is this why the blood test came about that tests the TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Yeah.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 For the first 20 years or so, doctors were told not to use the Achilles relaxation test or the basal metabolic oxygen consumption test

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 or any of the proven absolute confirmations of hypothyroidism.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Because they had what they called the scientific blood test to prove it.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 And that was called the protein bound iodine test.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 And that convinced doctors all over the country that where previously 40% of the population had shown some evidence of being hypothyroid.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 The new blood test showed that only 5% were hypothyroid.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 So for 20 years, this test was used convincing the whole medical world that very few people are seriously hypothyroid.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 And then in the 1960s, it turned out that protein bound iodine has essentially nothing to do with thyroid hormone functioning.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 And what about the TSH that's used today?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Do you think that's relevant?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Yeah. When the protein bound iodine test was thrown out, they looked for other tests which conveniently proved to be even more expensive than the protein bound iodine.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 And that finally has settled in on the TSH test as the favored one.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 And they can measure it very precisely, but it just isn't clear what it means in many cases.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Because other things can raise it or lower it other than the absence or excess of thyroid hormone.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 So if someone is low thyroid or is not low thyroid, they can have varying levels of this TSH,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 which the doctors are saying is thyroid stimulating hormone, but which you're suggesting and other scientists are suggesting doesn't really relate specifically to thyroid.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 That's true. And it has some bad side effects.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 It promotes inflammation in itself.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 So low thyroid people not only lack the metabolic energy, but they tend very often to have very high TSH levels.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 And the TSH is causing some tissue damage chronically.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 Wow. Okay. So what do you think is causing low thyroid function in a lot of people in the US today?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 I think, well, 70 years ago, it sometimes included an iodine deficiency, but with the iodination of table salt, other factors became far more important.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 I've only seen the iodine deficiency condition a few times in people from South America or the mountains of Mexico.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 And many times it's a protein deficiency or an excess of eating certain foods that inhibit the thyroid, such as raw cabbage or even an excess of any of the cabbage family foods.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 So that would include kale, broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 And mustard and watercress. And even if they're cooked, if you eat a huge amount of them, that sometimes can be enough to make you hypothyroid.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Is this anything to do with the sulfur groups?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 Yeah, it's a combination of a carbon that contains an oxygen or nitrogen and the sulfur group.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 Okay. And so there are known medical chemicals that are used to specifically inhibit the thyroid to treat hyperthyroidism.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Okay. Right. I know in the previous interviews that we've done that you've very much brought out the polyunsaturated oils

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 as being definite antagonists to thyroid function and in fact downright thyroid destructive in some ways.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 Yeah, they antagonize the thyroid function at several levels.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 For example, they inhibit the proteolytic enzyme in the gland itself, which are needed to secrete, to form and secrete the hormone.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 And they bind to the protein in the bloodstream that transports thyroid, preventing the transport to the tissues.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 And they block several of the active sites in the cell, the points at which thyroid should bind to enliven the cell, the polyunsaturated fats.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 So they're affecting thyroid health at the production location, the thyroid gland, the transportation through the bloodstream,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 as well as at the tissue level where the tissues and the cells can pick up the thyroid hormone.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 Yes. And they act on several other parts of the system, including indirectly on the TSH and every other part of the metabolic system.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 So these polyunsaturated fatty acids are found in very high levels, are mainly consisting of vegetable oils, corn oil, soy oil,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 sesame seed oil, safflower, canola, rapeseed, and canola are the same, and fish, hemp, and flaxseed oils.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 So a lot of these oils that are purported to be good for our health are actually quite thyroid toxic and long-term use

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 could lead to conditions that are common in low thyroid and is as detrimental as cancer.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Yeah. And there's one which isn't really a fatty acid, but it's a highly unsaturated molecule, carotene, which is the precursor to vitamin A.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 It not only blocks the cellular sites that use vitamin A, but as a polyunsaturated molecule,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 it also blocks the thyroid function every place that the vegetable oils do.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 So this would be just basically ingesting lots of cooked carrots, that would be the...

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Yeah.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 And cooked pumpkin, anything that had high levels of carotene.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Okay, and that's that yellow pigment or the orange pigment.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Yeah, some of the studies confused people because they knew that vitamin A was protective against cancer,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 but they saw that some types of cancer increased with supplementation of carotene.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 Okay.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Right, so it's that the carotene blocks the receptor, so your body can't use the vitamin A that's in your diet.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 And so it sits in the receptor, but it doesn't stimulate our receptor.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 It sits somewhere in the cell that doesn't stimulate the effects of vitamin A,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 the protective cancer-protecting effects of vitamin A.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 And vitamin A and thyroid work so closely together biologically

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 that the protein that transports them is a single protein.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 It's called transthyretin for retinol and thyroid transport.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 And in the 1930s, one of the ways of confirming that a person had died from hypothyroidism

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 was that the steroid-forming tissues turned red because of the accumulated carotene.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 Because you can't use vitamin A if you don't have thyroid.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 And so the carotene accumulates in the steroid-forming tissue and makes them red.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 Would this be any reason now behind the basis of people with yellow calluses being very apparent on their soles or their palms?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 Yeah, that's one of the old ways to diagnose hypothyroidism.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Okay.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 Well.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 I think you've told us that before, Dr. Peat.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 We're going to pause here for a moment.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 Okay.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Well, you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMUD Garboville, 91.1 FM,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's topic of thyroid disorder.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 And we can hopefully cover iron and a few other subjects.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 But again, this month, we're very pleased and fortunate to welcome Dr. Raymond Peat back to the show.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 And we're going to be continuing to examine some common misconceptions surrounding thyroid treatment.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Okay.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 So, Sarah, did you want to carry on with?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Yeah.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 I printed out a long list of symptoms that are common in low thyroid disease.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 So we've been talking about low thyroid disease, which is known as hypothyroidism.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 And we've talked about what it is, what causes it.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 But I want to mention some symptoms and signs that accompany the disease

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 because so many people seem to be suffering from these symptoms.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Okay.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 Well, the list is pretty exhaustive.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 It may seem a little extreme, but pretty much all of these will be apparent in some people.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 So things like the obvious ones are less stamina than others,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 given that the metabolic rate helps us produce energy and gives us life.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 Less energy than others.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 A long recovery period after any activity.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 There's also the inability to fight infection, sort of low-grade chronic infections.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 Cold hands and feet are very kind of symptomatic of low thyroid.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 And then high, usually high or rising cholesterol in low thyroid patients does seem to be fairly common.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 And then things like dry hair, dry skin, hair loss, dry cracking skin.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Also, though, the other thing that seems to be contrary to dry skin is that you can have acne on the face,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 the shoulders, the chest and the back.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 So why would symptoms such as dry skin and dry hair and acne and oily skin both be symptoms of low thyroid?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Partly it's the close connection between vitamin A and thyroid.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 The skin needs vitamin A to differentiate properly.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 And mucous membranes require vitamin A, too,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 so that in an extreme deficiency, the surface of the eye becomes scaly and like snake skin.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 But the lack of both thyroid and vitamin A can cause lots of skin problems,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 including plugging the pores and allowing infection to set in because the thyroid doesn't allow the immune cells to function properly.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 And thinning of the skin just because it isn't growing fast enough.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Estrogen is contrary to vitamin A's effect.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 Progesterone and vitamin A are closely connected so that when you have enough vitamin A and thyroid,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 even your skin can produce progesterone and other steroids.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 And when they're lacking, then estrogen takes effect,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 and it tends to prematurely harden or keratinize the skin cells.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 They're called keratinized because they become horny.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 The juicy cell collapses and becomes just a bit of leathery scale-like material like makes up horn or hair.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 Wow.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 That's accelerated by estrogen and retarded,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 and the cells are allowed to stay vital and moist longer when there's enough thyroid, vitamin A and progesterone.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 All those good things.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 Sandra, do you want to carry on with--

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Okay, well, I don't want to bore people with too many different--

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 I know, but there's quite a lot of things here that I think people--

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 Yeah, okay, so things like exhaustion, and we mentioned that in the very beginning.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 Physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion, inability to work full-time or work hard

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 or feel that other people just seem to have that more go than you do and not understanding that.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Lack of motivation, lack of concentration, broken or peeling fingernails.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 We've mentioned dry skin.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 Tinnitus, ringing in the ears, another fairly common symptom.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 Things like joint pain.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 Fluid retention, almost to the point of congestive heart failure.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 Swollen legs that make it difficult to walk or painful.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 Blood pressure problems seem to be fairly frequent amongst low thyroid people, as do varicose veins.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 That's something that many doctors are completely confused about,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 which is hypothyroidism typically increases the viscosity of the blood and raises the blood pressure

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 so that a slightly hypothyroid person might have low blood pressure,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 but a very high percentage of the people with hypertension are simply hypothyroid,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 and correcting it with a supplement of thyroid, even the point of making them hyperthyroid,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 will lower the blood pressure.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 It just seems so counterintuitive to what most people would understand as being hyperthyroid.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Well, it's contrary to what we were taught in medical school.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 We were taught high blood pressure is a sign of high thyroid function.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 Low blood pressure is a sign of low thyroid function.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 So to hear the opposite and to see that in our own clients is astounding.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 That when they take a thyroid supplement, their blood pressure comes down.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 And you would think before this came about,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 that you think that normally your imagination of thyroid is a stimulating hormone,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 when actually it really improves your sleep and calms you down

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 and lowers your blood pressure and lowers your resting pulse,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 from a point of maybe 90 or more of an adrenaline high pulse, it brings it down.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 I've seen two people who chronically had a pulse around 180 beats per minute.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 And one of them had it like that for about 20 years.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 And both of them, within a couple of weeks of taking thyroid,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 had it down to a normal 90 or 100 beats.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 Wow. I wonder what they thought.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 So that's another thing, is a racing pulse.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 What do you consider to be a healthy, normal thyroid pulse?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 And what do you consider to be a low thyroid pulse?

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 What are those ranges?

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 Because of course in medical school we were taught 70 to 80 beats per minute is normal.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 If you're higher than 80 beats per minute, you could have a disease.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 So what is your opinion on this, Dr. Peat?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 There have been several studies of people of different ages, for example, high school kids.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 And the ones who were healthy and got the best grades and had the best attention

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 had a resting pulse of averaging 85 beats per minute.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 And when old people on heart pacemakers were given mental exams

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 with the pacemaker set at the usual 70 beats,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 they had the usual old person's memory and reasoning ability.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 When they cranked the pacemaker up to 85 per minute, every mental function improved.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 So there you go. Cool.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 So that's pretty interesting because that's, again, we're taught that high thyroid,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 excess thyroid, hyperthyroid is diagnosed by a racing pulse.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 There is an old doctrine that around the beginning of the 20th century,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 they called it the rate of living theory, that the faster your heart beat, the sooner you would die.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 And the experiment that defined that and proved it for so many people

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 was to put some cantaloupe seeds in a dish in a saucer of water

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 and watch them sprout.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 The ones that sprouted the soonest and grew the fastest died soonest,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 but they didn't put any soil.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 So they used up all their food.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 And that's what they were using to support that rate of living theory?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 Yeah. It's just an embarrassment for science.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 It's like if you gave a person all the thyroid they needed but no food,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 they would die quickly.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 They'd get skinny.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 I think Dr. Peate, there's a couple of callers on the line, so let's take the first caller.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 Okay, you're on the air.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 Hello.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 Hello, is it me?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Yes, you're on the air.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 There was no sound. Hi, thank you all. I have a couple of related questions.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 Okay, go ahead.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 If a person was quite low in thyroid and it wasn't known for a long time, like more than 20 years,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 I wonder what kind of damages that could cause.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 About 12 minutes in, Dr. Peate talked about tissue damage,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 and maybe you could tell me what he meant more by that.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 And then once taking supplementation, when could you expect to be much better?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 I have been getting supplements for 20 years after not having any,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 and I'm still quite incapacitated.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 Oh, usually doctors prescribe thyroxine because that isn't the thyroid hormone.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 It has to be turned into the active thyroid hormone,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 which is called triiodothyronine or T3 in the liver to be active,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 and the thyroid gland secretes a little.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 But when a doctor prescribes thyroxine, there's no chance that you'll be overdosed

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 because as you increase it, one of the first patients I heard about who had a myxedema coma

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 became totally unresponsive from hypothyroidism.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 She had been mildly hypothyroid for years, and they prescribed 100 micrograms of Synthroid,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 and she became more hypothyroid, and they doubled it.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 And when they reached 500 micrograms, she went into a coma.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 What about--oh, sorry.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 That was supplementing more and more thyroxine.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 But when in the hospital they gave her an injection of the active hormone T3,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 she came out of the coma in just a few hours and was completely well after that.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 You can have a complete, just amazing recovery from many things in just a matter of minutes in some cases.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 For example, a doctor who had been having agonizing breast pain,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 especially premenstrually for increasing over the recent years, I visited,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 and she said that that was her main problem.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 I gave her a 10-microgram tablet of Thymel.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 She went in to--said she would see me in an hour when she finished with the patient.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 In 10 minutes, she came out saying, "I can't believe that. It stopped."

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 And that's a very typical thing in less than an hour with just T3.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 Pain such as menstrual or breast pain will stop totally.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 I have taken both of those, and also now I have the, like, armor.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 It's not synthetic.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 So you're saying that no matter how much damage over, like, a couple of decades, all of that could be repaired.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 Yes, some types of damage such as osteoporosis.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 When your thyroid is very low, your--one compensation is that your pituitary tends to swell up

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 and overproduce prolactin, and that's one of the factors in causing breast pain

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 and disturbed salt regulation and so on.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 But prolactin is a major factor in causing loss of bone.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 And as at menopause, very often prolactin goes up because thyroid has gone down,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 and the prolactin coincides with extreme loss of bone.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 And so it takes sometimes a long time of correcting your diet along with thyroid before you restore your bones.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 But I have seen a couple of people--one had her X-ray bone exam showing tremendous--

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 I think it was 20% increase in less than a year when she was taking thyroid.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 Okay, I'm going to go so other people can speak to you, but I don't have a thyroid,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 so I don't know if that makes a--you know, if that makes much more of a difference.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 I'm wondering if the question you're wanting to ask is what would happen to someone's body?

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 How much damage is there?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 That's what I was asking because for 20 years--the doctor removed my thyroid,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 but they never did anything about checking back, so I went for more than 20 years.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 Without taking any supplementation at all after a thyroid is removed.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 So what would you--I mean, do you think there's damage that's been done in this client, Dr. Reed, that's irreparable?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 It just increases your stress and slows your recovery from stress,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 and so it tends to age you faster than usual, just like working too hard would.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 But those changes--for example, bone growth.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 I grew an inch and a half in my 40s when I started taking thyroid.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Wow.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 So it happened over just a period of a few months,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 and so even lifelong things can be corrected pretty quickly.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 Thanks again. Bye.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 Very good.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 Okay, well, let's see if we have any other callers on the line.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 I think there's one or two at least.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 Okay, you're on the air?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 Yes, I am.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 Okay, go ahead.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 Hi. I wanted to ask two questions, and I'll take my answer on the air.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Okay.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 What is--first of all, let me say, I've had--I was thyroid toxic--in storm.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 Thyrotoxicosis?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 Yeah, thyrotoxicosis.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 Okay.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 Went into storm for four months, was treated with I-131,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 and for the last 30 years, I've been taking Synthroid.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 Okay?

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Okay.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 Now, here's my question.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Could the doctor please explain the connection between the adrenals,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 the--in the brain, the pituitary, and the thyroid gland?

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 It seems to be a miracle round that goes around and around and back and forth.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 Okay, can you possibly turn your radio down if you haven't already,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 because we seem to be getting some feedback interference,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 and we can barely hear your question.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 My radio's not on.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 Okay.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 It's on, okay.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 All right.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 It's breaking up.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 Okay, I think I heard your question.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 You said basically you had thyroid toxicosis, you were treated with Iodine-131,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 and then you were given a thyroid replacement?

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 Right.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Okay, and your main question was?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 What is the connection between the adrenals and the stress factor,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 the pituitary and the thyroid?

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 How do they communicate with each other, and just how bad is the stress?

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 Okay, there you go.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 Dr. Peat, did you hear that question?

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 I think most of it.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 When your thyroid is low, because you don't have the efficiency with oxidative metabolism,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 you turn a lot of your sugar into lactic acid,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 and then your liver spends more energy converting the lactic acid back into sugar.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 So low blood sugar is constantly a problem in hypothyroidism.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 And the compensation for that is that first your adrenal medulla secretes a lot of adrenaline

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 to force your liver to give up any sugar it has stored.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 And when that doesn't meet your needs for sugar,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 then the adrenal cortex begins over-secreting cortisol to break down protein or muscle tissue

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 to make sugar out of it to keep your energy up.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 And the falling blood sugar itself and the rising adrenaline,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 both of those are signals to your brain to increase the stress hormones.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 The ACTH is produced by the pituitary gland,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 but also other brain and pituitary hormones including prolactin increase along with it.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 And the ACTH is what drives your cortisol up,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 and the cortisol is what causes the most acute tissue damage,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 loss of muscle mass and quick loss of bone structure and so on.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 It's also weight gain, isn't it?

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 This is low muscle mass in relation to weight and fat?

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 Yeah, as your ability to burn fat decreases with your falling thyroid,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 the cortisol eats up your skeletal muscles that burn fat,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 and so the unburned fat gets laid down in your trunk and neck and face area.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 It's probably some kind of a defensive reaction to pad your organs when you're under chronic stress.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 Right, because muscles burn a lot of energy,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 and so therefore muscular people can eat a fairly high calorie diet

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 because that energy is being consumed by the muscle,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 whereas people that have an excess of fat and a lack of muscle tone

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 can very easily get fat on a very small amount of calories.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 Is that right?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Yes.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Yeah, okay.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 Well, I don't know if that answered the...

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 I'm pretty sure it helped to answer the lady's question,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 if not answered it completely.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 A lot of people who have measured deficiency of adrenal function,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 that seems to be a medically popular diagnosis is adrenal fatigue or insufficiency,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 but to get any adrenal function you need the vitamins, vitamin A especially, and thyroid.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 So many people have been diagnosed as having Addison's disease

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 simply because their thyroid was so low that they couldn't produce steroids.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 The other factor for producing steroids is cholesterol,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 and so if you have both low cholesterol and low thyroid,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 then your adrenals aren't going to be able to make the steroids

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 such as progesterone and pregnenolone and cortisol.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 So really what some doctors would say,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 "Oh, you have adrenal fatigue and that would be maybe diagnosed by a saliva test."

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 Really what they need to be looking at is the thyroid function

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 and making sure those people are getting enough vitamin A

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 and that their cholesterol is high enough or they're getting enough in their diet.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 Yeah.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 Do we have any other corners?

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 We don't.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 Okay, so let's carry on with...

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 I wanted to say another thing that I believe this is what you think, Dr. Peat,

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 is the temperature and pulse can be a measurement of one sign of a low thyroid function.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 So how would you say a temperature is affected with someone who has a low thyroid?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 What would their waking morning temperature typically be in the range of?

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 Usually around 98 degrees oral temperature.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 And then after they eat, what would their temperature be?

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 It should pretty quickly pop right up to 98.6, 98.8,

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 and then as they get some muscle activity going during the day,

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 it can even rise above that 99 degrees is good in the afternoon.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 Okay, so this is a normal function.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 First thing in the morning, your temperature should be around 98.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 Okay, now I just want to say of all the clients that I've had take their temperatures and pulses,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 about two out of 50 have had--since I've been doing this temperature and pulse thing all of last year--

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 about 50 of them have had much lower temperatures than that

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 and only two have had what you just described, Dr. Peat.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 So can you say most of them, if they had low thyroid symptoms,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 in conjunction with those low temperatures would be a diagnosis of low thyroid?

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 Yeah, if you look at the whole picture, the Achilles reflex and their symptoms

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 and how many calories they can burn without getting fat and how well they sleep

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 and the activity efficiency to be able to relax instantly after the exertion

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 and to be able to go to sleep quickly, all of those go with the good temperature curve.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 So it's something that can be used in conjunction with symptoms.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 Right.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 I think we have a caller on the air.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 Yeah, we do. Go ahead, caller.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 Hi, this is Kevin.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 Hey, Kevin.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 Hi, Kevin.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 Andrew and Sarah, hi.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 So I had a question about Hashimoto's disease.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 I was diagnosed with that and understand that it interferes with the absorption of thyroid

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 and I'm wondering if Dr. Peat can speak about Hashimoto's

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 and what, if anything, can be done to alleviate it, cure it.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 The disease was originally defined as infiltration of white blood cells

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 into the inflamed thyroid gland and since they didn't necessarily like to cut out a piece of gland

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 to confirm that that's what was wrong, they started looking at antibodies in your blood

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 and assuming that you would have the infiltration and inflammation of the gland

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 if you find the antibodies circulating in the blood.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 But in fact, the antithyroid antibodies overlap with many other problems including arthritis

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 and so the antibodies aren't strictly clearly diagnostic,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 but they do indicate that something is inflamed

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 and since the thyroid is the basic anti-inflammatory hormone and organ,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 it's very often the thyroid that is the main problem when you have these antibodies

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 and there have been several studies in which simply supplementing even with thyroxine

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 for six months or a year, the antibodies will decrease and the whole problem is solved.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 One thing I've heard of also is taking low-dose naltrexone as a way of helping with the condition.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 Have you heard of that?

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 When you're hypothyroid and produce lactic acid too easily, you tend to accumulate endorphins.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 Endorphins are produced in response to the signal of increased lactic acid

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 to compensate for the stress by acting like morphine equivalents

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 and the endorphins themselves limit your physiological functions in a protective way,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 sort of like a localized kind of hibernation.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 So the naloxone or naltrexone will clear those out.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 Sometimes in two or three days, you can see a person come out of depression or a lethargic state

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 or there was a study in California of demented people

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 who were given very big doses of naloxone for several days or several weeks

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 and their dementia improved just by blocking the endorphins.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 How long that somebody should be on naltrexone with conditions like Hashimoto's?

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 Is there any problem with long-term use?

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 No, but I usually see good results in just two or three days.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 So I think the basic treatment is a good diet and thyroid supplement as needed

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 and then the naloxone or naltrexone is a good thing to try once in a while

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 and if it makes you feel better, then it probably was breaking up a pattern.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 Okay, thank you very much.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 Thank you for your call, Kevin.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 We have two other callers on the line.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 Go ahead. You're on the air?

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 Yes, thank you for taking my call.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 My name is Mike and I have a question for the doctor.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 Earlier I heard the show the doctor was listening a number of vegetables

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 and some polyunsaturated oils that had something to do with making something higher

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 and I'm assuming that had to do with the thyroid.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 My question is, would cod liver oil be placed in with those other oils?

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 And I'll take my question off the air. Thank you.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 The fish oils are long molecules compared to the seed oils

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 and they are also more unstable to oxidative breakdown

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 and the fact that they are long means that they don't inhibit our enzymes for metabolizing fats

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 as seriously as the seed oils such as canola or corn oil do.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 But their instability means that by the time they get in the blood,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 they're pretty well oxidized and several studies have shown that the fish oils

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 do have an anti-inflammatory effect but only their oxidative breakdown products

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 which include some serious toxins, only those are really active anti-inflammatory substances

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 and what they're doing is poisoning the immune system, suppressing immunity.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 So temporarily, it's effective for alleviating symptoms but in the long run,

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 it's not good because the breakdown products include things like acrolein

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 and several of the free radical oxidative damage fractions of the broken down fats.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 And those are both very dangerous toxic substances.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 So not only does it suppress your immune system, it also through this immune system suppression,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 it's also releasing toxic substances.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 And there are really quite a few articles that people don't get to hear about

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 showing that the fish oils contribute to atherosclerosis and increase the risk of metastatic cancer

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 and are toxic to the brain and so on.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 The commercial promotion of the fish oils, they happen to never mention those.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 Yeah. Well, I think we've got two other callers on the line, Dr. Peat.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 So let's take the next caller. You're on the air?

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 Hello?

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 Hello, you're on the air.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 Hi, my name is Jenny. Thank you for speaking, Dr. Peat.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 I've been on armor thyroid for some years now and they want to change over,

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 change me and put me on one of the synthetic thyroid.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 And I'm wondering if there are any disadvantages to doing that.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 And also I'm wondering about if the synthetic thyroid, I've heard they are made with milk products,

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 which I can't tolerate cow's milk. So I'm wondering about those two things.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 The company that makes armor also makes a synthetic called thyrolar,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 which was based on the original armor thyroid product.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 And the FDA has been requiring a lot of formula changes in the natural thyroid.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 So it seems to vary in quality according to the interference by the FDA.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 And the thyrolar as a synthetic, I think it has been pretty steady over the last 40 or 50 years,

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 since it is just a synthetic chemical. And it's very equivalent to the traditional armor.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 But you can find out on the armor company's website, Forest Pharmaceuticals, whether there's milk in it.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 Several other products contain the same synthetic chemicals.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 I get them from Mexico. One is called Novo Tyrol and the other one is Ceno Plus.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 And they're very similar to armor thyroid.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000
 So when you see your doctor, if you want to ask them to,

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 if you want to request that you have a prescription for thyrolar, that's spelled T-H-Y-R-O-L-A-R, thyrolar.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 Thank you. You're very welcome.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 Okay, I think we might just have time for one more caller before we need to wrap up here.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
 So you're on the air? Yes, I'm on the air. Okay.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 This is not related to thyroid.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 I actually wanted to ask you about something that has to do with tuberculosis and staph infections.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 Okay. I've had somebody at Red River Rural and also at Garberville Clinic, I've been diagnosed with staph.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 Okay. How do I treat this?

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 Okay, I mean, when you say you've been diagnosed with staph, do you have multiple lesions resembling small boils?

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 All over my body. Okay.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 Welts. Right.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 And it started a cat scratch, went up my nose, and then it went into my eyes, and it went all over my body.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 And then my husband caught it too.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 And they had to put a wick into his chest because he had staph.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 Wow. I don't mean to be personal, but is there any kind of drug abuse or any kind of very low immune status amongst either of you?

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 Immune status...

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 Do you normally get coughs and colds more frequently than other people or any kind of infections more easily than other people?

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000
 Do you have any kind of history of having a weak immune system?

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:36.000
 I'd say that I get a cold every once in a while because my stepson comes back from CR and he always gets a cold.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 Okay. All right. I think without going too far into it because we really don't have the time,

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 I would certainly come up with a few suggestions of things to try and then we'll throw it over to Dr. Peat

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 and see what Dr. Peat would be thinking about.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 I know there's one product and it's actually manufactured in England.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:59.000
 I don't know if you can get it in America, but basically it's an allicin-rich garlic extract.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 Now, Dr. Peat may not like this much, I don't know, because it does contain a lot of sulfur

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 and there's sulfhydryl groups that we were talking about to begin with that you find in the brassica family, the thyroid suppressive.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 So the allicin was used very successfully for staph, for internal staph.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000
 So that's basically one solution.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 Other immune stimulating herbs from an herbal perspective would certainly be useful to improve your tissues resistance

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 to the byproducts of the staph infection that cause that boil and that breakdown of that tissue.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 But Dr. Peat, I'm very interested to hear if you have any comments to make on staph infection, systemic staph infection.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 Well, I'll talk to you directly then.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 Go ahead and Dr. Peat will talk on the air now.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 I've seen a few cases of chronic infection, some that had gone on for decades,

00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 that cleared up with just thyroid or thyroid and nutrition.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:06.000
 And it's good to cover the bases.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 Even some antibiotics, tetracycline, for example, happens to have a structure that's parallel to vitamin K

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 and to the active ingredient of aloe and cascara.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 And so those three or four molecules have a very beneficial effect on your immune system

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 as well as being slightly suppressive to a variety of bacteria.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 Doctor, have you ever known somebody who has gone into the VA?

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 My husband is in the VA clinic and he's gone and we were worried about that.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:02.000
 I had a friend whose doctors insisted that they first were going to amputate his feet

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 and then they decided they would amputate his legs because they said the infection in the bones made it incurable.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 And since I had read Broda Barnes' book and had seen a couple of cases of chronic infections,

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:25.000
 clearing up myelitis and such, I made my old friend take thyroid for a while.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:32.000
 And the ulcers, he had gangrene into the bones of his feet.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 Within two weeks, the sores had closed and he was putting on his dress shoes and going to lodge.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 And we went through cycles.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 I think there were three cycles where his doctor made him stop the thyroid.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 The bone infection came back after two or three months and I would see his feet rotting,

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 make him take his thyroid and his feet each time cleared up totally.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 But the doctor finally said, "Well, there's still infection in there so we have to cut them off."

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000
 Okay, I'm going to have to call it a night there.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 Thank you very much for all of your calls.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 And Dr. Peat, thank you very much for joining us again on the show.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 Thank you all.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 I want to mention that Dr. Peat's website is very extensive, has lots of articles on it,

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 very much researched scientific information.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 So some of it may seem counter-controversial or counter to what we're told,

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 but it's scientific information that you can all check out.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 His website is www.rayPeat.org.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 And that's spelled R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 No, it's dot com now.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 Sorry, dot com, rayPeat.com.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 Okay, folks, so that's the website.
