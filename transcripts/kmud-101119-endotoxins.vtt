00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 My name's Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 which run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8 PM,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 We've run a clinic in Garverville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 To continue, the last two months, we've been talking about the role of good sugars and bad sugars.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Excuse me.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 And again this month, I'm very pleased to be joined by Dr. Ray Peat

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 who's going to expose the risk of endotoxin and dietary effects that influence endotoxin production.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 There's a lot of research now to show that endotoxin is associated with many inflammatory diseases

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 that you wouldn't normally associate with food.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 So, the adage "You are what you eat" is very true.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 And perhaps we should say that you suffer as a result of what you eat.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 So, we're excited to have Dr. Ray Peat with us again this month

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 and we'll be hearing from him on this scientific-based approach to endotoxin.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Now, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KNUD Garverville 91.1 FM

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's topic.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 So, Dr. Peat, are you with us?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Yes.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Hi. Thank you so much for joining.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 As always, new people can be listening who perhaps have never heard you before.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 So, would you please just give an outline of your expertise?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 I'm studying hormones and nutrition mostly.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 I got my PhD in physiology with a biochemical orientation concentrating on reproductive aging

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 and that was when I got interested in the interactions of estrogen, oxygen, unsaturated fatty acids

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 and the toxic interactions of some of our natural materials with environmental materials and processes.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Okay. So, to talk about this month, the role of endotoxin, would you just describe endotoxin?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Its chemical name is lipopolysaccharide and there are several kinds of bacteria that make similar things

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 but it's a combination of a starch-like molecule with some fatty acids attached to it

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 and it's so widely distributed that all animals have a system for reacting to it and defending themselves against it

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 and it seems to be partly a bacterial defense against the bacteria's environment

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 and so there's an evolved back and forth relationship between animals and the bacteria

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 and it's a matter of things getting out of balance that causes the endotoxin to be a problem.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Okay. So, I hear of many foods that promote this production.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 Would you be able to list some specific foods that people should be thinking about before they consume them

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 given that we're going to open up the negative effects of endotoxin?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Mostly, it seems to be things that are poorly digested that pass along with a lot of food value down into the intestine

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 where bacteria thrive on them.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Things like fruit are so quickly digested by most people.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 The liquid parts, minerals and sugars can be largely absorbed before you get down to the bacterial area of the intestine

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 and so the more indigestible the food is, the more risky it is for supporting an overgrowth of bacteria

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 and if your digestion happens to be poor, then more foods will pass along and become bacteria food.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Indigestible fibrous materials, types of starch that can't be broken down by animal enzymes or human enzymes

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 become good food for bacteria and many of these are being promoted for intestinal health to stimulate the peristalsis and so on.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 About 30 years ago, some Australian studies saw that people who ate a lot of oat bran

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 actually were increasing their risk for bowel cancer.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Certain types of fiber cause such intense growth of bacteria that the bacteria produce many types of toxins,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 not just the fragment of the bacterial coat that's known as endotoxin,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 but they can produce modified proteins, modified fats and so on from indigestible food.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 So endotoxin is just one kind of universal toxin that everyone has some basic defenses against it

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 while there are other types of toxins that are more specifically influenced by your diet.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 So when people say, "Oh, I can't have a normal bowel movement if I don't eat lots of fiber in my diet."

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 Well, there are some very safe fibers that come from plants that have their own defenses against bacteria and fungi.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 Raw carrots, for example, if you've noticed that many vegetables will spoil in the refrigerator

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 while carrots still seem to be completely clean and unattacked by bacteria or molds.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 That's because there are chemicals that are defensive for those plants.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 When we eat them, they remain like antibiotics all the way through our intestines,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 so they are very hard for bacteria to grow on.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 And in that way, they also provide a good roughage that doesn't get broken down by bacteria.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Yeah, and it can also bind some of the toxins produced by bacteria

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 so that rather than increasing the amount produced,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 it can actually bind it and carry it out, subtracting toxins.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 It's almost like the activated charcoal that's used for detoxifying ingested chemicals.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 Carrots are a natural way of doing that.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 And when people say, "Oh, if I eat a good green salad, then I have a wonderful bowel movement,"

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 is that because the bacteria are stimulating, actually stimulating the peristalsis

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 because we don't have cellulose-digesting enzymes

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 and it's actually relying on the bacteria to ferment and digest the cellulose?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Yeah, some people get terribly constipated when they eat raw vegetables.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Other people, it's enough irritation to stimulate the intestine.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 There are doctors for a long time who have warned against using stimulant laxatives,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 but when they recommend eating vegetables, it's really primarily a stimulant action

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 produced by irritating substances either in the vegetable itself or produced by the bacterial growth.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 If you've ever left a head of lettuce in a closed container at room temperature,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 you know how quickly lettuce can decompose compared to a carrot.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Lettuce is very good bacterial food, so it can become very toxic if you happen to catch the wrong bacteria.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 So the last couple of months we've spent time talking about the different types of sugars,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 the good sugars versus the bad sugars.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 I don't really like to use that good and bad description,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 but you've been describing, Dr. Peat, the health benefits of an easily digested sugar,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 one that gets digested in the stomach and very high up in the intestinal tract,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 thereby not providing any food for bacteria further down.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 These are mainly fruits and honey, soft, ripe, juicy fruits and honey,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 and even white sugar is pretty rapidly absorbed.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 And the lactose in milk is another good sugar.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 And lactose in milk.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 And those are all things that our human digestive tracts can absorb quickly and efficiently

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 without having to rely on bacterial degradation.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 They also have a defensive effect against the products of the bacteria,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 so that once you are poisoned by the endotoxin,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 the sugars protect by decreasing the inflammation reaction to them.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 So if you ate starches for dinner tonight, then tonight before bed,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 some good sugars will help protect against some of the endotoxin that could be produced by the bacteria

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 that are digesting the starches.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 So those are what we call the bad sugars, and they come from more resistant to digestion.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 The starches are more resistant to digestion and include the breads, the pastas, the cakes, the cookies,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 the flours, the grains, the beans, rice, those types of food products

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 that don't get immediately digested in the stomach

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 and then can be digested further on down by the bacteria.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Another kind of defensive food is the saturated fat.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 These are, if you think of soap and its antibacterial effect,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 the saturated fats are mildly antiseptic.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 So if you eat butter with your potato, the starch is less likely to become a toxic material for the bacteria

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 because the butter saturated fats will suppress bacterial growth.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 So that means mashed potatoes with lots of milk and butter can protect against eating these starches

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 that are a little more resistant to digestion.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 And cooking them well, if you cook your starches really, really well,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 like weren't you saying, Dr. Peat, if you boil potatoes for 45 minutes to an hour,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 that if they're softer, then they'll be digested more easily in your stomach.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 It's pretty basic when you think of it.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 You think of grains, they're quite resistant to digestion,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 and then you think of beautifully ripe papaya or mango,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 or right now we have nice soft persimmons in this part of the country.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Those are pretty easily digested.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 I was wondering, Dr. Peat, you don't actually sign up for the belief of the commensal organisms in the gut.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Is that right?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 As far as you understand it, there needn't be gut bacteria.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 When we were studying it, this is such a doctrine, the commensal organism kind of theory.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 Everyone's got commensal gut bacteria and you need them.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 Well, the experiments with germ-free animals,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 they do find they're actually healthier than the normal germ-infected animals

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 until if they grow up never exposed to bacteria, they seem very healthy,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 but then they've never developed their immune defenses,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 and so when they are exposed, they're extremely susceptible to infection.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 So if we're going to live in a world with germs, we might as well get used to them.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 When I was looking at some of the research on endotoxin,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 and when we were studying for the microbiology lectures,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 endotoxin was always something associated with E. coli or salmonella or typhoid.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 So far as our own normal, we'll say that they exist, but our own commensal, our own gut bacteria,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 then are in their own right able to be a reasonable threat to us in terms of toxin production

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 if when we eat these foods that you've mentioned are helpful for those bacteria to live on,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 then the endotoxin production by our own bacteria can be significant.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 Is that right?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 Yeah, all the bacteria produce something that can be sickness-inducing.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 The lactobacillus itself, even though it's unbalanced, probably favorable,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 the polysaccharide material in its covering can also produce inflammation

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 and a whole range of pathological reactions.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 So it's really a matter of balance.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 So the very cell wall of these bacteria can, in their own right, trigger inflammatory responses.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 Is that correct?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 Yeah.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 And so what about the research that's being done in cancer,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 in endotoxin in the formation of cancers because of that chronic inflammation that happens

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 with endotoxin being absorbed into the bloodstream and triggering those secondary effects?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 I think that's a very plausible approach.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 If you look at practically any degenerative disease, arthritis, gout, dementia, epilepsy, hepatitis,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 almost anything is crucially made worse by the endotoxin once you get stressed.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Then all of these things are exacerbated by the endotoxin.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Now, just describe the word "stress."

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 What do you mean when you say "stressed"?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 Just a mental stress, for example, that will shift the blood away from your digestive system,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 out to your legs and arms, the fight or flight reaction.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Right, so the adrenaline.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 Yeah.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 If that persists or is very intense, the intestine loses its barrier function

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 and bacteria can go right through the membrane,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 lightening the intestine into the bloodstream, even passing through the whole intestine out into the abdominal cavity.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 Before the whole bacteria goes through, a much lower degree of stress will begin letting the endotoxin flow in at an increased rate.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 So just thinking stressful thoughts will tend to increase your endotoxin absorption.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Right, I mean, it's very real.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 I think most people, when they hear that, stressful thoughts, they probably start chuckling, you know.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 But it's pretty straightforward.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 It's cause and effect, and what you're saying about stress is very real physiologically.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 So that's why I wanted to bring out the whole endotoxin thing

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 and the diets that promote endotoxin because of the bacteria feeding on,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 and what you can do to help yourself can be a really very simple way of improving your health.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 Like sitting down and having a relaxing meal instead of eating on the go.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 Yeah.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 And the things that you've done in the last several years contribute to how risky any little stress is.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 Okay.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 For example, women who were going to a fertility clinic,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 a doctor had a theory that maybe their ovaries were infected, the reason they weren't fertile.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 He put some of them on a moderate dose of penicillin or other antibiotic,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 and many of them noticed that their mood and headaches were relieved by the antibiotic.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 And that got the doctors interested in seeing what was happening to their hormones,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 and they also became pregnant.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 But they thought that before they took the antibiotic circulating in their blood,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 they had a stress level of cortisol and a very high ratio of estrogen to progesterone.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 And taking the antibiotic, their cortisol and estrogen decreased and the progesterone increased.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 And that turns out in that particular study, they didn't determine the mechanism,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 but they've also seen exactly the same pattern in studies with rats.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 And I've done the same measurements in women who had those syndromes, PMS and infertility,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 and just two or three days of eating a raw carrot salad every day,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 they had exactly that shift of hormones, increased progesterone, decreased estrogen and cortisol.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 And the other research shows that endotoxin alone will account for exactly those changes.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 You inject an animal with endotoxin and its estrogen, even a male animal,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 the estrogen will go up maybe five times higher than normal,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 and the progesterone and testosterone fall sharply.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 Okay. All right.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 Well, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMU Decalberville, 91.1 FM,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 You're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's topic of endotoxin

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 and its systemic effects and how you can help yourself.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 The number here is 923 3911, or if you're outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 So, Dr. Peat, in terms of endotoxin production and diet,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 because I know that you're very keen on the saturated fats and you've got lots of research

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 and there's plenty of information out there to show that the polyunsaturated fats are actually pretty bad for you.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 How about endotoxin and the PUFA, the polyunsaturated fatty acids?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 Is there any increased link between the two?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 Yeah, they do favor the growth of many microorganisms, but they also interact at every stage.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 For example, the permeability of the intestine is increased by the polyunsaturated fat.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 One of the first reactions when the cell senses the endotoxin is to produce nitric oxide.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Nitric oxide increases the permeability, leakiness of the intestine.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 And if your tissues happen to be well-supplied with polyunsaturated fats,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 the nitric oxide increases the release and amount of pre-fatty acids in circulation.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 And so the person who has eaten a lot of polyunsaturated fat, once a stress triggers the absorption of endotoxin,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 then the reaction can be much more intense.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 And those same things will trigger the release of serotonin and increase all of the inflammatory mediators.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 And the environment of increased estrogen, decreased progesterone, and testosterone will continue that like a cascade of bad effects.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 So just to describe for some of our listeners, estrogen, estrogen, estrogen,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 is a very inflammatory hormone that's involved in a lot of cancers.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 It is useful at that level when it's balanced with progesterone, which is an anti-aging hormone.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 It's a fertility hormone.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 So if you want to look at it, the estrogen is the bad guy, progesterone is a good guy,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 and these bacteria tend to increase the estrogen in relation to the progesterone.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 And then for the polyunsaturated fats, those consist of fats from mainly seeds, nuts and seeds,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 almond oil, sunflower oil, safflower, corn, soy, cotton seed, all those liquid oils except olive oil,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 which is not very polyunsaturated.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Olive oil is only 10% polyunsaturated.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 And the saturated fats are the ones that are antibacterial, so they're antimicrobial,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 and they will inhibit the bacterial growth in the intestine.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 And those include butter, coconut oil, palm oil, palm shortening, not the unrefined,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 and also some animal fats that are from animals that haven't been eating corn and soy, unless they are beef and lamb,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 that do eat corn and soy, they have four stomachs, they can process the fats into a saturated fat,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 whereas chicken fat and pig fat are going to be polyunsaturated because the chickens and the pigs are fed polyunsaturated grains and beans and corn and soy.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 So that's just to give our listeners a little update there on what we're talking about here with the polyunsaturates

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 and the saturated fats and the different hormones.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Okay. How about the association of cancer with endotoxin production?

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 Every level you look at practically is a promoting effect.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 There are a few positive effects of endotoxin.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 Our long exposure to these toxins will build up certain defenses,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 but beyond that very basic kind of immunity, which includes things like HDL cholesterol,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 the lipoproteins are defenses against the endotoxins largely.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 So that's one of the defensive effects of high cholesterol.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 And the reactions beyond that very simple level of defense are all pro-inflammatory,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 tend to stimulate development of fibrosis as a sign of deteriorating tissue function,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 and fibrosis and atrophy make the tumor harder to get at and more autonomous.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 The atrophy effect is something that estrogen participates in in many ways.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 The medical establishment has convinced the public that estrogen has some anabolic protective effects,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 especially for the bone preventing osteoporosis,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 but the overall effect of the inflammation produced by endotoxin creates a systemic age-like atrophy of all of the tissues.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Osteoporosis, for example, is extremely sensitive to endotoxin.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 Endotoxin activates all of the factors that stop the bone replacement and accelerate its decomposition,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 and it's those atrophic processes that weaken the immune system's ability to remove a cancer once it starts.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 So atrophy and tumor formation are really very closely connected,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 and endotoxin is pushing on both of those in an unfavorable way.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 Yeah, pretty scary, huh?

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 Okay, so there's, like I was wanting to bring out, the whole thing about your food,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 what you eat and what you shouldn't eat, really should be taken quite seriously,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 just because it's a very inexpensive way to stay healthy.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 There's no drugs involved, there's no treatment involved.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 You're your own doctor, and the more you take care of yourself in terms of what you put into your body,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 the better off you're going to be.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 So just to recap the endotoxin gut bacteria and lipopolysaccharide side of the liberation from the bacteria,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 and the starches, the offending substances.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 Sarah, do you want to cover the offending substances?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Besides the starches, Dr. Beatman, I've already mentioned the breads, the grains, beans, and flowers,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 and starchy root crops.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 Besides those, what other foods will encourage the growth of bacteria that then could subsequently produce endotoxin?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 The so-called fibrous materials, a lot of them are being promoted as health foods.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 Lignin, lignans that are woody materials in many vegetables and grains.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 And like in flax seeds.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 Yeah.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Generally, those tend to have an estrogen-promoting effect and support the growth of bacteria.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 As well as have flax seeds also have PUFA, polyunsaturated fat,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 so those won't be inhibiting the growth of the bacteria like a saturated fat would be.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 Yeah.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 That's interesting. I just want to hold it there very quickly with what you mentioned about lignin,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 because I was just reminded again that the Dow Chemical Company were actually trying to incorporate lignans into bread,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 and they were doing some research at a USDA lab to see whether or not these lignans could be a viable starch source to be put in bread.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 And here, as you've already mentioned, lignans as being one of the other bad foods that could possibly be implicated.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 I think they've used sawdust for many years.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Yeah.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 The cellulose is probably the safest fiber if it's a clean kind of cellulose.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 Yeah, no, they were testing it.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 I'm friends with one of the scientists at the Food Safety Department of the USDA labs in Albany,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 and they were testing to see if they could boost the fiber content.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 And my friend said, "If people are going to eat bread, why can't they just eat whole grain bread?

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 Why do they have to add sawdust into it?"

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 Yeah, as another cautionary warning, I think, to people that are listening,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 the industry is certainly keen to make sure that there are no byproducts of an industry that are not sold.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 So just be aware, there's lots of high fructose corn syrup.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 It's just one of those examples.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 If something isn't naturally occurring, don't be surprised if what you're consuming is a byproduct of another industry

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 that you're being told is actually going to be good for you.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 So it's the whole fish oil thing.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 And then the paint industry with the flax seed oil, how that suddenly became a food source rather than a paint additive.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 Okay, well, back to diet and endotoxin.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 One minute.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 This is your engineer.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 I actually had someone who called up and had a question very much in this line.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 She had a question about pediatric Crohn's disease and a diet that would be good for that.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 Okay. Dr. Peat?

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 I think it's good to try raw carrot.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 It's important how you use the carrot.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 Just eating a raw carrot is fine.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 But if you're going to make a salad, it should be, if possible, grated in a longitudinal way so that you have the longer pieces of fibrous material.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 When you chew it, you'll have pretty elongated fibers.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 You don't want to put it in a blender and definitely don't want to use a juicer.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 The juice isn't protective.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 And it removes most of the fiber as well.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 Okay, so that would be a starting point for pediatric Crohn's.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 And usually having plenty of milk and cheese in the diet is protective.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 The bacteria that grow on milk are generally the safer type of bacteria.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Okay, because when we were studying, I know that Crohn's was lumped together in the inflammatory bowel disorder section of pathology.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 Quite a few people respond well to a thyroid supplement because there's usually that typical stress pattern of high cortisol, high estrogen, low progesterone.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 And thyroid is the hormone that helps to restore the protective hormones and reduce the stress hormones.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 Okay, so for that caller, certainly addition of carrot fiber in terms of carrot salad and then checking thyroid function,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 maybe not necessarily against the medical model of blood tests for TSH and T3 and T4, but measure.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 I know you're a great advocate of the, in fact, it's not yours.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 It was something that you said was always done.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 And up until the 20s or something like that, it was commonly used to diagnose low thyroid.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 And that was taking the resting pulse and temperature as an indicator of thyroid function before and after meals.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 So for that person that called, again, thyroid function can be measured by temperature before and after meals.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 And if anybody wants any more information on that, we'll be happy to send people via email a chart.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 And they can maintain or measure their temperature and their pulses in relation to food.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 This is a very definite pattern to how the temperature should rise and/or the pulse should rise before and after meals.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 So, yeah, between thyroid function and carrot salad and for that caller.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 And plenty of milk and cheese.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 And plenty of milk and cheese. There you go. Right.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 And again, they're always, I don't know, always maligned as mucus-forming products, but it's not true.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 So there's another caller on the line.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 Hi.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 I have a couple questions.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 One was regarding the carrots not being juiced because I use that a lot for someone who has maybe not cancer.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 We don't know yet.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 But any of the cancer diets really call for a lot of vegetable juices and carrot juices as a big one.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 And so the other thing is, I don't know if you ever heard of the Budwig diet,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 but Dr. Budwig, a German woman, she had discovered or introduced combining flaxseed oil with cottage cheese,

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 organic of course, and blending them so that they would bond.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 And that bond would form -- would help cells form a stronger electrical charge

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 so that they could break away and form new cells and not form cancerous or abnormal cell structure.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 So one is on the carrot juice and the other is for the flaxseed oil using that.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 Of course, not the linseed flaxseed oil, but does it change that bacteria when it's combined

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 and bonded with something like cottage cheese?

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 I can take my answer off the air. That's fine.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 All right. Thank you for your call.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 So Dr. Peat, carrot juice.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 One of the oldest treatments for cancer was enemas.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Thousands of years ago, the doctors were recommending regular enemas to treat cancer.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 And a few hundred years ago, laxatives became a standard feature of cancer treatment as well as many others.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 And just about 60 years -- 70 years ago, Max Gerson started -- he cured his own migraines with a change of diet.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 And he was -- in the 20th century, he was the most famous advocate of mostly vegetable diet,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 but he did use liver. Liver juice was one of his components.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 And thyroid, typically a good dose of thyroid was part of his program.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 And so it was a nutritionally rational program.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 But he twice in his book, in capital letters, said absolutely no oils.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 And his followers have changed the book.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 And I think they were influenced by Johanna Budwig and her flax oil and cottage cheese diet.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 In 1954, before Budwig had started writing about cancer,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 a Mexican professor had an article in Prevention magazine advocating, I think it was a cup of linseed oil per day as a purge in the tradition of getting the intestine as clean as possible.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 And when you drink that much of a highly unsaturated oil,

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 the unsaturated fatty acids are converted to prostaglandins and cause intense contraction and secretion of the intestine.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 And so it's a very quick, thorough kind of laxative.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 But that was changed in Budwig's writing several years later to think of the linseed oil as a nutritional factor rather than as a laxative.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 And to the extent that it works as a laxative, it's very, very likely helpful.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 But the rest of her program was curds, cottage cheese basically.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 And that's a very soothing, safe diet that happens to be less able to promote endotoxin than other proteins.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 But I think there are reasons that the vegetables, when you juice them,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 you get lots of minerals that allow you to assimilate the sugars that are present in leafy and other vegetables.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 So the Gerson diet and the Budwig diet had some very rational factors.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 Basically keeping the intestine clean and keeping the thyroid function up, I think, were the most important.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 And Dr. Peat, with the carrot juice, can you explain to our listeners why the carrot juice in particular would be lowering your good hormones?

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 Yeah, the carrot is so rich in carotene.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 When you eat it as a whole vegetable, raw, the fiber keeps you from absorbing almost all of the carotene that passes through you.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 And when you juice, you get quite a bit of good sugar and minerals, but you also get a tremendous amount of carotene.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 And carotene works like unsaturated fats in blocking thyroid function and progesterone function.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 In the early years of treating thyroid patients, they noticed that infertile women often turned out to have a red spot in the ovary in place of the yellow spot,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 which is called the corpus luteum.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 And it was red because such a tremendous amount of carotene had accumulated in it that instead of being yellow, it was a red spot.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 And that indicates both that the thyroid is unable to convert the cholesterol into progesterone

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 and that the vitamin A, which should be used in the conversion, is blocked by the carotene accumulating in the tissue.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 And it's the same with the adrenals.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 The excess carotene blocks adrenal steroid production.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 And if you eat a lot of cooked pumpkin and carrots, I know this time of year we're going to be having our pumpkin for Thanksgiving,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 but if you eat a lot of that all year round, you're going to be absorbing a lot of carotene,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 and that could be blocking your vitamin A receptors and causing these hormonal imbalances.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 If a person has a very vigorous thyroid function and plenty of vitamin B12, they can take care of a lot of carotene.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 But if you notice that the calluses on your hands and feet are starting to get orange tint to them, that means you've got too much carotene.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 Okay. All right. There is another caller on the line. So you're on the air?

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 Hi, yes. Is that me?

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 Yes, you are.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 Hi. I was wondering, I'm 50 and I'm going through menopause,

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 and I'm having for about the last five months these horrific night sweats where I literally have to get up three or four times in the night and change my sheets and everything.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 And somebody recommended orange oil.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 And I wonder what your thoughts were about that and if that is appropriate, and if so, in what way, how does that work?

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 And also, if you could recommend if there's any dietary changes I should make.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 I'm actually vegetarian. I don't drink. I'm pretty healthy.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 Okay. All right. Well, so far as your perspective on that lady's situation, Dr. Peat, would you like to discuss that?

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 I know we've got some certain thoughts on it, but I thought we'd be good to share.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 The highly unsaturated oils like Borage have some short-range beneficial effects by blocking some of the immune inflammatory reactions.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 But that ends up as being an immunosuppressive process down the road.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 And in the long run, it will actually increase inflammatory and stress processes.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 And the quickest way to alleviate the night sweats and hot flushes is to increase your sugar intake and your protein intake.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 The sugar, one of the functions of the sugar is to lower the cortisol and the adrenaline.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 And if your protein intake is too low, it should be 80 grams of good protein.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 And among vegetables, it happens that the potato protein is the only one that ranks up with the animal proteins,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 and it's even better than egg protein.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:09.000
 But the milk, for example, and cheese and eggs and potato are the high-quality proteins.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 And you should have around 80 grams of good protein per day.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 And if you don't get enough sugar or starch in your diet, then you're going to use some of your protein for energy.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 And so that impairs your liver function by starving it for protein.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 When the liver isn't functioning well, it can't store enough sugar to get you through the night with a steady sugar level.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 And first, your adrenaline surges to try to get more sugar out of your liver.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 When your liver is depleted, then your cortisol rises to turn some of your muscle tissue and the thymus tissue and skin and other things into sugar to keep your sugar up to a survival level during the night.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:15.000
 So it's actually the cortisol surges at night that cause the hot flushes.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 And sugar is the first aid. Sugary and salty foods are a quick relief for that,

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 but it has to be against the background of adequate protein and other nutrients.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 I see. And just quickly, you said milk, cheese, eggs, and what was the other one for the protein?

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 Potatoes.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
 Oh, potatoes. Okay.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 And eight ounces of potatoes contains about eight grams of protein.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 It's very similar to milk on a weight basis in terms of quality.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 Eight ounces of milk contains eight grams of protein too.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 So then, gorge oil actually isn't a good thing for me to take?

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 No. One of the things it does is to inhibit your ability to digest and assimilate protein,

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 and it also tends to inhibit your thyroid function, which makes your liver less able to get you through the night without sugar depletion.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
 Okay. And then one more quick question. Is agave a good sugar?

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 Yeah, unless it's been overheated.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 When it's fresh, it's extremely good, but if it's very dark, it's possible that it has become cooked to the point that it's allergenic.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000
 It's a matter of how you react to it.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 I see.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 I think all of those agave nectars, they have to boil them down to some degree, so they are caramelizing the sugar.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 Even if they stay raw, they still have to concentrate them.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 It's not like honey that's just very, very sweet when raw.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 So when you boil the sugars down and you don't filter out the caramelized portion, those are allergenic and carcinogenic.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 Wow. Okay, well, thank you so much. I appreciate it.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 You're very welcome.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 Okay, I don't think there are any more callers on the line at the moment.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:16.000
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, in terms of the endotoxin production by the bacteria that we've been talking about that are feeding on bad foods,

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 and then the starches and those kinds of grains and those kinds of products,

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:30.000
 what's your view on increasing gut motility and decreasing the amount of time it takes from the food to leave the body

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 as a means of reducing endotoxin production?

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 Is that viable in your mind?

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 Yeah, eating the right balance at each feeding, some sugar, some protein, and some fat,

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 and having small meals is usually easy on the intestine.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 Some people feel they have to eat for theoretical nutrition rather than for hunger,

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 and if you force yourself to eat when you're not hungry, that can lead to stress and sluggishness of your intestine.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 Okay.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 I do want to mention some herbs.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 I know we're getting close to the top of the hour, but cascara is an herb that does increase transit --

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 decreases transit time, increases intestinal peristalsis, and is a laxative that if it's been aged properly,

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 which research has shown that if it's sun-dried and then aged for one year,

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 the anthroquinones, which are the compounds in the cascara, are safe and effective in not only decreasing transit time,

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000
 but also as an antibacterial.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 And Dr. Peat, tell us about the structure of tetracycline and cascara.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 There's a series that starts actually with vitamin K.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 It's a quinone structure that has been studied from about 1910 on as an anti-cancer,

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 anti-viral, energy-promoting, respiration-improving, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic substance.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:39.000
 And, for example, vitamin K is now used to strengthen bones, prevent osteoporosis, and prevent calcification of arteries.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 That's a basic vital function that does that tremendous range of functions.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 And the imodin in cascara is just one ring -- it's a three-ring substance.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 And the tetracycline is a four-ring substance, but they're all quinones that are intensified by adding the extra ring.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 So from the vitamin K all the way up to tetracycline, it's a similar biological effect, which has this extreme --

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 it sounds too good to be true to be able to stimulate respiration, be anti-inflammatory, germicidal, anti-cancer, and so on.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 Well, so in case some of our listeners don't know what tetracycline is,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 it's a very broad-spectrum, old antibiotic that has now been mostly replaced by doxycycline.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 I've had plenty of arguments with doctors saying, "Please prescribe tetracycline to this client or that client,"

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 and not doxycycline, which is the new generation tetracycline, which isn't as safe as tetracycline.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 But nature has a very similar compound in cascara as well as in tababouie, otherwise known as pau d'arco.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 And that is not only antibacterial, it's also anti-tumor, anti-fungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 And both of those herbs can be used without having to make them into a tincture.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 They're readily water-soluble, or you can just use the -- cascara, the dose is so low, you can just use a pinch of powder as needed.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 And the tababouie makes quite a nice tea.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 And, Dr. Peat, you were talking to me about a decoction, a boiled wine and tababouie pau d'arco compound.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 Can you tell me a little bit more about the doctor who used that?

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:53.000
 Oh, W.F. Koch was a Michigan chemistry professor who went into medicine.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:03.000
 And he was at the University of Michigan at the time Moses Gomberg discovered free radicals.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 He created a free radical that was 20 or 30 years before chemists would believe that such a thing existed.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 But Koch was there at the university and saw the stuff, understood its properties,

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 and started thinking about what that kind of reaction would mean in the body.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 And he proposed that we have free radicals in the form of quinones in our mitochondria handling energy with creating all of these functions,

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.000
 anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antitumor, and so on.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 And he created a whole range of substances, some more powerful than others.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 And began giving them to cancer patients and allergy patients and even infected cows.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:22.000
 There was a study in California in which they cured various animal diseases with his so-called anti-cancer reagent.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 And the famous Albert St. Georgi, who got the Nobel Prize related to respiration and vitamin C research,

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:46.000
 he based practically his whole career on working out the meaning of Koch's work with the quinones.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 The vitamin K, ubiquinone, is the substance that came much later to be discovered in the mitochondria.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:10.000
 The government twice tried to put Koch in jail saying that it's inconceivable that people could have free radicals in their cells

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 and that it would be toxic if they did.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 But then it turned out that exactly the type of chemical, the quinone, that Koch had postulated turned out to be the essence of how human life creates energy.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000
 Well, Dr. Peat, I'm sorry for cutting you short.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:35.000
 And I know that people are listening would love to hear more of what you have to offer.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:43.000
 Sarah? I know we're running out of time here, but I do want to mention some herbs.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:50.000
 And also, especially coming up to this time of the year with Thanksgiving and Christmas and so many people suffering from so many different infections.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:59:00.000
 A lot of times this gets the gut endotoxin, endotoxin from the bacteria that creates the flu like symptoms and the sniffles and the colds that people get this time of year.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:07.000
 So stock up on your raw carrot salad and some cascara powder.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:13.000
 Tababoui, like I mentioned, Paudarko, another good herb to use is Echinacea.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:22.000
 Also, golden seal, barberry and Oregon grapefruit, those also are antimicrobial if you come down with a nasty bug in your intestine.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:31.000

 Lots of good information. Well, thank you so much for listening and thank you for the callers.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:46.000

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000
 And thank you for your time. And thank you.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.000
