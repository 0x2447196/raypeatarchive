00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 What does cloudy urine indicate? Is it the body wasting calcium or a yeast infection?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Well, if you're drinking lots of milk, for example, or a high meat diet, the phosphate has to get excreted.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 And the phosphate shows up in the urine and precipitates in the presence of either magnesium or calcium.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 And it only precipitates if the pH is above a certain point.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 And so if you have a very high protein diet, most of the time your urine will be acidic and it will be clear despite having a tremendous amount of phosphate in it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 But when something raises the pH of your urine, which can be eating a lot of fruit or vegetables, or hyperventilating is another thing.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 If you blow out too much carbon dioxide, the pH of your urine goes up to keep your blood at the right pH, slightly alkaline.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 And when your urine pH is above, is neutral or higher on the alkaline side, then any phosphate and calcium is going to precipitate and make it cloudy.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 I'll be done. Here's an email from Brenda. I recently started taking Progest-E and it's helped my cyclical mood symptoms very much.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 I've been taking it for days 14, 28 in my cycle. I hate to stop taking it because I have PMS moodiness the day after I stop.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Would there be any harm in just continuing to take it non-stop for a while, even if it means I miss a period or two?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 I've known quite a few women who took it some every day and kept cycling without any problem.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 But what they should be aware of is that if you take a little extra just before the expected time of ovulation, it will trigger early ovulation.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 And then if you stop taking it or take less, it will bring on an early menstruation.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 So if you're going to take it every day, it has to be every day the same amount.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 What about someone perimenopausal that every now and then in the cycle, it just takes a long period, just doesn't want to come.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 I get the bloaty thing, but I just don't want to come. Is there any safe herbs or anything you can do to just kind of let her go so you can feel better and let her have your period?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Well, behind the problem with the balance of progesterone and estrogen, the basic thing is almost always low thyroid.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Some women will use a quick acting thyroid so as soon as they start getting a symptom of PMS, they take just a little extra quick acting stuff and they can adjust the hormones on a day to day basis that way.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Other people increase just knowing that they don't want to have PMS. They will take a little more of their glandular thyroid starting at ovulation.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 And the opposite happens when a person is hypothyroid.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 They might not have any ovulation at all or they might have extreme and prolonged menstruation.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 And it's a very reliable treatment for prolonged menstruation to just get the right amount of thyroid.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 You can usually turn off a hypothyroid excess menstruation in two days with a supplement.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 But a quick acting thyroid, that's generally a prescription?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Yeah, usually in the US, T3 such as Cytomel is a prescription.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Cytomel. How do you spell that?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 C-Y-T-O-M-E-L

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 And that's just a pig or cow or something thyroid, isn't it?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 No, it's a purely synthetic but it's exactly the same chemical that we make or would get from an animal.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Oh, I see. Okay. Mark wants to know, why is burning sugar for fuel healthier for the human body than burning ketones?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Also, for diabetic ones to use fructose medicinally, how can fructose be used by the cells if the cells need glucose?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 And does the body convert fructose to glucose or something?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Yeah, the body can exchange the fructose enters the glycolysis process almost the same place glucose does

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 and then is oxidized the same way glucose is.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 And a lot of doctors are saying that the brain and muscles and heart and such can't use fructose.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 But actually there is evidence that they do have the particular so-called fructose transporter or glucose transporter that works for fructose.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 So the brain and heart can use fructose.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 And ketones are good if you get them from fruit or vegetables such as potatoes.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 But if you have to produce the ketones, they are only produced under stress in the body.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 And so they're good when you can get them but it's hard to make them yourself.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Okay. Why does the Budwig diet against cancer have so much success when it uses omega-3 flaxseed oil

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 and Ray's work has concluded that unsaturated fatty acids are not good for us?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Ask John.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 In 1954, a professor from the University of Guadalajara had an article in Prevention magazine describing his success using purge for his laxative patients to get their intestine clean

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 because that's something that's been known for probably 3,000 years that laxatives are helpful for cancer patients because of the toxins produced in the intestine.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 And he happened to use a cup of linseed oil or flax oil as the purge.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 It would rush right through and clean out the intestine.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 But until that time, Johanna Budwig had published as co-author a couple of articles in a soap and fat journal and wasn't doing anything at all unconventional.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 But right after that article came out in Prevention magazine, she started developing her theory of the N-3 fats.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 My theory was that she had gone insane during that period when she stopped being a research associate for the soap professor.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Shortly after that, several little booklets came out published by a Disney subsidiary in Europe describing her theory in very crazy terms.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Anyone who's interested in doing her program should get a look at those books because they were radically changed when they were presented in English to make it sound much saner than they were.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 But her diet consisted of mostly cottage cheese or the equivalent, curds.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 And because of the low iron content of cottage cheese, both milk and cottage cheese are very good protective foods for people with cancer.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 And milk, because of the low iron content and low PUFA content, are good for cancer patients.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 But I think as far as the flax oil can work as a laxative, it's beneficial.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 But when it's working as a food, then it has the risk of suppressing your metabolism.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 We're talking with Dr. Ray Peat. He's a PhD in biology.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 It is about 15 after the hour. This is Patrick Timpone. Happy New Year to you.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Special show pre-recorded. We'll be back live, I think, on whatever the 4th, next Monday.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 I appreciate you being here. We'll keep Dr. Peat on as long as he doesn't kick us out and try to get rid of through these emails.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 We have a lot of them.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 John, raise opinions on Hans Nieper's mineral transporters. Why does nobody talk about them anymore?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 For one thing, we don't really need mineral transporters.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 People like Gilbert Ling many years ago showed that the doctrine that the cell is enclosed in an impermeable or semi-permeable membrane simply isn't so.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 When they got isotopes that they could actually see the type of sodium atom that was being added to a system,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 they could demonstrate that the sodium atoms were freely moving in and out of cells, no barrier function at all at the surface.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 This applies to all of the dissolved minerals and other substances. There's just no barrier there to deal with.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 That's the basic thing. We don't have any need for a mineral transporter because minerals move freely in and out.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Jesse writes, "I love the show. I don't know if Ray Peat knows anything about the organic sulfur you've been talking about the last few months.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 I've been taking the sulfur and iodine together, Lugol's.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Well, we don't recommend you take the sulfur with anything, but anyway, my thyroid hormones have gone down.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 I need to know if the sulfur will take iodine out too. Should they be taken opposite ends of the day?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 Do you need to take extra Lugol's if you're taking sulfur? I'm taking a couple of tablespoons per day.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Too much iodine is probably the problem.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 Too much iodine that can actually lower the thyroid?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 Yeah.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 How do you know what's a good amount of iodine?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 I've got a list of, I think it's 70 articles from around the world looking at the incidence of thyroid cancer and thyroiditis.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 They see that above half a milligram of iodine per day chronically increases the incidence of thyroid disease.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Well, that's not good. 0.5 milligrams. Wow, that's not a lot, is it?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 No, but that's over a period of many years where it's chronically high.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Oh, okay. In other words, people taking, you'd have to do it over many years to have an issue.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 Yeah.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 I wonder how many drops of Lugol's, do you have any idea, like you do one drop, how many milligrams it is?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 I think it's a few milligrams.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 Is it? So you wouldn't want to do more than just a couple. I mean, that's it.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 Yeah.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Makes sense. Okay. I'm a follower of Mr. Peat's. I haven't seen him, anything mentioned about uterine fibroids.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 What is his suggestion is the best way to get rid of them? Seropeptase and other enzymes have not worked for me.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 I think normalizing thyroid is the best thing. I had an experience with a woman who was, I think she was 40 at the time,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 and hadn't had any kids and wanted to get pregnant, and had a fibroid plugging the end of her uterus by the fallopian tubes,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 about the size of a tennis ball. And I explained the physiology to her and got her confident that she knew what was happening.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 And she adjusted, taking enough thyroid that she could keep her estrogen level down with the other hormones up.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 And it happened that her pulse averaged about 110 per minute. And her doctor told her she would die from keeping her pulse that fast.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 But she had an ultrasound every month, and every month that she kept her thyroid at that level, the fibroid shrank.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 And I think it was around March or April that she started, and by August the fibroid had disappeared and she was pregnant.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Is a slower pulse necessarily better?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 No, generally it's not.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 What could be, well, now we've already been told it is, like I've been exercising a lot and my pulse gets pretty low,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 just my resting pulse sometimes 50 or so, because I do the rebounder. So that could actually be a sign of some kind of weakness?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 Yeah, very often it's hypothyroid, long distance runners.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 Oh, you mean low thyroid?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 Yeah. If you put a person on a treadmill, and in one experiment they had them walk so their pulse stayed about 120 beats per minute.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 And in less than an hour, their blood showed almost no T3, the active hormone.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 And if a person is healthy, as soon as they catch their breath and rest for a day, their T3 is right back where it should be.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 But if there's anything wrong with their diet, just that moderate amount of exercise every day can push your thyroid lower and lower.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 And one of the ways that you might see a bad effect of a low pulse is if the distance between the top and the bottom blood pressure is very great.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 It should be no more than 50 points difference.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 And blood pressure difference, okay.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 Yeah, it's called pulse pressure.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 Okay.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 So the systolic minus the diastolic should be 50 or less.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 But if it's less than 50, a low pulse is...

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Well, sometimes it goes with a big surge of pressure, like from a blood pressure diastolic of 60 to 120.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 That's a 60-point spread, which is more than desirable.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 Okay, so that would indicate perhaps a low thyroid.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 Yeah.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 And you'd want to get that checked out and maybe get that thyroid boosted up.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 So people that exercise a lot, it's not necessarily that their heart...

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 But isn't your heart stronger if you're beating less per minute?

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 Not necessarily.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 No?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 You can give a person an antithyroid drug and their heart rate will just go slower and slower.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 No kidding.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 Antithyroid, in other words, lower the efficiency of the thyroid and your pulse slows down.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Yeah.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 I've known people who had 40 or 50 pulse at rest and who were really very miserable.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 And when they got their pulse up to 70 or 80 at rest by taking thyroid, they felt much better.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 But that's something you don't want to do on your own necessarily.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 It'd be better to get somebody that really knows their stuff.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 You can often do that just by diet, avoiding the foods that are blocking your thyroid function.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Which are?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 Mostly in America, it's mostly the polyunsaturated fats.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 But some people, I've known people who were eating a pure soy diet or a lot of raw cabbage and broccoli.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 And those people just stopping the diet for a week or two popped right back.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 So the poofers in the soy, they're definitely antithyroid.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 But what about broccoli, cauliflower, the cruciferous?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 But if you cook them, are they okay?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 They're still slightly antithyroid, but people don't have any problem with them.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 If a person wants to really test what low thyroid is like, they can juice some cabbage or broccoli raw

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 and drink a glass or two of that per day.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 And you can feel it?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Yeah.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 What are some things that boost the thyroid function?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 The milk and orange juice.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 I'll be darned.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 You know, I love orange juice and I just kind of stayed away.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 I bought into, Doc, that whole too much sugar idea.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 I don't know where I got that, but man, I'll try some of that and juice some oranges.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 And it actually boosts thyroid function.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 Yeah.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 I'll be darned.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 That's great.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 Boy, so much thyroid stuff, as you know.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 Here's another one, Ann from Michigan.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Can you talk a bit about Hashimoto's?

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Is that overactive or autoimmune thyroid, right?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Hashimoto's?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 It's underactive.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Oh, underactive, but it's an autoimmune issue?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 Yeah.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Okay.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Well, so-called.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 So-called.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 Most of the autoimmune things, the antibodies really are part of a recovery process.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Okay.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Anytime you injure a tissue, your immune system will try to eat up the junk.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 And it treats the tissue as if it had been infected.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 So that's why they started calling it thyroid.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 So it's not the immune system attacking your thyroid.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 It's doing what it's supposed to do.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 Yeah.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 If you block the thyroid function for some reason,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 then you have to stimulate it more strongly with thyroid stimulating hormone.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 And just that stimulation creates a type of inflammation.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 And if that goes on too long, for example, blocking it with too much iodine

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 or too much PUFA or estrogen,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 then your immune system will come up in and clean up some of the junk.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 So we have people say that you really can't OD on iodine,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 but you're definitely saying the opposite here today.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Yeah.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 Okay.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 Anne says, "I'm 44 years old, and the day before my period I start to get a headache.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 I'm assuming the headache is caused by low progesterone.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 Any suggestions on how to balance out the hormones?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 I have been doing paleo diet for over three years now.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 It has helped."

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 I know that this is a broad question, but any suggestions would be appreciated.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 Well, usually some good tropical fruit and/or orange juice and milk or cheese

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 will get the thyroid back to normal functioning.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 But in the short run, a thyroid supplement--

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 there have been studies where just giving even a synthetic thyroid for five or six months

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 will correct the antibody problem in the Hashimoto's.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 And then what if somebody has a hard time with casein or lactose?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 Can that be corrected if you'd like to try some cheese and milk?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Yeah, there's no lactose in cheese, so if there's a lactose problem,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 cheese will take care of it.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 Like a raw cheese maybe, raw grass-fed if you can?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Yeah, preferably without additives.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 Sure.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 And then the casein in the milk?

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 It's a good protein.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 It has many good features, but an even better protein is the juice out of a potato.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 In a few extreme cases where a person had no digestion for any kind of ordinary protein,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 if they juiced some raw potatoes and then cooked that juice,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 they could instantly assimilate it.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 And got over their sensitivities of their proteins.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Hasn't that been in the past?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 Or is some kind of an anti-cancer therapy in Europe where they juice potatoes?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Did I read that somewhere?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 I haven't heard of it, but it's an amazing food.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 It's crazy.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Please ask your guest about bioidentical hormone replacement.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 If in favor of it, which testing protocol would be best,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 and when we should stop the treatment?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 It just depends on what the person needs.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 That term can apply to testosterone, progesterone, DHEA, thyroid, any of those.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 But it is also applied to estrogen,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 and it happens that the most dangerous of the estrogens, estradiol, is bioidentical.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 So it doesn't make it safer.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 Whether it's synthetic or natural estrogen, you still have to be very careful.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 Okay, here's another email.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 What does Mr. Peat think about the ketogenic diet?

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 High fat, low carb, low protein.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 What does Ray think about Bulletproof Coffee?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 We whip up coconut oil and butter into your coffee similar to Tibetan tea.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 And what about refined bleach coconut oil expeller pressed?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 Ketogenic diet first.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 Okay.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 Well, I already talked about that.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 It's a matter of stress.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 Anything that stresses you can turn on your production of ketones.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 So it's better to have some sugar in your diet so you don't have the stress that makes the ketones.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 But if you can get ketones from fruit and potatoes, for example, they're fine.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Okay.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 Bulletproof Coffee, ever hear about that?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 We put up coconut oil or butter into your coffee?

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 A lot of people tell me they're doing that, but cream in the coffee is so good.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 Yeah.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 And it mixes nicely where the coconut oil and butter just float on the surface.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 Yeah.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Cream probably does the same thing.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 What about refined bleach coconut oil or expeller pressed?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Any issues there?

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 That's the only thing I've used.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 Uh-huh.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 Because I used to occasionally get some homemade coconut oil that was just delicious for making ice cream, coconut ice cream.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 With fresh coconut, it's just a fantastic taste.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 But it happens to be allergenic.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 If you have any stress problems or digestive problems, it's better to use the refined deodorized coconut oil.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 Brian in Illinois has a question for Dr. Ray Peat.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 I would like to know what to do to overcome radiation therapy.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 I was not foolish enough to receive radiation.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 I was foolish enough, excuse me, for prostate.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 I did not finish the total number of treatments.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 But following the treatments, I'm still having radiation issues.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 I no longer have cancer, which I think is probably the result of holistic.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 So how can you kind of heal from radiation kind of damage?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 There have been studies of people 60 years, I think it was, after Hiroshima and 20 years after Chernobyl,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 in which they could still see inflammatory processes in the blood that could be traced to the radiation exposure.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Wow.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 And so it's really a lingering inflammation that you have to deal with.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 With that kind of radiation, nothing is actually placed in the body like with fallout.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 The stuff we're getting from Fukushima now is actual isotopes which stick in the body.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 Those are a different kind of problem.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 The lingering effect of external radiation puts you into an inflammatory state.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 And all of the things we've been talking about, the good high-energy foods, milk, cheese.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 How to heal that.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 Yeah.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 And so the thyroid function activates the repair system, which lowers inflammation.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 And any time your energy falls, you move towards inflammation.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 So don't hyperventilate.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 Do everything to keep your blood sugar steady.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 The inflammation will gradually subside. The anti-inflammatory hormones are all protective in their situation.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 But basically diet and thyroid are.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 William is a naturopathic doc, and he wants to know, Dr. Peat, what you think about Dr. -- not Dr. --

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 but Brian Peskin's claims that omega-3s are unnecessary.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 The fish oils and these parent essential oils that we mentioned earlier are the best way to go to supplement rather than fish oil.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Well, he's right about the fish oil.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 There's no evidence that it's an essential fat.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 But also there is no evidence that I've seen --

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 That the PEOs do it either.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Yeah.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 Sounds good.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 Let's see.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 What's the best way, writes Catherine, about testing for food allergies regarding the heart rate?

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 My heart rate's about 85, sitting down, standing up about 110.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 I was told I had POTS, postural orthostatic tricardia.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 My blood pressure is good but a bit on the low side, including Celtic sea salt in my diet.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 So first off, yeah, best way to -- have you come up with some good ways to test for these food allergies that we may have?

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 The blood tests are often misinterpreted.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 You can see a reaction in the blood, but sometimes it's just showing that the person tolerates -- has been exposed to a food,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 doesn't really correlate with the symptoms of allergy.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 So I think testing a food, leaving it out of your diet entirely for at least a week,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 if the symptoms go away, then you can guess that you're allergic to it.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 But there's no real chemical test for the allergic reaction.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 And then an issue when you're sitting down and standing up, you've got some kind of --

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 high estrogen affects the nervous system so that your sympathetic side is weak and the parasympathetic is overactive.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 And that's why women get varicose veins so much more often than men, especially around pregnancy.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 High estrogen weakens the wall of the vein.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Progesterone tones up the veins.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 And when the veins aren't returning the blood to the heart, when the blood falls into your legs, then your heart has to beat faster.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 So progesterone and thyroid are the things needed to tone up the veins and return the blood to the heart so that the heart has a good, strong beat.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 Does Dr. Peata have any recommendations for rebuilding or healing the vagus nerve,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 encouraging the parasympathetic system and proprioception?

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Parasympathetic, that's when we can rest and sleep, and the vagus nerve, I guess some kind can get damaged.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 Well, my last few newsletters have been talking about the problems of stress.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 For example, learned helplessness, it's called learned despair.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 If an animal is restrained and doesn't have the experience of being able to escape,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 they might just, if they fall into a tank of water, might let themselves drown in two or three minutes,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 where a normal rat with better experience would swim for days.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 And that's from too much of the parasympathetic activity.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 So I've been working out some of the implications of what happens after middle age that are equivalent to learned helplessness,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 where the body has experienced so many problems that it can't deal with,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 that it starts shifting too strongly to the parasympathetic.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 And when we go to bed at night, normally we don't need to spend a lot of energy,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 so the parasympathetic lowers our blood sugar.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 But after middle age, it can lower the blood sugar so much that then the other side of the nervous system reacts with surges of adrenaline and cortisol.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 And that's where the degenerative things come in.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 But they can be triggered by compulsive overactivity of the parasympathetic and vagus.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 And in liver disease, for example, they found that they can prevent inflammation and fibrosis of the liver just by cutting the vagus nerve so it doesn't reach the liver.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 So you don't want to overstimulate the parasympathetic.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 And the Gulf War syndrome, a lot of it had to do with exposure to organophosphate nerve gases.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 But people are being exposed to similar chemicals in insecticides or even in the airliners, which comes from the lubricants in the air pressurizing system,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 which puts basically a little bit of nerve gas into the air and all of these exposures are creating an overactive vagus syndrome.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 So that many people in the general population have something like the Gulf War syndrome.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 Just from the chemicals.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 And the drugs that the Army used to treat nerve gas poisoning, atropine was the main drug.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 And that can be used for an extreme case of some of these stress-related learned helplessness syndromes.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 Next email for Dr. Peat, what is the underlying cause of severe allergies, runny nose, sneezing that occur after a meal?

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Is it low thyroid, high estrogen or both? And how to correct this?

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 It's usually something in the intestine, not necessarily what you ate in this meal.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 But sometimes what you ate yesterday or the day before will be farther down your intestine and eating starts the peristalsis and it moves an irritant down to a sensitive place in the intestine.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 And runny nose and sneezing are the main, most common symptoms.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 But that kind of stimulation in the intestine, animal experiments and even one doctor's experiments on his medical students showed that just pressure in the rectum or intestine can trigger migraine headaches, runny noses and coughing and sneezing and even epileptic seizures.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 Just from stimulating the intestine, but disturbed blood sugar intensifies the sensitivity of the intestine and makes those reactions worse.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 Is there such a thing as thyroid resistance, high reverse T3 that doesn't show up on blood tests?

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 Yeah, I think it's important to measure reverse T3 if you're going to measure the thyroid hormones at all.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 You can't interpret the T3 itself, which is the active hormone, unless you know how much reverse T3 there is because that can interfere with the active hormone.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 So you have to look at the ratio of active to reverse T3.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 Here's an email that said that after eating peanuts, his mouth cracked and inflammation, lesions and a lab said he had fungus candida.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 I'm on a homeopathic remedy, currently using Benadryl, which may provide short-term relief, but inflammation returns.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 Was he just allergic to peanuts? Isn't that simple as that?

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 That could be, but when it lingers for a long time, there could be several things.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 A nutritional deficiency might have been co-acting with the allergy and a lot of B vitamin deficiencies can make sores around the mouth.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 Inflammation in the intestine can activate viruses to break out inside the mouth or on the lips.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 So a food allergy is often responsible for a coated or cracked tongue, a lot of different mouth symptoms.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 The Benadryl lotions are antiseptic and soothing.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 Another ointment that you can get at a drugstore, benzocaine ointments and similar local anesthetics.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 Benzocaine happens to be antiseptic as well as anesthetic and will often clear up a little skin problem, whether it's a virus or germ or fungus.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 Benzocaine ointment can help.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 Lindsay says she's on low thyroid. She has a low thyroid on 120 milligrams of Nature Thoy, but still experiencing many symptoms.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 I'm not sure where she lives, 917, I think that looks like Southern California.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 I'm wondering if you could have ideas on where she could find some help.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 People can email me through my website, has my contact.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 But if a particular brand of thyroid doesn't work, I think it's good to change brands.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Armor thyroid is fairly reliable.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 There's a synthetic called Proloid S, which is an old established brand that is available in many countries.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 Ceno Plus is made by companies related to the ones that make Cytomel.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 Ceno Plus is very similar to Nature Throid and Armor, but being synthetic, it lacks some of the potential allergens that the natural thyroids might have.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 So just trying different brands and otherwise changing the diet to make sure there's more of the metabolic promoters such as calcium and the anti-inflammatory foods.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 Only a few more here, then we're going to let you go, Doc.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 Meg writes, "Dr. Peat's website has removed his bookstore for his newsletter and books. Are you going to get that back?"

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 Yeah, when I get the books reprinted, I'm going to put the list back.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 Okay, but right now people cannot sign up for your newsletter or can they?

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 Oh, yeah, they can.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 On the website?

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 Yeah.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 Okay, we've already done that one. Let's see.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 "What is the ideal diet for type 2 diabetes? What food should I avoid? I'm taking a thousand milligrams of L-tryptophan at night for sleep. Do you recommend I discontinue this amino acid?"

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 Yeah, there are articles on my website about related to diabetes and explaining how the unsaturated fats are an essential problem in causing diabetes and sugar is not a problem and has been used as a cure.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 So getting the right diet and making sure the thyroid function is optimized, those are the basic things.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 Aspirin is well-known to help to regulate blood sugar and lower inflammation problems associated with diabetes.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 Stella says, "I keep getting acne. I don't know how to deal with it. I sweat and saunas and take chlorella and make green smoothies but still have issues with acne. What can I do?"

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 Thyroid and vitamin A are the basic things but the skin and the intestine are very closely connected so that you want to make sure you aren't eating any foods that aren't well digested or that irritate your intestine because that can contribute to inflammatory and even

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 problems with excretion of fats and sweat and so they can be influenced by irritation in the intestine.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 Lisa wants to know about using the far-infrared sauna and niacin together if you have broken capillaries from rosacea. How do you say it? R-O-S-A-C-E-A?

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 Rosacea? Yeah, rosacea. Using niacin with a far-infrared sauna.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 Well, niacin sometimes refers to nicotinic acid or even its slow release form and nicotinic acid happens to increase your histamine, serotonin and prostaglandins, all of which are inflammatory.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 So I don't think it's good for anyone to take nicotinic acid other than it occurs in food and niacinamide is a form of that same vitamin that is active in cells and doesn't release those inflammatory problem materials.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 So niacinamide is safe? Yeah.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 That's the B3, is that B3? Yeah.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 Brenda writes, could you please ask Dr. Peat to speak about natural ways to reverse high prolactin levels in women? I recently started taking his Progest-E to raise my progesterone levels, hoping this may help to lower my prolactin.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 Sometimes it does, but thyroid is the basic thing. The tryptophan and serotonin happen to turn on a trigger that increases prolactin and thyroid stimulating hormone.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 They tend to go together and if your thyroid doesn't respond adequately to the rising thyroid stimulating hormone, it isn't able to lower the prolactin.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 They're tied closely together and so a supplement of thyroid is sometimes needed, but without that, sometimes increasing the salt in your diet and using a vitamin B6 supplement, those can sometimes correct the prolactin.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 The B6 is involved in correcting the tryptophan, serotonin metabolism so it doesn't cause the inflammation and hyperlactin.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 One more and then Ray Peat gets to go on about his day. Thanks for being here. I appreciate all your time. Really been a long show, which has been great.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Carl in Urbana, it's an interesting one. He's in his 70s. He's observed lower thyroid, testosterone, muscle tone, increase in estrogen.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 Recently he was thinking that the Eskimos live in a very cold climate and they said to be eating a diet of 70% fat.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 He did that. He said, "I no longer feel cold all the time and my energy and sleep are much better.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 I've seen to be in an adrenaline state early in the evening and sometimes awake with higher temperature and a higher pulse rate.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 Then I can get back to sleep and progress into colder, lower pulse rate, thus a high cortisol state.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 Since my cortisol is the highest in the morning, would it be best for me to avoid any foods that would stimulate insulin production in the morning?

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 Could you explain what is going on here?"

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 It's normal. The whole thing that we've been talking about, the parasympathetic system increasing at night lowers your blood sugar and that increases adrenaline.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 Finally, during the night, it will increase your cortisol so that almost everyone has their highest cortisol of the day at dawn.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 That's because basically darkness is very stressful and cortisol is protecting us against all of those inflammatory stress processes that develop during the night.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 If you can keep the adrenaline and cortisol lower by what you eat at bedtime or even snack on during the night and having some fluid in the night helps to keep your blood clean and circulating so that you are less likely to have a stroke from the high cortisol when you wake up.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 The high cortisol and thickened blood are fairly dangerous in the morning so it's good to start with orange juice, for example, to get some fluid and minerals into your blood.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 In the morning?

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 Yeah, and to get the cortisol down.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 What would you drink in the middle of the night? Just water?

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 That's better than nothing but if you're having a sleep problem, then maybe juice or milk, sugared milk and even chicken soup, something that appetizes.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 Maybe chicken broth?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 Yeah, a good chicken consomme with plenty of salt will lower your adrenaline.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 It lowers your adrenaline, the salt does. Yeah, it's good for the adrenals.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 Yeah, there have been studies on people with, old people with both hypertension and insomnia who are on a low salt diet and low salt is very often responsible for serious problems such as that.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 And again, foods then that lower adrenaline and cortisol at night would be?

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 Milk and honey or sugar, fruit, oranges, tropical fruit, gelatinous things such as consomme.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 Oh, bone broth, like the Western Price bone broth stuff, that kind of thing?

00:47:48.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 Well, you don't want to use marrow bones because of the high iron content, so the joints that have the tendons and cartilage attached.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 Oh, just kind of leg bones and stuff like that?

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 Or tail bones.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 Tail bones, but not the joints where they get all the, I thought the cartilage, didn't Dr. Peat, doesn't that have a lot of good?

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 You do want the cartilage and the tendons, you don't want the hard bone with the marrow in it.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 Oh, okay, you want the more joints, so you don't want the hard marrow bones.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 Yeah, so the tail is all joints and so that's very good.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:37.000
 So chicken feet and stuff like that are good, but not shin bones and that that you give the dog, those big hard bones, they have too much iron in the marrow?

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 Yeah.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 That's interesting. Well, Doc, this has been great fun, thanks for being here.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 Oh, okay.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 Yeah, it's been really nice, thanks for spending so much time with us and great way to start off the new year.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 So your newsletter is available on Raypeat.com, right, that people can sign up, and how often do you send that out?

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 Every two months.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 And you do a lot of writing on your website, do you have books as well?

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 Yeah, five books.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 And you're going to get that back in the bookstore, are they available on Amazon?

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 No, I'll probably have some on Amazon when I get them reprinted, it'll be a couple months.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 Well, we'll keep an eye on that. Sir, thanks a lot and we dearly appreciate your time.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 Thank you.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 Thank you. Dr. Ray Peat, well that was quite fun, man, a couple hours there, didn't we? You had a good time?

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 Nice man.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 Raypeat.com, okay baby, take that to the bank and see what you think.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 Please pass on these links to everyone that you care about.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 We just keep digging and digging, seeing if we can figure out how these old bodies work, right?

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 How these old bodies work.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 How these young bodies work.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 Excuse me.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
 Happy New Year.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 Sharon kept me up late, like all, till five, just kidding.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 Adam Bergstrom will be here next Monday and that's when I'll be back live with you, Monday the 6th of January.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 I love you all very much.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 Ah, 2014's going to be a blast, baby.
