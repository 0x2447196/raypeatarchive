00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.460
 Nothing is more expensive than bad information.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.200
 Know the source.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.200
 OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.960
 Well, very pleasant good morning to you.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.160
 This is Patrick Timpone and this is OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.400
 Welcome to part two of our little show.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.040
 Ben Swan, investigative reporter.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.360
 He'll be here tomorrow and then also George Wiseman.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.680
 We have a couple cool guests too coming up on Wednesday.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.680
 Sorry, we're not able to put on the video on the front page of OneRadioNetwork this

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.680
 morning.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.240
 It was just a technical thing but if you'd like to, Dr. Peat's on the telephone anyway

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.720
 and you've seen me enough.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.920
 So whatever.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 The audio is just great.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.100
 You're listening on the audio stream.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.280
 You can join us by sending an email, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.280
 We want to do just the emails this morning.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.200
 We've had lots of rain here which is interfering with our telephone line that the 800 number

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.200
 is on.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.800
 So, you know, mercury is in retrograde so things happen.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.800
 So welcome to the show.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.120
 It is September 21, 2020.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:27.700
 Ray Peat is a PhD and he started his work with hormones back in 1968.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:39.340
 He wrote his dissertation in '72 and wrote a lot about progesterone and things.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.280
 He's on our show on the third Monday of each month at around 10.30 and that's what time

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.420
 it is now.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.900
 His website is RayPeat.com and we'll tell you how you can get his newsletter there.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.300
 That comes out every few months.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.180
 So let's say hi to Dr. Peat.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.180
 Hello, Dr. Peat.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.180
 Good morning.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.260
 Good morning.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.900
 How are things up there in the Northwest?

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:10.340
 The rain started a couple of days ago and we had terrible smoke, the worst in the world

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.820
 for about a week but now it's cleaned out and it's breathable.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:23.380
 You were right in the kind of the belly of the beast on the forest fires and things?

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:31.740
 Yeah, and we're at the south end of the Lamment Valley and the smoke just settled into the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.900
 valley and was very concentrated there from Portland to Eugene.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.100
 Can you even, do you go outside at all?

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.260
 No, no.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.340
 That finally got me wearing a mask.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.900
 The only time I went out I put on an N95 mask and that improved it faintly.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.540
 But the most deadly smoke particles are even smaller than the coronavirus.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.780
 The coronavirus goes through the N95 filter so the worst of the smoke still gets through

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:18.580
 the N95 filter but it takes out the bigger chunks, bigger than bacteria chunks.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:26.260
 How, I want to dig into the virus thing again and before we start taking emails, by the

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.420
 way the email is patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:40.420
 How in your opinion is pollution and such playing into this whole corona thing?

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.900
 Is it part and parcel, do you think, of why people are getting sick?

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.300
 The highest mortality was concentrated in the highest pollution areas.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:01.620
 Wuhan, for example, was terribly, almost opaque air with industrial pollution.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.420
 Italy, super polluted.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:14.620
 New York City, traffic and surrounding industries, high pollution.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.500
 So walk us through how this would work.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.500
 First off let me ask for those of you, this may be a repeat if you've heard them before

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.780
 but we have new listeners all the time around the world.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:39.540
 Do you believe that there is a unique, a virulent, a potentially deadly communicable virus that

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:53.500
 is out there that people can breathe in and hence have coronavirus?

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:07.820
 That's sort of the story told by the government representatives.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:15.460
 That story is what's being used as a basis for locking people down and making them wear

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.660
 masks.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:30.180
 But the way you stated it, it's possible but absolutely no evidence that there is such

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.180
 a thing.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.180
 Possible but no evidence.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.180
 No evidence.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.700
 Wow.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.740
 So in your opinion, with all your years of research Dr. Peat, when we go through these

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:52.460
 cycles of flus and such, what do you think is going on?

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.500
 Unpack that for us.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.140
 What do you think is going on?

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:13.140
 The various viruses that affect the lungs, when they are associated with a lung infection,

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:22.060
 as far as I know, as far as the evidence indicates, it's always a susceptible lung that gets

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.820
 infected no matter what the virus or the pollution.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:36.860
 A young person is generally very resistant to pollution.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:46.220
 Things like altitude and weather affect how your lung reacts to the various agents, whether

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.660
 they're virus or pollution particles.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:07:00.980
 So if your lung is already a little bit on the edge of being sick, a very mild virus

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:09.140
 can tip it over the edge or a moderate amount of pollution can bring on a deadly asthma

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.460
 attack for example.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:26.060
 The sickness and hospitalization and death and so on always tries to explain what the

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.940
 cause of the sickness is.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:37.860
 That's a big part of medicine, identifying causes, but there's never a single cause.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:45.300
 It's always the soil that the agent falls on that determines whether it can grow into

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.020
 something.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:08:02.700
 So a case of lung cancer or a case of influenza or pneumonia from unknown cause, these cases

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:13.260
 always are somewhat making a guess of what the specific agent was that tipped the balance

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.820
 over into sickness.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:23.580
 Generally ignored in medicine is something like nutrition.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:33.420
 A vitamin D deficiency added to a vitamin A deficiency and a lot of previous sicknesses

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:42.900
 that weaken the system, those pre-existing conditions are really determining causes of

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:51.580
 whether a specific little virus or dust particle is going to tip you over into sickness.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:09:02.940
 The viruses and pollution particles all start acting in very similar ways at one of the

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:11.460
 early stages of actually developing or not developing a sickness in response to an air

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:20.460
 pollution or virus in the lung is the activation of a particular cluster of molecules called

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.180
 the inflammasome.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:32.380
 If that is activated, then that triggers the so-called cytokines that then go out and do

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:37.300
 particular things that turn on inflammation.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.940
 So what was that word you used before cytokines?

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.660
 Inflammasome.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.340
 Inflammasome.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:53.740
 So these inflammasomes are already in my body right now and in your body.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.780
 It's a part of our preparatory immune system.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:03.860
 It's just sitting there waiting to make a decision whether it should react and turn

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:11.300
 on the cytokines and there are stabilizing factors too that affect its decision.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:21.740
 So I go out and I get some pollution, my inflammasomes react to the pollution creating cytokines

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.860
 to help get rid of the smoke?

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:34.180
 Yeah, that create the actual inflammation that can change circulation and start producing

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:43.620
 antibodies and all kinds of defensive things as well as if you're not very strong, the

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:53.060
 inflammasome can then get out of control and create a cytokine storm.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:11:03.940
 One cytokine activating more inflammasomes and creating a potentially lethal condition.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:12.900
 But the immune system normally, almost always in reasonable health stops the process before

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.260
 it gets amplified.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:25.420
 The particular worry about the coronavirus, this particular thing is that it attaches

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:38.580
 to the so-called receptor particle, a protein on the surface of cells or near the surface

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:50.420
 called the ACE2 protein and it's called ACE2 because it's an antitensin converting enzyme

00:11:50.420 --> 00:12:03.820
 that is the opposing force against the antitensin converting enzyme that causes high blood pressure.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:15.140
 So if you need an ACE inhibitor for high blood pressure, that's because the antitensin converting

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:22.340
 enzyme is making too much antitensin which creates inflammation and high blood pressure.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:36.940
 If the ACE2 enzyme knocks out that inflammatory agent antitensin, so we're in balance.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:46.100
 ACE2 on the surface of cells is there to stop the inflammation at an early stage and prevent

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.100
 high blood pressure and all of the problems.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:13:03.980
 If the virus has a chance to replicate and produce trillions of viral envelopes, it's

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:13.100
 the surface of the virus that attaches to the so-called receptor ACE2 and in attaching,

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:23.100
 it knocks out the first row of defensive proteins.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:31.420
 So the coronavirus does have this particular feature which is to knock out our defensive

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:36.860
 anti-angiotensin enzyme.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:48.340
 But all you have to do basically is use the ACE inhibitor drugs that are already in existence

00:13:48.340 --> 00:14:03.260
 and you can support that defensive ACE2 system which the virus tends to suppress.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:12.420
 But so the inflammation is part of the process, right?

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:23.180
 So if we do anti-inflammatories to get rid of inflammation, are we prohibiting the process

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:27.740
 to go on smoothly and to heal?

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:37.980
 No, some people worry that they think of inflammation as the cure rather than the problem, but people

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:44.580
 are dying of the inflammatory process, not of the presence of the virus.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:53.860
 The virus unleashes our intrinsic inflammatory processes and it's those, the cytokine storm

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.540
 that kills us.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:05.460
 And so what we need is support for our intrinsic anti-inflammatory system.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:13.940
 You can pretty much forget about killing the virus because the virus itself isn't the immediate

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:14.940
 problem.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:23.700
 It's a potential trigger of a problem, but the killing factor is the activation of our

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.980
 own inflammatory process.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:39.700
 So all of the successful treatments, azithromycin combined with hydroquinone, those are both

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.340
 essentially anti-inflammatory factors.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:55.580
 Aspirin, progesterone, the glucocorticoids, the anti-inflammatory steroids, all of those

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.220
 are recognized cures.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:06.540
 People wouldn't have died if they had been treated with these natural anti-inflammatory

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:15.740
 substances instead of pumping oxygen into their lungs, which increases the inflammation.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.740
 With the ventilators.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:17.740
 Yeah.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:24.900
 But there's still, to go back to make sure I'm understanding what you're saying, the

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:33.540
 whole process was triggered maybe by nutrition or pollution or stress or something with the

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.660
 inflammasome that was already in the body.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.740
 Yeah.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:54.660
 Everything tends to, the decision whether to increase inflammation or not increase it

00:16:54.660 --> 00:17:00.060
 involves that cluster of proteins, the inflammasome.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:06.100
 So, that ties into the whole idea that you talked about or of others that Pasteur and

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:12.420
 the germ theory thing really doesn't work, the model that he built.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.420
 Yeah.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:21.940
 It works in a certain percentage of people who are on the edge, who are infectable and

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:31.300
 not only are able to support the growth of the bacteria or virus, but who respond to

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.620
 it badly.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:46.700
 There was a famous experiment in dairy cows in Canada many years ago in which an immune

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:57.460
 stimulating system was given to cows with mastitis and the number of bacteria in their

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:05.260
 udders had been measured when they were sick with the inflammatory condition.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:14.700
 And then when they were cured with this chemical, there was no inflammation, but they found

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.020
 that there were even more bacteria in their udder.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:26.980
 The udder had simply stopped responding badly to the presence of bacteria.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:36.980
 That was a very powerful example of the soil being the problem rather than the bacterium.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:52.620
 So, bottom line, you're suggesting there is no real unique virulent communicable virus

00:18:52.620 --> 00:19:00.660
 that is being spread or not spread through masking, social distancing or sheltering in

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.660
 place.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:11.220
 There are those viruses, but there is no evidence at all that anything different happened this

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.620
 year than happens every year.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:26.140
 In previous years, something like 10 to 15% of people in the hospital with a lung condition

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:33.660
 were tested positive for coronavirus and about the same number for influenza virus.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:38.620
 About half of the cases, they couldn't find any cause at all.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:45.380
 They were just sick from maybe pollution or something they ate causing a lung disease

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.180
 similar to the viruses.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:20:02.580
 So, those previous studies showed how relatively meaningless it is to say so many people die

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:12.580
 every year from influenza when there were several times more people hospitalized with

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:22.660
 influenza who didn't have influenza agents but had something else including half of them

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:27.340
 with no identifiable pathogen in their lung.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.100
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.980
 Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:38.140
 He's here on the third Monday of the month, RayPeat.com.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.340
 And it's RayPeat'sNewsletter@gmail.com, right?

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.980
 To get your newsletter, Ray Peat's newsletter.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:52.620
 To get his newsletter that comes out every few months.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:58.620
 What then can our listeners around the world think about or consider or even make some

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:13.580
 sense out of all of this talk about a vaccine that's coming to end the coronavirus pandemic?

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:24.100
 The best evidence that I've seen shows that the actual association of sickness with the

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.380
 presence of the coronavirus, it dropped off.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:36.180
 To nothing by the middle of June, the way flu season ends when people start getting

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:46.740
 sunlight and start moving around outside doing normal things rather than huddling against

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:51.820
 the weather in an artificially heated house.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:59.100
 Those things end the flu season, and the evidence shows that it did the same for the coronavirus

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.660
 associated with sickness.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:08.900
 What has come back, they're talking about cases now.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:13.180
 They have changed the language radically.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:25.980
 A case used to mean a sickness that was clearly associated with the cause of the sickness.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:32.180
 If a test is positive for the virus, even when the person is healthy, they're calling

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.540
 it a case.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:45.460
 They should be saying that testing has increased and they're finding lots of new positive virus

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:51.940
 results on their tests, but they're saying cases are increasing in proportion to the

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.500
 number of tests they give.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:23:02.940
 But the sickness has gone for the season or maybe permanently simply by changing language,

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:10.020
 saying things that never were described as a case, calling the positive test result a

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.620
 case of coronavirus.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:18.020
 That is the basis for saying we need the vaccine.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.020
 I see.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:26.340
 So at the beginning, the term cases was actually referred to somebody with symptoms?

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.500
 Yeah, who was a second person.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.940
 A second person.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:39.460
 And now it's gone back to change just anybody that's testing positive on either of the two

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.460
 tests.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:48.100
 You and other people have said that these do not really prove a, again, virulent, unique,

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.660
 communicable, potentially deadly virus in that person.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.660
 Correct?

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.660
 Yeah.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.980
 And there are two kinds of tests that they're giving.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:02.060
 One is the polymerase chain reaction.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.060
 PCR.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.060
 Yeah.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:10.460
 That represents the presence of at least some part of the virus, not even the whole infectious

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:15.220
 virus, but some fragment of it is present.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:20.140
 The other is the presence of antibodies in your blood.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:27.420
 The antibody test means that you have been exposed to the virus enough to form the antibodies,

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.900
 but it doesn't mean you were ever sick or will be sick.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:36.020
 If anything, it should mean that you're resistant to it.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.020
 It should be.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.020
 I mean, logically, right?

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.820
 If you have created antibodies because your body, that's what it does.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:47.140
 But even these people, these are being categorized as new cases.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.140
 Yeah, cases.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:53.340
 So, if you change the language, you can make anything appear to happen.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.340
 Yes, sir.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:25:02.620
 If the person is only listening to the language and thinking in terms of the old reality,

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:06.180
 that's how fraud works.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.220
 Yes, sir.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.220
 Words of art.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:17.620
 I must be curious of how this whole model could be used around the world and using these

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:23.780
 words of art that aren't true, fascinating how this could be going on at such a large

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:24.780
 scale.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:29.380
 There was a lot of organization behind it.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:39.460
 If you look at the Rockefeller Foundation, the World Trade Forum, and the Gates Foundation,

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:47.420
 they've been collaborating for a long time preparing scenarios for exactly this.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:26:00.460
 And their answer for each version, they prepared reaction patterns, what the governments should

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:10.980
 be doing to specifically a coronavirus pandemic before there was one, but they were preparing

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.740
 what to do.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:19.380
 And their recommendations that they worked out in detail and had government officials

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:28.540
 around the world through the World Health Organization getting prepared for when the

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:42.780
 planned pandemic occurred, the plan was already in place in many governments that participated

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:53.260
 in these meetings to shut down the economy, and the purpose was to shift to a digital

00:26:53.260 --> 00:27:04.380
 online economy, online medicine, online education, online shopping, online transportation.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.500
 Wow, fascinating.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.780
 And that's what's going on, just like clockwork.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:17.340
 Yep, very, very highly organized, years and years in advance.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.780
 Fascinating.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.060
 So what was the name of that?

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.700
 Was it 201 or something?

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.620
 Yeah, Event 201.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:30.940
 Event 201, and they laid out this whole thing.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:38.140
 And then, and it's curious of how these different huge organizations like Twitter, YouTube,

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.740
 Facebook have...

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:52.020
 Oh, Schmidt, the former executive of Google, shifted over to the Pentagon, and an agency

00:27:52.020 --> 00:28:03.700
 of the Pentagon, which was a supporter of the whole development of the Google system.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:16.660
 So this executive representing Pentagon and Google and the other giant online organizations

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:27.380
 put out a detailed description of how we should be acting a year in advance, a full year in

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:41.340
 advance of May of, or spring of 2019, I'm not sure the exact date, but a year later,

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:51.020
 when the pandemic did come into existence, he was recruited by our governor Cuomo in

00:28:51.020 --> 00:29:00.860
 New York to start putting that plan expressed publicly a year earlier, to start putting

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:10.100
 that digital system into improving education, medicine, and economy in the state of New

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.980
 York.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.260
 And it's not working.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:22.620
 And New York is, it's a disaster zone, isn't it, with all of these dynamics we're looking

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.620
 at?

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:29.180
 Yeah, I don't think it's really going to work anywhere, especially if people can't

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:39.700
 catch on and realize that the collapse of their business and their employment has been

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:52.100
 pre-planned to shift wealth to the organizations like Google and the Gates and the members

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.660
 of the World Economic Forum.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:08.460
 In just the several weeks that the pandemic has been occurring, most of the billionaires

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.380
 have doubled their wealth.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.780
 Yeah, I saw that.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:20.900
 And I think there's plenty of evidence that the possibility of a world digital kind of

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.660
 a currency thing is all part of this as well, to reset something.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.300
 I don't know what they want to do.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.300
 There's so much debt.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:35.500
 It must be, it feels like there's some kind of plan, Dr. Peat, to redo the whole financial

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.100
 system somewhere.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:47.060
 Yeah, when they're putting everything, killing private middle-sized and small businesses,

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:54.860
 shutting down job opportunities, when they're doing that, people are going to start saying,

00:30:54.860 --> 00:31:06.700
 "Well, we can have a cash economy and get things running again on a privately, individually

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.660
 organized scheme."

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:21.500
 But if the government declares that $20 bills and $100 bills are no longer legal, you can

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:34.060
 only use credit cards, and so all of your money exists only on the computer system represented

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.620
 by monopoly banks.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:46.260
 If your money exists only on your credit card, then whatever rules are passed can instantly

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.940
 make your money disappear.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:58.980
 All I have to do is announce that paper money is no longer legal to use.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.740
 Which I suspect is doable.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:08.340
 I mean, I know in 1933 they made gold illegal, and they told people they had to turn in all

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:11.580
 their gold, and people did it.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.180
 Yeah, that was just the first step.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:20.180
 Yeah, so if you think about it on those terms, I guess it's really possible, Dr. Ray Peat,

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:27.900
 that this whole thing is a long-term kind of plan and not just something that happened

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.700
 the last few years.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:41.700
 Yeah, there have been economists essentially working for the giant monopoly before there

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:53.020
 were billionaires and multimillionaires operated in the same way, trying to optimize the way

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:58.500
 government worked to support their interests.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:07.300
 And so they saw that gold gave power to the common person.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:13.980
 If you owned a chunk of gold, you had some power under your control.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:25.140
 But the owners of the system, the powerful monopolists, used the government to outlaw

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:30.380
 gold to take that power away from the common person.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:40.460
 And digitalizing money is just the ultimate thing to take actual money power or purchasing

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:48.580
 power or any power at all away from everyone who isn't authorized by the World Economic

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.580
 Forum.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.220
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.420
 Dr. Peat, stay right there.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:53.420
 It's raypeat.com.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:57.700
 We're going to do a little break and then we're going to dig into your fascinating times

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.340
 we are living in, isn't it?

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:04.020
 Do a little break and then we'll get into your emails.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:10.020
 That is patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:16.380
 Well I think it's pretty fair to say that ongoing detoxification is a very good thing

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.580
 with pollution and such.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.100
 And we recommend that you think about that.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:28.980
 And one thing you can do is get yourself a relaxed far infrared sauna.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:34.660
 These are little portable units and your head sticks out so you don't heat up your head.

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:37.460
 And I really enjoy mine.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.500
 I use mine almost every day of my life.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:45.580
 And you have a couple of different settings where you could use at halfway or all the

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:46.580
 way.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.460
 And boy all the way you will sweat a lot.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.940
 Very interesting technology.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.700
 It's out of the medical university in Taiwan.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.580
 And they've won several awards.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:02.180
 If you're watching on video or you can just look on the front page you can see a picture

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.980
 of it.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:04.980
 No plumbing is needed.

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.700
 They are very low EMFs.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:12.020
 We just have some magnetic energy, some electrical energy which happens with all motors.

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.660
 These are very fine units.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.260
 I've had mine for gosh over ten years now.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:24.900
 And really I think it's really helped me to stay well for all these years and continue

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.420
 to get better and better.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:27.500
 Knock on wood.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.020
 It's the relaxed far infrared sauna.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:34.980
 The best way to get the best, the only way to get the best price is to email me.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.900
 And that's Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.260
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.900
 Tell me where you live and I'll give you the best price ever.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.820
 We'll ship them all over the world.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:49.940
 If you're in the lower 48 it's $1,150.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:55.780
 $1,150 and you're not going to find that price anywhere.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:02.180
 They don't even allow us to put that price in print.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.380
 It's just an oral kind of a deal we can do.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.340
 Just email me and I'll hook you up.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.380
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:13.820
 Previously with Dr. Mark Serkis who's written several books on hydrogen.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:18.380
 He talks here about how and why it works when we breathe in the hydrogen gas and bubble

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.740
 our water.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:25.900
 Hydrogen is the point between the physical universe and all the other dimensions, energetic

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.540
 dimensions.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:32.620
 The first thing that comes into existence in the physical plane is hydrogen, H1.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:39.100
 Hydrogen floods the space in between all the stars and galaxies and it gives the sun, it

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.900
 takes a bath of hydrogen 24/7.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:49.460
 It's constantly being infused with hydrogen which it burns in the body.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.540
 We have something similar going in plants.

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:58.460
 Plants take in light and carbon dioxide and they make food, chemical food, which is a

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:04.140
 process of adding hydrogen that when you eat it you strip it.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:10.780
 But you put hydrogen gas into a person, before it's an antioxidant it's like rocket fuel

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.700
 and it is rocket fuel.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:17.860
 So many good things are going on when you breathe this hydrogen from the AquaCure machine,

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:21.260
 that's the one Dr. Serkis uses, and bubble the water.

 It's Brandon Amelani, his organization.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.940
 Wonderful products, they're all in myron glass.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:23.380
 Things from ginseng to shaga, reishi, goji berries, schizandra, immune products, some

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.620
 minerals, really nice minerals.

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:31.980
 I just got some midnight minerals, you can take these before bed.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:37.380
 Some brown rice, brown rice product, very, very nice.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:42.100
 It's flakes, organic, incredibly easy to digest.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.060
 Some really good things with Shen Blossom.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.940

 We are listener supported, One Radio Network.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.660
 Well, it's the third Wednesday of the month.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.460
 Patrick Timpone with Ray Peat, RayPeat.com.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:07.180
 If you have some questions here, we have plenty already, but we have lots of time.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.140
 I think we can kind of get to them.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.580
 This is from Leroy.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:19.180
 Patrick's been talking about magnesium with Marley Robbins, one of the magnesium guys.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.700
 I wanted to get Dr. Peat's opinion.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.500
 I read all the time that we are very low on magnesium.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.180
 Does he agree that most of us are?

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:33.460
 And would he take magnesium just to take extra or test for it?

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.780
 I'd like his opinion, please.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:45.220
 About 50 years ago, I was finding that, for example, a woman with menstrual cramps, uterine

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:53.980
 cramps, could relieve the pain and the cramps in just 5 or 10 minutes after taking some

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.340
 magnesium carbonate.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:04.380
 And then I started seeing that many other symptoms could be relieved as quickly.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:13.660
 But it turned out that they had to keep taking it at least once a week, if not daily, to

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.420
 keep the symptoms away.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:24.860
 But then I read an interesting book about magnesium, a professor at the University of

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:35.620
 Colorado, I think it was, who explains that cells need good thyroid function to be able

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:44.660
 to retain magnesium because it exists in cells in combination with the ATP molecule.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:50.100
 And you need thyroid to make the ATP, which retains the magnesium.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:41:00.020
 If your thyroid is low, the cell ATP level goes down and magnesium is released, calcium

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:05.100
 goes into the cell, causing problems, cramps and so on.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:11.540
 And the increased magnesium in the blood gradually gets lost in the urine.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:14.780
 So then you have to keep replenishing it.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:24.180
 But if your thyroid and ATP level are good, then you retain the magnesium for a very long

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.180
 time.

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.260
 Very interesting.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:37.020
 So it could be tied back into low thyroid, all this "people are very low on magnesium",

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.620
 that could be the connection that they're just dumping it.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:48.020
 Yeah, inflammatory diseases, high histamine release, for example, you can cure it with

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:52.740
 magnesium all by itself if you keep putting it in.

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:58.300
 But they're the same symptoms that you get from low thyroid because low thyroid people

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.120
 can't retain their magnesium very well.

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:05.620
 So low thyroid people could be high in histamines.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:14.620
 Yeah, calcium goes into cells in excess, excites the cells and they make histamine and release

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:15.620
 it.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:20.460
 So that's what a histamine response is, is too much calcium in the cells.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:27.540
 Yeah, basically a fatigued cell that can't keep the calcium out.

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:37.340
 One of the first steps before dying is that the cell produces histamine and that starts

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.700
 poisoning the system if the cell isn't repaired.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:45.340
 So antihistamines would just be asymptomatic, Dr. Peat, where you don't want to get to the

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:49.940
 cause and you're saying it's most likely or could be low thyroid.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:59.780
 Yeah, and that applies to conditions like the corona sickness or virus and pollution

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.420
 sickness in general.

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:10.620
 Thyroid, magnesium and the histamines all are protective, all working in the same system

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.060
 and inflammatory.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.980
 This ties right in, it's great.

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:18.500
 And this one was up, it's serendipitous that this one was up there.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:26.020
 Miss Sally, Oklahoma, I did a thyroid panel, my TSH is around 4.5.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.980
 I hear that that's really higher than normal.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.420
 I really don't want to go to a doctor, I actually can't afford it.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.260
 I was wondering if Dr. Peat could give me some ideas.

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:40.340
 I have access to some natural thyroid from a friend.

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:47.380
 What dosage I could start at if I just wanted to do this myself?

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:55.900
 I think it's a good idea if you can get one of Broda Barnes' books, Hypothyroidism, the

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:59.580
 Unsuspected Illness, for example.

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:10.140
 He describes exactly how the natural thyroid works and how to go about dosing it in a very

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.180
 careful way.

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:20.300
 The only, very few people have been harmed by taking a big dose of thyroid.

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:25.820
 For example, if they had had a heart attack within the last week, they shouldn't jump

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:32.980
 right in with a big dose of thyroid because it makes your body need more oxygen and blood

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:36.380
 circulation puts an end on your heart.

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:43.900
 So if your heart is very weak, you have to start the thyroid very, very slowly.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:53.100
 But getting some background like that, then the natural thyroid, especially people who

00:44:53.100 --> 00:45:07.440
 live in fishery areas, seacoast towns, and farmers who were producing chickens or any

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:17.100
 meat animals, they would always include the thyroid gland in their soups and stews and

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:18.540
 so on.

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:25.500
 So historically, people eating a natural diet were always getting some of the natural

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:31.820
 thyroid gland mixed right into their soup or sausage or whatever meat dish they were

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:34.140
 eating.

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:43.020
 It was in the early 1940s that the Department of Agriculture said that the slaughterhouses

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:52.220
 may sell the thyroid gland only to the drug manufacturing companies to produce pills for

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:58.420
 medicine, but the common person can't buy it to eat.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:06.060
 So since then, hypothyroidism has become an epidemic throughout the industrialized world.

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.780
 In that regard then, do you think there could be some benefit?

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:16.500
 There are several products out there, Doc, where you can get some desiccated beef thyroid

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:21.300
 from grass-fed cows from Australia or New Zealand.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:25.260
 Could that help boost thyroid safely since it's a food of some kind?

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:31.900
 Yeah, if you're sure the slaughterhouse got the right gland.

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:34.900
 Sometimes they get lymph nodes and things by mistake.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.900
 Good luck with that, right?

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:44.820
 So the potency is extremely variable, and so that's why Brodebarn's method is so important.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:51.860
 You should take a given amount, say 30 milligrams, and do that every day for two weeks while

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:58.900
 watching for any change in your temperature and pulse rate.

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:06.100
 You should have in mind goal temperature like waking up around 98 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.340
 At least 98.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:14.420
 With a pulse of high 60s per minute maybe.

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:27.580
 And if that's your goal, then if your starting temperature is 96.5 and your pulse rate is

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:36.740
 50, for example, then make marks on a paper.

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:44.380
 If the dose is just what you need, then it will climb steadily for two weeks roughly

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.580
 and then level off.

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:54.540
 But if you don't see any change after a week or two, that means the dose is much too small.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:48:02.540
 So then you can go to 60 milligrams, but stay on that, watching every day for changes for

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.340
 another two weeks at least.

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:09.580
 So the key then is the pulse and the temperature first thing in the morning.

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:14.640
 And then I guess 60 milligrams is what they call a grain, which most of them come.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.620
 So you could cut that in half, right?

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.620
 And then start for a couple weeks and you should see it rise.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:26.100
 But once you get to 98, would you just be, if you're at 98 when you wake up now, would

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.100
 that mean?

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:36.540
 Then right after breakfast it should go up to about 98.6 and stay in that zone until

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:37.540
 sunset.

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:42.900
 Then when the sun goes down, it's normal for it to decrease again for the night.

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:43.940
 I see.

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:49.660
 So if it doesn't go up to 98.6, then you still could maybe use a little.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.300
 Yeah, in general.

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:59.740
 And your daytime pulse, it's fine to be anywhere in the 80s at rest during the daytime.

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:00.740
 Wow.

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:01.740
 Wow.

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:03.540
 Okay, so this is Berta Barnes' book.

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.540
 What's the name of it?

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:09.860
 Hypothyroidism, the Unsuspected Illness.

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:11.420
 The Unsuspected Illness.

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:13.660
 And that really lays it out.

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:18.820
 Another book is Solved, the Riddle of Heart Attacks.

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:27.620
 He gave almost all of his patients the thyroid that he thought they needed.

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:35.020
 And in his whole career, he never had a patient die of heart disease.

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:43.660
 He said statistically there should have been several hundred of them, but that's why he

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.740
 called it Solved, the Riddle of Heart Attacks.

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:52.460
 Just by getting their TSH and their body temperature, everything in balance.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:59.940
 Yeah, the higher the TSH is, the more inflamed your circulatory system is.

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:03.740
 It throws your immune system out of whack.

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:13.780
 And the lower your TSH is, the happier your immune and circulatory systems are.

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:20.460
 And in this emailer's case, so a four and a half is a little bit high?

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:28.020
 Oh, I've never seen a very healthy person whose TSH was even two or above.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.020
 Really?

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:30.020
 Wow.

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:35.980
 Everyone I've seen with 4.5 has pretty intense symptoms.

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:42.140
 So then she could start easily at 30 and then work her way up, like you just talked her

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:43.140
 through, right?

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.140
 Yeah.

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:45.140
 Pretty safely?

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.140
 Yep, yep, yep.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:47.140
 Okay.

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:48.140
 Here's one for you.

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:55.700
 In past interviews, Dr. Peters mentioned that inflammation was previously seen as a necessary

00:50:55.700 --> 00:51:01.340
 part of the healing process, but now it's recognized as a cause of heart disease, diabetes,

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.860
 cancer, muscle wasting, and aging.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:11.940
 What can a person eat or supplement to successfully shut down this aggressive level of inflammation

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:19.420
 once it has settled in a chronic state within the body and reverse any damage it contributed

00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:23.300
 to?

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:31.820
 Shifting your diet, there are many things in the average diet contributing to that.

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:37.860
 And even living at sea level is one of the factors.

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:44.860
 There have been interesting studies in highly polluted Mexico City.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:48.580
 Kids who grow up there don't have any asthma.

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:54.220
 If they go down to sea level, they often suffer from asthma.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:52:01.100
 And several things about high altitude are protective against inflammation.

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:10.220
 Particularly the lower oxygen pressure because too much oxygen creates inflammation as demonstrated

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:16.260
 by the intubated corona patients.

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.300
 Here's another one for you.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:23.100
 Can eating beef liver several times a week lead to a problematic excess of iron in the

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:24.100
 body?

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:25.100
 Oh, yeah.

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:31.980
 I think liver should be limited to about one serving per week.

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:41.860
 Too much meat, people who eat a pound of meat every day are going to overload not only on

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:54.100
 the pro-inflammatory iron, but also the pro-inflammatory tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine that

00:52:54.100 --> 00:53:00.500
 are very high in the meat, and the extremely high ratio of phosphate to calcium in the

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:01.500
 meat.

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:08.900
 All of these are pro-inflammatory that are able to accelerate the aging inflammatory

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:09.900
 process.

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:16.500
 But isn't tryptophan more to settle people down to help them sleep and they even do IVs

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:20.740
 for tryptophan?

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:27.260
 They might do it, but I think it's very dangerous.

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:35.540
 Cysteine and tryptophan are very closely connected to the inflammatory processes, including brain

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:36.540
 inflammation.

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.540
 Okay.

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:43.660
 So you don't want to do that to go to sleep, right?

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:44.860
 No.

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:46.140
 This is Ben from Oregon.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.580
 Hi, Dr. Peat.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:53.580
 I'm currently on two grains of natrithroid, which just recently has been pulled from the

00:53:53.580 --> 00:54:00.940
 shelves, yet again would like to start taking Sinoplus like you do.

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:11.300
 How many Sinoplus 120, 30 microgram tablets would equal two grains of natrithroid?

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:26.180
 One tablet is stronger than a two-grain tablet of Armour or one of the standard glandulars.

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:36.380
 It's equivalent to about 2.2 or 3/10 of a grain per Sinoplus.

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:39.540
 So the Sinoplus is just the three.

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:40.540
 Is that correct if I remember?

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:41.540
 T3?

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:47.820
 No, it's T4, four parts to one part of T3.

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:48.820
 Okay.

00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:53.820
 And that equals to a full...

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:54.820
 More than two grains.

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:55.820
 Two grains.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:58.820
 That's 120 milligrams of natrithroid.

00:54:58.820 --> 00:54:59.820
 Wow.

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:00.820
 Right.

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.820
 About 130 or 140.

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:04.820
 Yeah.

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:08.420
 So you wouldn't want to use the Sinoplus if you're just starting, right?

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:09.420
 Yeah.

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:16.140
 I would start on a fourth of a tablet, which is roughly like a half a grain.

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:25.420
 Do I need a US script or can I get this in the Medicina Mexico site?

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:31.220
 Yeah, the Mexican pharmacies managed to get it through the mail.

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:35.980
 Yeah, you can get the Sinoplus there, right?

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:38.660
 Here's a question for Dr. Peat from Ina.

00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:43.500
 When I have a sweet fruit like watermelon or honey on an empty stomach, after five or

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:48.020
 10 minutes, I get a dull pain around the liver area and feel cold.

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:52.140
 I have a little fruit after food and I don't have this problem.

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:58.460
 Does this suggest I have a problem with fructose and should avoid fruits or can this be related

00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:04.580
 to estrogen as my mom seems to have similar symptoms?

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.620
 A lot of possibilities.

00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:14.780
 It could be a slight inflammation reaction.

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:22.500
 There are many potential allergens in a variety of fruits and honeys.

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:25.660
 But it just could be a little tricky to figure that out.

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:26.660
 Yeah.

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:30.700
 That's the only thing, yeah.

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:46.420
 From George in Oceanside, I use Whey Plus olive oil for H, oh, human alpha-lactoblomide

00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:54.980
 lethal to tumor cells and lecithin as a source of phosphatidylcholine to help the liver.

00:56:54.980 --> 00:57:00.540
 What does Dr. Peat think about these supplements?

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:13.780
 I use Whey Plus olive oil for H, which he says is human alpha-lactoblomide lethal to

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:14.780
 tumor cells.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:16.780
 Oh, made lethal to tumor cells.

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.460
 He's using it to get rid of tumors.

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:25.020
 I don't think it sounds plausible.

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:34.740
 Whey contains some of those amino acids that can actually support tumor growth, tryptophan

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:37.580
 and cysteine for example.

00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:39.060
 Okay.

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:42.540
 I listen to Dr. Peat every month.

00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:43.540
 Thank you for having him on.

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.980
 This is from Robert from Australia.

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:53.260
 I tried some of his suggestions, started drinking some milk and freshly squeezed orange juice.

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:58.460
 Now after a few weeks of doing this, I have developed a strange reaction of having a headache

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:02.900
 and strange noise in my head while also feeling kind of dizzy.

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:07.180
 This reaction happens after I drink just a half a glass of milk or orange juice.

00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:13.740
 My experience is the same after I eat bone broth and after taking aspirin as well.

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:21.140
 Did a bit of research and think that my problem is probably related to histamine intolerance.

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:27.260
 Could you ask Dr. Peat what he would suggest and how he thinks I can overcome this problem?

00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:32.700
 It depends a lot on what the rest of the diet is.

00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:44.300
 Sometimes bacteria can invade the small intestine or even the stomach and start producing endotoxin

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:55.140
 and other irritants very soon after you take in some carbohydrate.

00:58:55.140 --> 00:59:05.540
 Something to stimulate the intestinal peristalsis like a raw carrot or something like a cup

00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:18.260
 full of cooked mushrooms every day to stimulate the intestine will help to stop the bacterial

00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:19.260
 toxin production.

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:21.420
 You have mentioned that before.

00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:27.980
 I'm curious how cooked mushrooms help the intestines.

00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:36.940
 Mushrooms have lots of anti-inflammatory things and quite a few antibacterial substances because

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:45.780
 they live in a bacteria loaded environment in decaying matter.

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:49.900
 They naturally produce chemicals that suppress bacterial growth.

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:51.860
 But we want to cook these guys, right?

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:53.900
 You don't want to eat them raw.

00:59:53.900 --> 01:00:03.780
 Because all mushrooms contain some heat, degradable carcinogenic substances.

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:10.780
 So if you boil them for at least an hour, you'll break down the carcinogenic factors

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:19.340
 and what remains is germicidal and anti-inflammatory and bulk providing.

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:24.940
 Dr. Ray Peat is here on the third Monday of the month.

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:27.820
 It's September 21st.

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:29.460
 Today here's one for you.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.940
 Dr. Peat, I'm taking three grains.

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:33.100
 Wow, three grains.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:36.860
 I guess that would be, is that 180 milligrams?

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.860
 Three grains of thyroid extract.

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:41.900
 My temperature has risen to optimum levels.

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:49.820
 However, at the same time, my resting heart rate is about 90, 100 beats per minute, which

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.860
 feels pretty high for me.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:57.220
 Yes, sometimes that happens to me.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:02.620
 In the summer, for example, we are much more sensitive to thyroid.

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:12.260
 So I will sometimes on a dose that was just right in the spring, by mid-summer, I'll start

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:21.180
 overheating at 120 pulse rate just with like raking leaves or something.

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:27.860
 So I cut back my dose greatly during the summer.

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:34.100
 Medical studies show that it's normal to need about four times as much thyroid in the winter

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.500
 as in the summer.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:36.500
 My goodness.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:42.060
 So you always have to be alert to what season it is and what you're eating and how much

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:47.980
 stress you're under and adjust the dose so that you're comfortable.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:56.100
 So if someone is uncomfortable with a higher pulse rate, even something like 80, you'd

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:59.140
 want to back off if you just don't feel right with it.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:07.700
 Yeah, you're likely to get out of breath easily if your pulse is running 100 at rest.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:14.420
 And moderate activity might make it go up to 125.

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:22.540
 So if that makes you uncomfortable, then it's good to back off until the season changes

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:27.420
 or you have other reasons for needing more.

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:28.420
 Okay.

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:33.460
 Patrick at OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:41.460
 Please ask Dr. Peat if I can take 25 milligrams of Losartan and 100 milligrams of aspirin

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:48.580
 four to five times a week for inflammation control and also to protect against COVID,

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:50.740
 older age female.

01:02:50.740 --> 01:03:06.700
 Oh, the standard package dose for Losartan, the recommended dose, I found was much more

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:09.460
 than needed.

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:17.420
 My blood pressure would go down with about a fourth of the standard dose.

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:25.580
 So each person I think should watch for signs such as blood pressure and any other indicator

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:31.700
 of inflammation and adjust the dose accordingly.

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:39.940
 Someone wants to know about your opinion on essential oils internally and externally.

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:43.540
 Basically they're good smelling.

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:54.180
 Some of them are anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, very helpful.

01:03:54.180 --> 01:04:03.860
 Eucalyptus oil, camphor, some of them are used as antivirals and each one has its unique

01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:04.860
 properties.

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:10.820
 So I don't think you can generalize about them.

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:17.140
 What is Dr. Peat's opinion on autophagy, A-U-T-O-P-H-A-G-Y?

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.140
 What is that?

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:33.580
 It's a new term for activating the lysozymes, internal revision breakdown proteins.

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:45.860
 When a protein is damaged, it will get put into the lysosome and enzymes will be degraded

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:51.340
 into amino acids and it will go back as a nutrient.

01:04:51.340 --> 01:05:02.860
 So it's a process that goes on steadily but when it happens drastically and you get a

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:14.940
 sudden breakdown of the substance of the cell, that can be preparation either for destroying

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:21.420
 cancer cells or for destroying normal cells and letting them turn into cancer cells.

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:31.820
 So it has become kind of a fad but it's just part of the normal cell turnover process,

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:32.820
 internal revision.

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:46.060
 I think it's best not to take any drugs that are known to intensify the process because

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:51.180
 some of them also promote tumor survival instead of destruction.

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:56.380
 We're very fortunate to have Dr. Peat on once a month and he doesn't do medical advice

01:05:56.380 --> 01:06:02.780
 and stuff but he can give you his opinion on things and if you'd like to join in, Patrick

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:05.260
 at OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.100
 This is from Harish.

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:13.540
 Could you please ask Dr. Peat, you mentioned in one of your interviews that you cannot

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:21.540
 take sufficient thyroid when you had been in Florida because of the high heat and humidity.

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:26.420
 Does that mean that people living in tropical countries will not be able to take enough

01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:32.740
 thyroid to fully fix their hypothyroid symptoms?

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:42.140
 Should people move to the tropics and move to Florida because the external heat will

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:44.340
 keep their body temperature up?

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:53.340
 A person who is in a northern climate might go around with a 95 degree Fahrenheit body

01:06:53.340 --> 01:07:03.260
 temperature and be sick if they move into a steamy tropical place where the air is humid

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:14.620
 and 90 degrees, their body will find it easy to get their oral temperature up to the 97.5

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:19.100
 or even 98 degrees where everything works better.

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:25.420
 So for a hypothyroid person, tropical climate is therapeutic.

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:30.140
 It gets their body temperature up and lowers stress.

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:35.380
 Do you think these guys, these little infrared things you can do on your forehead for temperature

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.420
 are accurate?

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.420
 Do we know?

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:50.060
 They seem to have some correspondence to the internal temperature but a lot of things can

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:56.420
 happen right in the skin of your forehead.

01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:07.180
 I wouldn't consider it a very precise way of measuring your temperature.

01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:12.500
 A body temperature change of two degrees will probably show up on your forehead.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:15.220
 Wow, well that's a lot.

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:19.620
 So the only way to get it would be just a good old-fashioned, if you can find them,

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:24.300
 they're hard to find, but a good old-fashioned mercury thermometer and pop it in your mouth.

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.860
 Yeah, those are extremely reliable.

01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:30.340
 They're a perfect standard.

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:34.940
 Eardrum temperature is another extremely variable thing.

01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:42.380
 I've found that just the kind of mental activity I'm doing, my right and left ears

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:44.140
 can vary by a degree.

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.140
 Oh my goodness.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:50.980
 And you know, as I said, you can find the mercury thermometers but again, they're challenging

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:53.420
 to find them but there's a few of them still out there.

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:55.460
 I think you have to know somebody.

01:08:55.460 --> 01:09:02.620
 Dr. Peat, I have a surgery soon and wonder how I can protect my body from the stress

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:06.620
 associated with anesthesia and surgery itself.

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:12.100
 Also, I've heard common side effects is a hair loss and would like to avoid that.

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.100
 This is from Alex.

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:15.740
 Oh, surgery.

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:22.860
 All of the anti-inflammatory things but a very important thing that several studies

01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:30.180
 have validated but most hospitals haven't taken it up yet is to make sure your intestine

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:41.660
 is clean, a good laxative for two or three days before the surgery or even eating several

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:52.060
 carrots a day for about three or four days before the surgery because they found that,

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:58.820
 for example, giving an antibiotic for a day or two before the surgery to totally disinfect

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:09.460
 the bowel, that people come out of surgery quickly, recover, everything recovers faster

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:17.860
 and they don't have the incidence of prolonged inflammatory problems after the surgery.

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:18.860
 Interesting.

01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:22.820
 Just a tremendous difference for disinfecting the bowel.

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:28.060
 Many people argue that if we have one course of antibiotics that it kind of messes up the

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:31.780
 microbiome and we have to get things back.

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:36.900
 Does it, one course of antibiotics?

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:42.900
 What the doctors define as a course of antibiotics or the package insert, it wants you to take

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:43.900
 the whole package.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:46.540
 Fourteen days or?

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:47.540
 Yeah.

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:51.980
 That very often is a severe overdose.

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:59.860
 It can wipe out so many that what comes back might not be predictable.

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:13.740
 So I think if you have the option to take enough the first day or two to stop the symptoms,

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:20.140
 get them under control and as soon as the symptoms have disappeared, maybe give it another

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:32.420
 day but then taper off and probably the pathogen will disappear and you can taper off and not

01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:38.020
 totally eliminate all of your bacteria so that you recover faster.

01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:43.260
 Dr. Ray P, what would, in your opinion, would be some of the very best things that people,

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:47.700
 most people have taken antibiotics to get this microbiome thing happy again?

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.060
 What are some things your favorites to do that?

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.060
 Carrots.

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:55.060
 Carrots, we're all carrots.

01:11:55.060 --> 01:12:02.620
 They have mild antibiotic functions but they don't destroy everything.

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:05.820
 Not the juice but the grating carrots, right?

01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:12.500
 Yeah, the juice is counterproductive because of the very high keratin content which is

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.100
 anti-thyroid.

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:17.580
 So that's kind of part of your, what's that little carrot salad you do?

01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:21.980
 I think you do the grated carrots with, what's on the top there?

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:25.060
 A little olive oil and vinegar and salt.

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:28.820
 Yeah, and that really will help get everybody happy again.

01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:30.700
 You can do this every night, right?

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:38.540
 Yeah, the olive oil and vinegar are both able to suppress bacteria and fungal growth.

01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:44.060
 And then eventually, are we speaking of the colon now or for this, this is what's going

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.060
 on in the colon?

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:49.460
 Yeah, the colon isn't the whole story.

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:56.460
 Americans now on average have considerable bacterial growth in their small intestine

01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.620
 where it shouldn't be.

01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:07.340
 And the healthier a person is, the farther towards the colon the bacteria are.

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:16.060
 A very healthy person has a sterile small intestine and a person with deteriorating

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:21.580
 health will sometimes have bacteria all the way up to their stomach.

01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:22.580
 Not good.

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:26.860
 So this is commonly called what's SIBO, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:29.500
 Have you noticed some things that people can do for this?

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:39.540
 Yeah, the carrots and cooked mushrooms will gradually disinfect the small intestine and

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:48.460
 making sure your thyroid is good because the secretions, stomach acid and pancreatic enzymes,

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:55.380
 all of those are in proportion to your metabolic rate and thyroid function.

01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:03.140
 And so if those are underproduced, bacteria aren't properly killed.

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:10.780
 And so thyroid getting your digestion going speeds the movement through the intestine,

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:13.500
 washes out bacteria before they can replicate.

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:14.900
 Oh, excellent.

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:20.780
 Well, that's some pretty nice natural ways for this, carrots and mushrooms.

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:24.660
 I mean, that's great, right, without having to take a bunch of pills?

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:25.660
 Yeah.

01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:26.660
 Looking for...

01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:37.700
 I've seen just carrots for a few days solve problems like reproductive hormone imbalance,

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:45.660
 lower the blood cholesterol, lower the estrogen to progesterone ratio, increasing progesterone.

01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:46.660
 Interesting.

01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:51.380
 And this could be, this carrot salad, even a couple times a day or...

01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:52.980
 It's fine?

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:59.940
 Yeah, and an extreme person might eat three carrots a day, but usually one middle-sized

01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:02.260
 carrot is enough every day.

01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:06.980
 That's a grated up olive oil, a little vinegar and some salt.

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:07.980
 That's great.

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:11.900
 Mark writes in, "My wife is constantly trying to clear her throat all day long.

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:16.820
 She likens it to phlegm and can never get it cleared.

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:18.940
 Silent reflux has been ruled out.

01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:21.860
 An allergist gave her medication.

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:27.060
 She thinks, 'Oh, she inhales through the nose,' but that hasn't helped, and she takes no other

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:28.060
 medication.

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:33.540
 I'm wondering what we could try to do now."

01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:44.420
 There are reflexes so that irritation somewhere else can cause excess mucus production in

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:54.780
 the nose or sinus area or throat, and so making sure that the intestine isn't being irritated.

01:15:54.780 --> 01:16:07.460
 Sometimes just finding a spice, pepper, for example, or celery or many particular foods

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:14.820
 can cause chronic irritation in the intestine with the reflex, excess mucus production up

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:17.700
 in the upper respiratory system.

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:21.620
 Dr. Ray Peat, we have time for a few more here.

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:24.780
 We could probably squeeze you in if you haven't emailed yet.

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:26.820
 Patrick on Radionetwork.com.

01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:28.860
 This is from Michael, Dr. Peat.

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:29.860
 He's in Connecticut.

01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:39.460
 "Are there any nutritional or hormonal approach to help reduce prostate enlargement, BPH?"

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:42.540
 Oh, cool.

01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:44.220
 Okay.

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:47.300
 Yeah, balancing the hormones.

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:56.820
 Thyroid deficiency is going to necessarily weaken your control and balancing processes.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:04.580
 Your liver slows down and lets testosterone turn into estrogen.

01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:15.060
 Estrogen activates inflammatory and cell multiplication processes.

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:23.900
 Men with the highest testosterone level generally have the lowest estrogen and the lowest prostate

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:26.780
 cancer problems.

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:37.300
 Deficiency of testosterone usually is the result of low thyroid leading to the conversion

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:44.660
 of testosterone to estrogen and estrogen promotes growth of the prostate and inflammation.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:49.540
 So it's good to check your hormones.

01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:53.900
 Vitamin D is a major anti-inflammatory factor.

01:17:53.900 --> 01:18:03.420
 Might be the single most important thing besides thyroid function, good vitamin D level.

01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:11.820
 If folks get a vitamin D test, blood test, and it's high but they're not doing any extra

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:16.660
 vitamin D but they do get out in the sun, is that a pretty good go?

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:18.100
 You don't need to do extra?

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:22.620
 Yep, the sunlight is the best way to get it.

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:26.940
 Keeping your calcium intake high relative to phosphate.

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:32.980
 Oh, so if you eat a lot of meat, try to get some good kind of calcium in there.

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:33.980
 Yeah.

01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:36.220
 Here's a good one for you.

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:45.780
 What seasonal foods is Dr. Peat looking forward to for this fall?

01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:47.420
 It's hard to tell.

01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:54.780
 I believe fall is a good season for fruits like sapotes and cherimoyas.

01:18:54.780 --> 01:19:00.780
 Those are showing up in the supermarkets now fairly regularly and if you can find them

01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:06.460
 properly ripened, they are good seasonal.

01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:13.660
 I think they're grown now both in Florida and the Santa Barbara area.

01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:20.620
 This is from James, "My wife started taking your Progest-E, had such a positive effect

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:21.620
 on her.

01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:30.380
 I decided due to me being under work stress to take the Progest-E. I take one drop daily

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:31.940
 rubbed on my gums.

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:34.540
 I've just started taking it for only 11 days.

01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:41.600
 I've noticed within minutes of taking Progest-E, I seem to sweat for about 15 minutes after

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.660
 taking the supplements and then I'm just fine.

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:46.660
 Why would this be happening?

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:53.780
 Does it mean that more or less of an adjustment is needed?"

01:19:53.780 --> 01:20:00.380
 Progesterone does tend to increase your temperature and it can activate your sweat glands if they've

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:06.220
 been blocked by stress hormones.

01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:07.220
 What's Progest-E?

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:08.220
 Progesterone.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.220
 Progesterone-E. Sorry.

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:23.060
 In itself, progesterone has these anti-stress effects that dry skin, for example, the sweat

01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:28.420
 glands are shut down by too much estrogen.

01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:31.980
 This is a product that you developed, Progesterone-E?

01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:32.980
 Progest-E complex, yeah.

01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:36.580
 That's the name of the one I developed.

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:38.980
 Do you sell that or who sells that?

01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:42.860
 Ketogen makes it and sells it.

01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:43.860
 Ketogen?

01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:44.860
 Yeah.

01:20:44.860 --> 01:21:01.740
 Ketogen.com, their phone number is 541-345-9855.

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:05.060
 And you're spelling it K-E-T-O, Ketogen?

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:06.060
 K-E-N-O-GEN.

01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:07.060
 Ketogen.

01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:08.060
 Ketogen.

01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:09.060
 Ketogen.

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:19.020
 And what's, is the progesterone-E, is that a kind of a bioidentical yam thing?

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:28.140
 It's similar to the one made from yams, but it's actually identical to the hormone we

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:29.140
 make.

01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:34.260
 Oh, so you think it's a more efficient way to get some progesterone.

01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:35.420
 Yeah.

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:43.660
 I, the first time I used it was around 1973 or '74.

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:47.140
 I'd been working with it in animals.

01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:56.860
 I had a horrible migraine, blind spots and sickness, and I put about 50 milligrams or

01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:59.860
 more in my mouth.

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:07.820
 Before I could get back to my morning in bed, the headache was gone, and I got in bed and

01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:08.820
 went to sleep.

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:15.940
 I tried it again and waited until I could lie down and close my eyes before I put it

01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:23.900
 in my mouth, and then watched what happened to the visual flashing lights and such.

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:32.460
 And within about five seconds of getting it in my mouth, a quiet black area in my visual

01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:39.420
 field appeared and steadily expanded over about just a minute.

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:46.940
 And as that quiet black area expanded, turning off the flashing lights, the headache and

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:49.380
 the nausea subsided.

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:59.420
 And as my visual field was clear, there was still a progressing sense of euphoria coming

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:00.740
 on.

01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:08.100
 And just about two minutes after I put it in my mouth, everything was peaceful.

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:10.500
 I felt perfect and went to sleep.

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:11.940
 Very interesting.

01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:25.460
 What would be symptomatics of folks calling for this product to take the Progest-E?

01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:26.460
 What was the question?

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:31.020
 What would be some symptoms that people might say, "Well, maybe I'll try this and see if

01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:32.020
 it helps me."

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:41.740
 Oh, the PMS and menopause symptoms are the usual reasons people take it.

01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:53.340
 Katherine Adalton worked for many years with women with PMS and toxemia of pregnancy problems.

01:23:53.340 --> 01:24:05.340
 And all of her patients not only immediately recovered from the very debilitating premenstrual

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:11.900
 symptoms and menopausal symptoms, but they stopped having toxemic pregnancies.

01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:19.060
 And it turned out that their babies had about 30 points higher IQ than their older siblings

01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:22.780
 that were born before they got progesterone.

01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:28.900
 And what would be some symptoms that might lead a male to trying this product as this

01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:30.620
 fellow did?

01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:44.700
 I've used it on some of my friends with rheumatoid arthritis and migraines like myself.

01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:48.540
 Those are the most spectacular effects.

01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:57.100
 A friend of mine worked at a bench and every afternoon his knee swelled up horribly.

01:24:57.100 --> 01:25:01.100
 It looked like a pink football.

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:07.940
 And I went to the drugstore and got him a bottle of injectable progesterone, but he

01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:12.260
 rubbed the whole bottle on his leg.

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:21.020
 And not only the painful pink football effect disappeared, but I saw him repeatedly over

01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:26.220
 the next 30 years and he never had a recurrence of arthritis.

01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:34.620
 And another time a plumber was limping.

01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:44.620
 One knee, he said, the cartilage was destroyed and the surgeon said it needed a joint replacement,

01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:49.740
 but he planned to retire instead.

01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:54.220
 But I gave him a bottle of progesterone, Progest-E.

01:25:54.220 --> 01:26:01.740
 He covered his whole leg with it and before he finished the job, he was walking with less

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.700
 of a limp.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:06.940
 And I told him to apply it again.

01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:13.580
 And the next day, the job had been finished, but next day he was there knocking on the

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:16.460
 door and said, "I just wanted to show you this."

01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:19.660
 And he ran down the steps and ran back up.

01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:27.540
 So this knee had no signs whatsoever of a problem.

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:31.660
 And I saw him 10 or 15 years later, he was still working as a plumber.

01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:35.340
 We have a fellow on from time to time that he's a weightlifter kind of strongman guy

01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:42.740
 and he had suggested, I know for sure, that a little bit of progesterone for guys helps

01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:45.100
 to raise testosterone level.

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:46.660
 Is that true?

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:53.700
 If you're under heavy stress, have some problems that is causing your testosterone to turn

01:26:53.700 --> 01:27:03.780
 to estrogen, then the progesterone in a moderate amount can block that process and let you

01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:09.740
 make and retain your testosterone by suppressing the estrogen.

01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:17.300
 Do you think that just generally evolutionary wise that as folks get more and more years

01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:20.020
 on them that the T levels tend to go down?

01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:23.140
 Oh sure, that's been known for a long time.

01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:26.420
 It's this kind of planet Earth thing with the body?

01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:33.140
 Yeah, both progesterone and testosterone decrease with age, leaving estrogen and cortisol as

01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:40.060
 the default hormones that degrade the tissues in various ways.

01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:44.740
 Speaking of cortisol, here's one from a fellow in Germany.

01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:48.060
 Sorry sir, I can't pronounce your name, but welcome.

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:54.620
 What are the causes for hyperventilation, low thyroid and high cortisol?

01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:59.500
 I guess he's got those all together.

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:08.340
 In a chemical sense, hyperventilation means that your CO2 is not being retained adequately.

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:15.780
 You have a low level of carbon dioxide in your tissues and that turns on the production

01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:23.260
 of lactic acid, which turns on the stress hormones.

01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:29.820
 That's called a natural adaptation to low thyroid.

01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:37.460
 The low thyroid means that you are not producing carbon dioxide at a high enough rate.

01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:47.020
 Even if you don't seem to be hyperventilating and are not breathing much at all because

01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:55.460
 you don't need much oxygen, a hypothyroid person always has elevated lactic acid in

01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:58.700
 relation to CO2 in the body.

01:28:58.700 --> 01:28:59.700
 Interesting.

01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:00.700
 Wow.

01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:02.700
 Wow, wow, wow.

01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:06.540
 Let me do this first.

01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:12.340
 Does Dr. Peat have any advice for an ongoing seborrheic dermatitis?

01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:17.500
 I'm worried that it's kind of an autoimmune response from old vaccines.

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:23.460
 I would be interested to know what Dr. Peat thinks about homeopathic medicine as well

01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:25.620
 in general.

01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:33.820
 I haven't had any experience with homeopathics for that, but vitamin D and the calcium phosphate

01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:39.860
 ratio in the diet are, I think, the first things that should be explored.

01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:45.300
 Vitamin D has many effects on the skin.

01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:53.380
 Psoriasis, sunburn, all kinds of things are improved by getting your vitamin D level up.

01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:54.380
 Good morning.

01:29:54.380 --> 01:30:02.420
 Would you please ask Dr. Peat what his thoughts are on this natural thyroid pills all being

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:03.980
 recalled?

01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:09.140
 How are those people without thyroids, how are we going to make it?

01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.940
 Oh, yeah.

01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:21.780
 I think some of the slaughterhouses were slipping in other glandular tissues and diluting the

01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:25.740
 actual thyroid substance.

01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:32.380
 Some of the products were extremely weak, like a fifth of what the label said, which

01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:40.100
 is only possible if other non-thyroid material got into the bat.

01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:47.180
 Normal pig or cow population varies in their own thyroid function.

01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:55.340
 So even with the purest glandular selection at the slaughterhouse, there will be variation.

01:30:55.340 --> 01:31:05.940
 So each bat should be tested carefully, but the FDA hasn't been interested in proper regulation

01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:13.140
 of the glandular products, neither the USP organization.

01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:21.660
 I found out 50 years ago that all they looked at was the iodine content, and so many companies

01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:30.300
 were getting away selling any old protein like gelatin or powdered milk with iodine

01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:39.660
 added, calling it natural desiccated thyroid, because the USP required testing only for

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:44.980
 iodine, which really can be an anti-thyroid factor.

01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:45.980
 Fascinating.

01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:48.420
 A couple more here.

01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:56.460
 Is there anything that can be done to help with bacterial mold fungus in the nasal passages

01:31:56.460 --> 01:32:11.700
 without fear of sending something to the brain?

01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:16.140
 There are non-toxic remedies.

01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:22.020
 I think the first thing is to make sure your immune system is good.

01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:30.820
 Having blood tests for thyroid and vitamin D and cortisol and so on, make sure your immune

01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:33.340
 system is okay.

01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:41.540
 And then consider some of the natural topical treatments, and it depends on exactly where

01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:46.380
 the fungus is.

01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:49.500
 Okay.

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.500
 Here's a great one.

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:52.100
 We'll end with this one here.

01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:56.020
 This is fun.

01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:58.140
 Could you please ask these questions to Dr. Peat?

01:32:58.140 --> 01:32:59.140
 All right, sir.

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:02.100
 You have three of them here, and then we'll let you go.

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:09.100
 The first one is, what does Dr. Peat think happens after death?

01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:27.860
 Basically, there are many interesting books and experiments that have been written.

01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:40.740
 A physicist professor in Texas wrote a book on the new paradigm, and he summarizes lots

01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:46.780
 of research on the subject.

01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:59.580
 Some other interpretations, Michael Persinger, for example, has the idea of consciousness

01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:12.540
 interacting with, resonating with, and having echoes in the planetary resonance.

01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:15.780
 No More Secrets is the title of one of his videos.

01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:24.620
 It's very interesting, and it overlaps with this book on the new paradigm.

01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:30.300
 A lot of interesting theories of exactly what might happen.

01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:31.300
 Sure.

01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.260
 Yeah, lots of research on that.

01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:41.180
 And his second question is, would you ever consider playing the cello on the show?

01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:42.180
 No.

01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:43.180
 No?

01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:44.180
 Okay.

01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:45.180
 Well, that was easy.

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:51.740
 And is there a sport that you enjoy either playing yourself or watching?

01:34:51.740 --> 01:35:04.420
 Oh, I haven't for a long time done anything called a sport, but I always enjoyed ping-pong

01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:05.420
 and tennis.

01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:12.700
 Those are the only sport-like activities I've enjoyed very much.

01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:15.900
 Well, Dr. Peat, as always, it's such an honor to talk to you.

01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:20.820
 You're one of our favorites, because so many people like listening to you around the world.

01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:22.580
 Thanks for being here.

01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:30.540
 If you would like to get Dr. Peat's newsletter, it's raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:40.700
 And he'll set you up, and you can also go to his website, raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com,

01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:44.540
 and read a lot of different articles and learn more about him.

01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:49.780
 So I hope the sky's clear up there, sir, and we'll be talking to you, I guess, in around

01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:50.780
 30 days or so.

01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:51.780
 Okay, very good.

01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:52.780
 Thank you.

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:53.780
 Thank you, sir.

01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:54.780
 It's an honor.

01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:55.780
 Thank you.

01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:58.780
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone, onradionetwork.com.

01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:02.340
 It's always fun having Dr. Peat on.

01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:07.300
 So I guess we're just going to blow out of here and have a little lunch ourselves.

01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:09.900
 I think I'm going to start doing those carrot things.

01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:11.540
 What do you think?

01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:15.040
 I did it for a while, and then all of a sudden, yeah.

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:20.020
 So that's just a grate of carrot every day with a little bit of vinegar, olive oil, a

01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:21.620
 little bit of salt.

01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:27.460
 And Dr. Peat says that that'll help you to get your whole, the bacteria thing all in

01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:29.940
 line, and we know that's so important.

01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:35.340
 And then the cooked mushrooms, I've been doing that with Dr. Peat's recommendations, and

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:37.340
 my body sure likes those.

01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:38.780
 So you might try that.

01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:39.780
 All different kinds of mushrooms.

01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:41.260
 Just make sure you cook them up.

01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:45.500
 You can do them in ghee and then little spices and stuff like that.

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.780
 All right, kids, well, I love you very much.

01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:52.940
 Thanks for your time and for being here.

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:57.420
 Again, as soon as I start really sleeping, I mean, I'll just be a force to reckon with.

01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:01.820
 So thanks for putting up with me and a little or no sleep.

01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:06.860
 It's been really strange just working through something the last two, three, four weeks.

01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:13.780
 But I do pretty well, and I'm blessed to be able to have a job here where I can just sit

01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:15.780
 here and chat for a few hours in the morning.

01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:20.900
 And I'd have to get up and tote that barge and lift that bale with no sleep.

01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:22.020
 It just wouldn't be good.

01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:27.420
 But I'm really feeling like we're closing in on the spiritual significance of it.

01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:29.340
 And everything is, in my opinion.

01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:31.220
 So that's what we're working on.

01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:33.180
 So we'll see.

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:34.180
 So we'll see you tomorrow.

01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:35.180
 We have Ben Swan.

01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:38.860
 He's a very interesting investigative reporter.

01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:41.500
 And Ben Swan will be here tomorrow at 9 o'clock.

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:45.460
 He has a whole new thing that he's doing that we're going to get involved with, kind of

01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:54.180
 a supplement or an addition or forget, an alternative to a lot of the video platforms

01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:57.700
 that we're just getting censored on anyway.

01:37:57.700 --> 01:37:59.100
 So what's the point?

01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:00.780
 And then also George Wiseman.

01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:05.300
 If you're interested in the hydrogen gas, the blue, the hydrogen gas and the browns

01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:07.980
 gas, he's going to be here around 1030.

01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:10.460
 So get your questions for George.

01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:12.460
 If you have a machine, you have questions.

01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:16.860
 Or if you don't, you might want to think about getting one or not.

01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:17.860
 Just hang out.

01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:21.580
 We're going to learn a lot about browns gas and hydrogen.

01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:25.180
 One of the most abundant, my nose is itching, somebody's talking about me.

01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:31.100
 One of the most abundant molecules anywhere in the world is molecular hydrogen.

01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.100
 Did you know that?

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:39.220
 Adam Bergstrom says it's also on both sides of the elemental scales thing.

01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:40.740
 So that's something about that.

01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:41.820
 All right, kids.

01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:42.820
 I'll see you.

01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:43.820
 We'll see you tomorrow.

01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:45.540
 I'll put Dr. Peat's up there so this will be on YouTube.

01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:47.700
 So it'll be easy for you to find it.

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:49.780
 I love you all, as I said, very much.

01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:51.460
 Thanks for everything.

01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:52.980
 And we'll see you in the morning.

01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:53.980
 OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:58.380
