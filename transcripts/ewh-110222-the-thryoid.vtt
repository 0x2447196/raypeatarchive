 You're listening to Holistic Living, brought to you by EastWest Healing and Performance.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 And now, here are your hosts, Josh and Jeanne Rubin.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Hey everyone, this is Josh Rubin from EastWest Healing and Performance.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Welcome to our blog talk radio show today.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Today we're going to have Ray Peat on again. I'll do his little introduction in a little bit.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Once we get him on here, and like always, we're probably going to have a little bit of an issue getting him on, so just hold tight.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 We do our radio show every month, once a month.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000

 760-597-9727.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 We always want to put that out there.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Once again, we've got Ray Peat on our show.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Of course, you know we've been following him for some time.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 We've been really lucky enough to get him on our show.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 You can learn more about Ray on his website. It's raypeat.com.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 He's got tons of great articles that would probably keep you occupied for the next 100 years,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 as well as a lot of great books that you can order.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 You can send in a check, and he'll ship those to you.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 His books are just fabulous, to be honest with you.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 He's got a newsletter that you can sign up for that comes out every quarter, as well as he's an artist.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 This guy's got a lot going on.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 He's got a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon, and he specializes in physiology.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 You can pretty much get that from reading his articles.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 If you want to start reading his stuff, my recommendation is read an article, reread it,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 but move on because you can start to connect the dots in all his articles.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Sorry about this, guys. Once again, we're having a little bit of an issue getting him on here.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 What's the problem?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 His phone number.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Hold on a second, guys. I'm sorry about this once again.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 We are running into technical difficulties.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 He has taught at many schools, including the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 You can look at his website.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 He's taught at other schools that, unfortunately, I can't pronounce that are in Mexico and things like that.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 He started most of his work studying progesterone and hormones back in 1968.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 He's got a lot of different papers and dissertations on that that he published in 1972.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Since then, he's been working on practical and theoretical aspects on his view with hormones and the thyroid and things like that.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 You know, and the bottom line is the guy is just a genius.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 He's got a lot of stuff out there.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 He's got a lot of stuff that, unfortunately, I would say most people will poo-poo and say that it's a bunch of baloney,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 but I can tell you that from reading his stuff, doing this for the past 12 years, that, honestly, his stuff is cutting edge.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 He's probably 80 years ahead of his time, if not more.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 So if you really want to be progressive and you're a practitioner, read his stuff.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 You can work with people like myself and other people that have studied his stuff for years, or you can call him and email him.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Maybe do consult with him.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 I don't know how he works that, but you can definitely ask him some questions today on the radio show.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 So enough of me rambling, because that's pretty much what I'm doing.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Let's get them on the show and let's get the show started.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 We're going to be talking about the thyroid today.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Probably will not take callers, because if you listen to the show, you can probably come to the conclusion that when I take a caller

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 and the caller is not there, it kind of aggravates me.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 I find it superficient, and unfortunately, I find it a little disrespectful for us.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 So I'm not going to take callers.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 If there is time permitting at the end, I will, but unfortunately, if you're calling from the 858, I will not take your call.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 So enough about that.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 So let's get them on the show.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Hey, Ray and Jeannie, are you there?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Oh, they're not there.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Hold on a second.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 >> Yeah, we are.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Hey, Josh.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 >> Oh, hey, Jeannie.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Hey, Ray, are you on?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 >> Yeah, I'm here.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 >> Oh, there he is.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 How's it going, Ray?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 >> Good.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 >> Good.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 So I just did your gigantic introduction once again, so people got to know who you are and where you've been, you know,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 where you've come from and what you have to offer, because we feel you have a lot to offer,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 and that's why we want to do the show to, you know, get your stuff out there.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 So once again, we really appreciate you taking time out to come on our show and really educate people on your science,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 because that's what it really is and how the body works.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 So today we're going to be talking about the thyroid, and I know we could talk for probably days on that,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 but we want to kind of simplify it for the public.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 So me and Jeannie got a list of, you know, outline probably 12 questions/topics that we want to go into

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 and then some questions from our audience.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 So I guess -- do you want to add anything before we start, before we get going on the show?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 >> No.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 >> Okay.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 We're ready to rock.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 You know, in a lot of your articles in your science, you get a lot on the thyroid.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 So maybe you could enlighten us on why you study the thyroid so much

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 and why you feel the thyroid hormone is so important or the most important hormone in the body.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 >> Okay.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 So looking at life in general, plants and funguses and amoebas are the organisms that apparently don't need

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 or don't want thyroid.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 But as soon as you get what we think of as real animal life, that includes corals, cylinderets, echinoderms,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 mollusks, crustaceans, insects, just about everything that has an organization to it uses thyroid.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 And the basic function of thyroid is to energize cells and to give them enough energy

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 and sufficient energy and sufficiency to allow them to differentiate so that they don't just concentrate on eating

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 and growing the way plants and amoebas and fungi and such do.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 And some of the old experiments would -- in an aquarium with developing frog eggs,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 as soon as the eggs would hatch into tadpoles, they would either add an antithyroid chemical

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 or a little bit of thyroid hormone to the water.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 And if you added the antithyroid chemical, the tadpole would never turn into a frog.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 It would just get it to be a huge tadpole.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 But if you added thyroid to the aquarium, the tiny hatchling tadpole would turn into a tiny spider-like frog

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 just about the size of a fly, showing that the thyroid, which energizes the cells so that they use oxygen

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 and produce a huge amount of energy, this energy allows the cells to realize their function.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 But when it comes on too early, they neglect to grow.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 So without thyroid, all you have is growth, and that's fine for amoebas and mushrooms and trees and so on.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 But in humans, it can lead to things like tumors and malformations and so on.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 So the energy production is really the basis of all organized life, and that makes the thyroid, in a sense,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 the main gland.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Really, if you take out the pituitary gland, which people have talked about as the master gland,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 many different animals, if you remove that and give them thyroid hormone, in some cases,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 the animals live 10 times as long as normal, usually about twice as long as normal,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 for the lack of the pituitary gland, as long as they had adequate thyroid.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 So you're saying what most people say is that thyroid is your master regulator of metabolism.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 It's the thing that's going to keep your body in an efficient state or an anti-inflammatory state

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 where you're producing energy more efficiently than you're expending energy.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Right. The inflammatory state means that something has gone wrong.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 It's interesting that doctors very often go entirely on the basis of the amount of pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 in diagnosing your thyroid status, but the thyroid-stimulating hormone creates all sorts of inflammatory processes,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 and when you have enough actual thyroid hormone to completely shut down your pituitary,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 you turn off practically all of these toxic inflammatory processes.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 Right. It's interesting because, at least from our standpoint,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 there's so many people that are coming to see us in our clinic, and I would say even from teaching all over,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 that we're seeing all these people that are being diagnosed with hypothyroid.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 What's your take on all these labs that people are doing?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 A, what's the validity of these, and what do you recommend when it comes to measuring thyroid function in itself?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 In the 1930s, it was standard medical practice to have a little apparatus to allow the person to lie down,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 usually with an empty stomach, and to breathe oxygen for two minutes,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 and they would measure how much oxygen was used.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 And people who had the standard symptoms of low thyroid function would often consume only half the normal amount of oxygen in allotted time,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 and that usually went with their hands and feet being cold, and their core body temperature being below normal,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 and their heart rate being somewhat slower than normal.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 And as they looked at the more biochemical indicators,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 they saw that cholesterol was almost invariably high in proportion to the reduced consumption of oxygen and lower body temperature.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 So the increasing cholesterol was like a mirror image of the decreasing metabolic rate and thyroid function.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 And if you would give a thyroid supplement to someone with excess cholesterol,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 it would immediately come down exactly in relation to the increasing oxygen use.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Keratin excess was another identifying feature.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 The doctor would look at a person's palm of the hand, looking at the calluses.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 A hypothyroid person typically would have cold and pale hands,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 but usually with orange areas where the skin was thickened in the calluses.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 That's because vitamin A is used directly in proportion to your metabolic rate, protein turnover, and thyroid function.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 And if your thyroid is low, you barely use your keratin, hardly convert it to vitamin A.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 And so the keratin typically would accumulate enough to show up as orange areas where the skin was thick.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 And in the ovary, it was found that the normal corpus luteum, or yellow body where progesterone is made,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 in these women who were hypothyroid, the corpus luteum would be dark red because of accumulated beta-keratin.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 And that keratin would block the production of progesterone,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 causing amenorrhea in the typical hypothyroid woman.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Another good indicator that was developed in the 1930s was the Achilles reflex relaxation speed.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 A person kneels on a chair so their toes hang over loosely,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 and you thump the Achilles tendon so that the calf muscle twitches.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Sometimes a low thyroid person won't have really any reflex that you can see,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 but if they do have a reflex so their toe twitches out,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 the hypothyroid person's muscle relaxes so slowly that their foot returns like a door with a pneumatic closer on it,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 a little jerky relaxation.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 And the electrocardiogram shows the same thing.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 The T-wave is called the repolarization wave,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 and it's exactly the same thing as in the relaxation of your calf muscle.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 In a hypothyroid person, the T-wave is delayed and low, usually flattened out.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 And the same thing happens in all of your body processes.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 When your brain is tired, the nerves are slow to relax,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 and so your sleep will not be as relaxing and restorative as it would be in a high thyroid state.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 So just touching upon that, just for a lot of the people that are listening,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 and maybe you want to clarify this a little bit deeper,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 the slow relaxation of the calf muscle can give you an indication of hypothyroid.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 Is it because of low blood sugar?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 Is it because of increased serotonin or calcium?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 If you could explain a little bit, I guess, more surface-y so people can understand that.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 All of those things contribute.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 The thyroid allows you to take up oxygen efficiently and oxidize it completely.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 And in proportion to the lack of thyroid, when you stimulate a muscle cell or a nerve cell,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 it will use its oxygen inefficiently.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 It will allow calcium to enter the cell and keep it in an excited state,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 and it will tend to produce lactic acid rather than carbon dioxide.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 And carbon dioxide produced under the influence of the thyroid is needed to carry the exciting calcium

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 out of the cells and allow the cell to relax.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 So all of those things you mentioned are involved in the delayed relaxation.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 So just to reiterate to people, or just I guess to summarize so I understand it too,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 so you mentioned, you know, it's almost like everyone says, "You have thyroid problems.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Look at the thyroid."

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 So you're really saying that high cholesterol is a huge indicator of low thyroid

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 and that we can actually look at the contraction or the lack of thereof,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 relaxation of the calf muscle as another indicator of -- we could say,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 I don't want to say thyroid problem, but maybe slower metabolism

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 or maybe thyroid issue in a sense.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 Is there any other things you recommend?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 I know you talk a lot about pulse and temperature and things like that,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 and I'm sure that's a huge topic, but maybe we can chat a little bit about, you know,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 why you look at body temperature and why you look at pulse.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 And, you know, everyone else is focusing on TSH and free T4 and free, you know, free T3 and TPO

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 and all this stuff, and I don't know if you do or don't, but maybe you want to touch on maybe if you don't and why.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 Okay.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Well, the idea of free and bound hormones, it's purely a laboratory construction.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 And in the case of thyroid, it usually has some relation to symptoms,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 but it's a little bit analogous to reading tea leaves because the --

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 actually, when thyroid hormone is stuck to the albumin protein,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 which is the main protein in the blood, it has no trouble at all getting into cells,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 taking the thyroid into the mitochondria and the nucleus and so on.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 So the free thyroid test does correspond for a variety of indirect reasons to the real available activity of the thyroid,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 but it's really just a laboratory construction that should be minimized.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 So even touching upon TSH, you know, what are your thoughts on TSH even in regards --

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 because I know a lot of the different values out there are very different, you know,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 and they're always changing a little.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 If you could touch upon, you know, if you even would recommend focusing on TSH that much,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 and if you do, what would you say some of the values should be?

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Yeah.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 I don't recommend it as a way to diagnose hypothyroidism, but I do recommend if you're looking at a blood test,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 I would recommend having as close to zero TSH as you can get because all of the known effects of TSH are really harmful in some way.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 The main reason doctors are giving currently for not wanting to suppress TSH is they think because TSH reduces the turnover indicators of bone,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 that this idea developed as a way to sell estrogen.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Estrogen was never shown to increase bone growth in humans, but it did stop the osteoclast function,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 so it reduced bone turnover, and so they said this is evidence that estrogen is preventing osteoporosis

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 because it stops the breakdown of bone, and since TSH also stops the osteoclast and the turnover of bone,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 doctors said if we suppress it, that'll cause osteoporosis, but in fact,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 the indicators that were used to argue that estrogen was protecting the bones,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 they named the protein osteoprotegin, meaning bone-protecting protein,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 and for several years they were using that as a way to sell estrogen and other drugs that would increase it,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 but pretty soon it turned out that osteoprotegin is closely associated with bone loss, osteoporosis,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 osteopenia, and calcification of the soft tissues, and it turns out that thyrotropin, TSH, like estrogen,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 increases osteoprotegin, increases the movement of calcium into your arteries and heart and out of the bones,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 so the main argument doctors have for keeping your TSH up to not below one is often what they say,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 but their very evidence is the opposite of what they think it is.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 So it's interesting because a lot of doctors focus so much on TSH,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 and you're saying don't focus on TSH in the diagnosis.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 That was developed by the actual biological indicators that were developed in the 1930s.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 About 40% of the American population showed low metabolic rate associated with symptoms,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 which were cured by giving thyroid enough to bring their metabolic rate up,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 but in the late 1940s, the drug companies synthesized thyroxine,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 and they tested it on 25-year-old male medical students,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 and in these healthy young men, they said it worked just like armor thyroid.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 It worked just like the thyroid hormone, and on the basis of that almost non-existent evidence

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 that it was equivalent to the thyroid hormone function, they began selling it,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 and they were developing tests to diagnose who needed it,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 and they didn't have tests to measure very small amounts of the actual hormone,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 so they measured protein-bound iodine,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 and it seemed that 95% of the population had enough protein-bound iodine,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 and that idea came to be accepted as the normal.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 In the 1960s and '70s, the immunoassays were developed

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 that could actually measure the amount of thyroxine in the blood,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 and it turned out that protein-bound iodine didn't have anything to do with thyroid function,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 but doctors had learned that 95% of the population were not hypothyroid,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 so when they learned to measure thyroid-stimulating hormone,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 they applied the measurements to this meaningless doctrine

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 that only 5% of the population were hypothyroid,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 so it's a good test, but the context and history have made it irrelevant to actual diagnosis.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 Now, what about -- and I think from reading your stuff, Mike,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 and I could be wrong and you could have just said it, I'm just hearing it differently --

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 there's just too many factors like adrenaline, cortisol, prolactin, estrogen,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 all these things that can actually -- that are down-regulating the thyroid,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 that are showing you "your hypothyroid."

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 It's not really the thyroid that's the problem;

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 it's all these other things based on the stress response or toxins or blood sugar

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 that are creating the lab result; is that correct?

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 Yes.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 About 10 years ago, I started hearing people telling me that their doctors had diagnosed them

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 as being both hyperthyroid and hypothyroid at the very same moment.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 More and more people were getting this diagnosis,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 which really shows that a crisis of confusion had taken over the profession around 10 years ago,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 that people on the basis of their blood tests could be both hyper and hypo at the same time,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 and this misleading indicator diagnosis led them to diagnose many people

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 who were suffering hypothyroidism as hyperthyroid without measuring their oxygen consumption,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 their body temperature, or looking at most of their symptoms

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 and how many calories they were burning in a day, looking at these other indicators,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 people who were clearly hypothyroid and who would lose their symptoms if they took a thyroid supplement,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 they were being diagnosed as hyperthyroid, having either their thyroid gland removed

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 or being given radioactive iodine to destroy it on the basis of a complete misunderstanding

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 of even what constitutes hyperthyroidism.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 Right.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 So I guess based on your approach, the other test, like I kind of mentioned,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 is really looking at body temperature.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 So maybe if you could -- because I think for a lot of people, this is probably the --

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 I find it's -- you don't have to pay a lot of money for it.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 It's an easy task for the practitioner to get a baseline of your client,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 but it's great for the client or just the average Joe that's listening

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 to really start to become aware of what's going on.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 So maybe tell us, like, what does a low body temperature mean or low pulse or high pulse?

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 And why do you use these as, you know, indicators of a baseline of our metabolism?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 Broda Barnes, when he was working as a physician in the '30s, he was a Ph.D. researcher

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 and he identified much of the physiology of hypothyroidism, but then he became a medical doctor

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 and he practiced most of his life in Colorado where the weather is very cool even in the summer.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 And for his patients, the temperature was a very adequate way of diagnosing,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 and he describes the temperature -- waking temperature he thought should be maybe around 97.8,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 and then after breakfast it should rise to, during the day, somewhere around 98.6.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 And in Eugene, in hot summer weather, I saw the same people who in the winter would have very low oral temperature.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 I saw that in the hot, humid summer weather, these hypothyroid people were maintaining a normal core temperature,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 and sometimes their hands would be cold even in hot weather, but I saw that a low metabolizing person,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 given some environmental support, can manage to keep their temperature pretty close to normal.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 And so I saw that their pulse rate, even when their temperature might be 98.5 during the daytime,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 often they would have a pulse rate of 45 or 55 or 65, somewhere below optimal.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 And that started me thinking about the factors that regulate body temperature,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 and I saw some people who had extreme hypothyroidism who would oscillate between extreme depression and extreme mania.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 And when they were going into depression, their temperature would be consistently low,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 and once they switched over to the manic phase, they would wake up with a pulse rate of maybe 75 or 80,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 and a temperature right where Broderbarns wanted it.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 And so besides just the average pulse rate and temperature,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 I saw that after those people would eat a big breakfast, their temperature would fall.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 By 11 o'clock, they would show up a hypothyroid temperature.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 And during the night, everyone tends to have more of the stress hormones,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 alternating surges of adrenaline and cortisol, for example.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 And the people who went past the exhaustion phase of hypothyroidism and reached the manic phase

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 kept extremely high levels of cortisol and adrenaline and usually other transmitters like serotonin.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 And since food reduces stress somewhat, getting your blood sugar up, and daylight also reduces stress,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 if you see their temperature and pulse rate fall after a good meal,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 that is another thing that reveals behind those indicators that can reveal a low metabolic rate

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 was just being held up by emergency stimulation from adrenaline and cortisol.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 So just to summarize once again for everyone I'm seeing,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 what I'm saying is if we don't eat the right foods,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 if we're not eating foods that provide our body with the right amount of protein, sugar, carbs, and fat,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 or for any reason if our body goes into that sympathetic stress state,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 it's going to provide our body with more oxygen and glucose.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 So if we don't get that from our foods or downregulant inflammation,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 you'll see these specific hormones inhibit how the thyroid works,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 you're going to get a lower body temperature.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 So even though you think you're eating healthy foods, if your body temperature does go down,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 it could be the ratios, but it could actually be the quality of the foods inhibiting how your metabolism should work.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Same thing with the pulse.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 I mean you're saying, I want to clarify because a lot of people think the opposite,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 that if someone has a low pulse, our society believes that that actually means they're healthy.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 I always use the example of like Lance Armstrong, everyone says,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 well his resting heart rate is whatever it is, like 40, and everyone thinks that's super healthy.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 But you're saying that people with a low resting heart rate,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 that means they're actually downregulating their own metabolism because of the foods that they're eating

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 or the wrong foods they're eating.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Yeah, and it tends to go with fertility problems, hormonal problems, low testosterone, increased estrogen,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 a lot of degenerative problems.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Right.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 So that's great.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 I mean I think that's important for people to understand because it's such an easy tool, you know,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 to do at home and during the day to see what's going on.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 Let's talk about the hormones a little bit so people get an idea of, okay, we know what a thyroid is.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 Let's talk about some of these hormones like T3 and T4

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 and where most of this -- what is most of this conversion happen in the body?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 Because everyone thinks it's the thyroid and maybe you can kind of enlighten us maybe where most of this is happening.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 Well, Brode Varnes was one of the first people to notice the importance of the liver in thyroid function.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 The Biscons in 1942 to '45 were showing how the liver regulates hormones,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 but they were concentrating on estrogen.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 And if the liver was lacking thyroid or protein or some vitamins,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 the Biscons showed that your estrogen would skyrocket in proportion to the reduced function of the liver.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 And there's this antagonism focused on the liver between estrogen and thyroid.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 And the thyroid works partly by increasing protein synthesis,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 but partly by simply energizing the liver so that it is able to detoxify everything that shouldn't be in the body.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 The liver should remove 100% of the estrogen that reaches it in circulation.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 So the body should be able to produce estrogen in the ovary, for example,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 send it to do its work in the uterus and breast and so on,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 but then it should immediately be destroyed by the liver.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 And if your thyroid is low, the liver loses the ability to detoxify estrogen

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 and practically everything else harmful.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 And the liver happens to also be the source, as Brita Barnes discovered, of the most active thyroid.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 He said it's about two-thirds of the thyroid used by the body is produced in the liver.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 And if your liver isn't getting enough sugar, enough glucose, or if it doesn't have enough selenium,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 it is unable to convert thyroxine into T3.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 If you can completely knock out the liver and your thyroid will excrete about this ratio of three parts of thyroxine

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 to one part of T3, and so as long as your thyroid is working,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 your liver will be getting a little bit of T3 and will be able to keep functioning,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 other things being equal.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 But if you're under stress, for example, don't have anything to eat for about 24 hours

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 or are exerting too much energy in proportion to what you're eating,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 your liver isn't getting enough glucose to convert the three parts of thyroxine produced in your gland

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 into the active T3.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 And so you will have this drastic decrease in production of the active triiodothyronine, T3,

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 most of which comes from the liver when it's well fed with sugar.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 If the doctor prescribes only T4, it will work fine in anyone who doesn't need it,

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 such as 25-year-old healthy men, but women, because of their higher estrogen level,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 have many times the incidence of thyroid problems and liver problems that men do,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 and it's because of the centrality of the liver to the activation of thyroid hormone

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 and the liver's essentiality for eliminating estrogen that a little problem with either thyroid

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 or estrogen means that your liver will allow estrogen to increase in the body

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 as it decreases its production of active thyroid hormone,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 and that in turn slows the liver even more so it has a vicious circle.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 Did everyone get all that?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 Good stuff.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 So what you're saying is we need selenium to convert T4 to T3,

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 and so I'm just kind of summarizing it for myself and for the listeners,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 so I can kind of follow along here.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 And selenium, I think we need to ask the question, which we'll get to,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 is where do we get that from besides, you know, what foods?

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 We need glucose to make the conversion, and we should talk about that,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 because I think that's huge in our society.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 When it comes to foods, we should say the right vegetables and things like that.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 Most people are staying away from the right types of sugars which could be creating this,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 and that's probably going to be a whole show in itself.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 But at the same time, from maybe exogenous sources or the body's inability to detox it,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 blood sugar issues, excess stress, but the estrogen itself will block the T4 to T3 conversion as well.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 But also, I don't want to use the word clog up, but back up the liver,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 and it will just keep backing up the liver, which can create the hypodermic-like symptoms.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 And once that happens, the estrogen can reach the point at which it starts inhibiting the thyroid gland itself,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 the thyroid gland to produce the proper ratio of three parts T4 to one part of T3.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 It does that by breaking down the thyroglobulin, a colloidal kind of glob of protein inside the follicles of the gland.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 This has to be digested as needed, breaking each protein molecule down

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 and releasing these free thyroxine and T3 hormones.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 And estrogen inhibits the proteolytic enzyme that releases the hormone.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 So first it slows down liver function, but then it reaches a point where it will even block the thyroid itself.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 And this is where women tend to have a high frequency of goiter thyroid enlargement.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 They call it Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but most often it's what they used to call colloid goiter,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 where since estrogen stimulates the stress hormones in the brain, increasing thyroid stimulating hormone,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 estrogen causes the pituitary to drive the thyroid harder.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 Meanwhile, it's blocking the ability of the thyroid gland to secrete it, so it tends to enlarge the thyroid

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 and then they get diagnosed as having thyroiditis.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 Progesterone happens to activate these proteins that allow the thyroid to secrete.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 I advise women who have an enlarged thyroid not to take progesterone

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 until they've taken care of the enlargement of the thyroid,

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 because progesterone will normalize the protein so fast that sometimes they'll go into a slightly hyperthyroid state for a few weeks.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 Now correct me if I'm wrong, you actually talk about it in your book,

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 because everyone talks about hypothyroidism, we're kind of skipping a beat here,

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 but you talk about hyperthyroidism, and I know you're against unsaturated fats and things like that,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 but when people are hyperthyroid, it's probably the only time, and correct me if I'm wrong,

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 you recommend people having small amounts of cauliflower juice or cabbage juice

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 to actually use the estrogen and the excess cortisol to downregulate the thyroid.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 Is that true?

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 Well, yeah, except that's mostly for the person's relationship with their doctor.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 Several people have told me that before they had their thyroid destroyed by surgery or radiation,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 they said they had a chronic pulse rate of 125 per minute,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 but they never felt so good in their life after having the thyroid gland treated.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 They were back to feeling their normal bad self,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 but people usually feel great when they're in the so-called hyperthyroid state,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 and the reason I tell people how to use cabbage juice and such to slow their pulse

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 is that their doctors become a danger to them,

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 tending to bully them into having their thyroid gland suppressed.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 All right.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 So we talked about TSH, T3, T4.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 I know a lot of people out there come in with lab values where they have a high T4 reading.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 What does that mean, and what are some of the symptoms, and what are most doctors recommending?

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 What do you recommend?

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 It very often goes with hypothyroidism because if your liver can't activate it,

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 if you aren't producing so much estrogen that your gland gets shut off completely,

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 your gland will go on producing hormone,

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 and you'll get along in your daily life with a little bit of T3 coming out of your thyroid gland,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 but that gradually allows the T4 to accumulate because your liver isn't using it up,

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 and that tends to slow down even the production of T3 if you get a very high T4 level.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 And what originally got me interested in this interaction of T4 and T3

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 was a patient at the medical school in Portland

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 who was a slightly hypothyroid woman who was prescribed T4 for a few months.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 On one grain of equivalent of T4, 100 micrograms,

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 she got even more hypothyroid symptoms, and her doctor increased it to 200 micrograms,

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 and a few months later she was even worse.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 So I think he reached 400 or 500 micrograms of T4,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 at which point she went into a myxedema coma and was taken to the hospital unconscious,

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 and they injected T3, pure T3, and she came right out of the coma.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 But her symptoms got worse directly in proportion to the increased dose of T4,

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 and after seeing that extreme example,

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 I have run across probably 100 women with less extreme effects,

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:23.000
 but it isn't rare at all for a woman to get worse symptoms,

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 noises in their head or electrical sensation in their body or swollen muscles

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 or any of the thousand symptoms of hypothyroidism as a result of taking too much T4.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 Great stuff here.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 So let's talk about going back towards hypothyroidism and talking about how, you know,

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 we know, or I should say I know and maybe people don't,

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 but things like blood sugar dysregulation, adrenaline, cortisol, pituitary,

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 all these things can create hypothyroidism, but at the same time,

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 how does hypothyroidism affect these things such as blood sugar, adrenaline, cortisol,

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 pituitary, parathyroid, digestion, liver? I mean, how does it really affect our physiology?

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 When you aren't able to oxidize your sugar all the way to carbon dioxide,

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 you produce lactic acid very easily.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 Even at rest, a person will keep producing lactic acid as if they were under strenuous exercise,

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 and the lactic acid turns on a lot of inflammatory mediators which have systemic effects on your bone and skin,

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 hair growth, everything.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:04.000
 Lactic acid itself acts as a toxin, and gradually, if you're experiencing that year after year,

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 it leads to a tendency to fibrosis and arthritis and so-called connective tissue diseases in general

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 from an imbalance of the inflammatory mediators, histamine and serotonin especially,

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 and a tendency of the soft tissues to calcify, so it contributes to hardening of the arteries and heart failure.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 So, I don't want to say that it's kind of like an end-all, be-all, but, you know,

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 from meeting yourself and then chatting with you, it's almost like if we can get people to regulate their blood sugar,

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 eat the right foods, or regulate their thyroid, it's almost like you can affect so many systems in the body

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 which can actually help with joint pain, digestive problems, lack of energy, menstrual problems, edema.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 I mean, the list just keeps going on and on and on.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 Is that true?

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 I mean, it's almost like we're focusing on one system, but it's like killing two birds with one stone type of thing.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 We're focusing on this one system, but we're getting so many other benefits.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 Yeah, because the energy production in the proper way is really what shapes everything.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000
 The body is constantly renewing itself moment by moment.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 Like overnight, people have measured that there's a 60% turnover of brain substance in one night

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 just because the brain has a high metabolic rate.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 And if you aren't renewing yourself at a high rate, you're allowing errors to accumulate.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:07.000
 And one of the reasons thyroid and other problems get worse over time is that our diets, on average,

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 contain a significant amount of thyroid-inhibiting substances, especially the polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 And the French did a series of studies that really define how that works.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 Long ago, people knew that polyunsaturated fats blocked proteolytic enzymes.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 And in this French series of studies, they saw that the first effect of too much polyunsaturated fat

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 is to block the ability of the thyroid gland to secrete the hormone by breaking down the thyroid globulin.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 And then if the thyroid manages to secrete it,

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 the transport of it on proteins in the blood is inhibited in proportion to the unsaturation.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 So the fish oil, many five and six unsaturated bonds are the most powerful,

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 almost total inhibitors of thyroid transport.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 But linoleic acid with three double bonds inhibits about 50%,

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:33.000
 and linoleic acid with two double bonds inhibits about 30%.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 So it's proportional to the number of double bonds, the transport.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.000
 And the same thing happens inside the cell.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 The responsiveness of the cell to thyroid is inhibited in proportion to the amount of unsaturated fats.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 And carotene, even though it's not a fatty acid, is highly unsaturated,

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 and it has that same effect of interfering with thyroid function just because of this series of unsaturations.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:23.000
 The accumulated unsaturated fats in the body turn on other antithyroid processes,

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:32.000
 so it isn't all immediate and direct, but they make you more susceptible to turning on prostaglandins,

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 which promote inflammation and increase the tendency to produce lactic acid.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:49.000
 And they interfere, apart from the thyroid, they interfere with the mitochondrial oxidative energy production.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:55.000
 So after you're 30 or 40 or so,

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 almost everyone has accumulated enough of the PUFA to cause a whole range of metabolic problems.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 So while we're kind of on the topic of, I don't want to go too much into PUFAs,

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 but let's go and chat about just estrogen levels and how, we talked about how they block hypothyroidism,

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 but how hypothyroidism can raise those.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 And I think it's a huge concern because most, I shouldn't say most,

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 but a lot of women are being prescribed these medications, number one.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 Most people are having issues with detoxifying their body of these estrogens, number two.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 And having this unopposed estrogen in the body can lead to specific dysfunctions or diseases like clotting and edema,

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 fibrosis, cysts and all these things.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 There are very close interactions between the increased estrogen, and you mentioned clotting,

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 estrogen increases serotonin dominance.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 And serotonin and estrogen both promote and are promoted by the polyunsaturated fats and the low thyroid condition.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 So it forms sort of a polar cluster with the energizing thyroid and the good nutrients, sugar, minerals, protein,

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.000
 and so on, maintaining and energizing the structure.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:47.000
 The emergency stress things, the prostaglandins, serotonin, histamine, cortisol,

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 and estrogen are all on the short-term defensive side, but when they become dominant,

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 they deform the proper regulatory systems.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 All right.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:29.000
 There's a special problem with the basis for diagnosing estrogen deficiency because in the absence of anti-estrogen substances

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 such as progesterone, the estrogen in the blood can go to a very low level because the estrogen is staying inside cells.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:52.000
 Progesterone knocks it out of cells, inactivates it, but causes it to appear in the bloodstream on its way out the kidneys.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 So in the absence of progesterone, doctors will measure a low level of serum estrogen and prescribe it,

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 even though they're under that situation, it's very likely that their tissues, breast and uterus in particular,

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:20.000
 are actually overloaded with a chronic supply of estrogen.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.000
 I wish I could summarize that.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000
 I'm at a loss on that one, so I'm going to move on.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:33.000
 I highly recommend everyone relistening to these shows over and over again because it's an hour plus of information

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000
 that you could literally sit down and probably take 50 pages of notes on.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:43.000
 I want to talk about CO2, carbon dioxide, in the thyroid because I know you're a fan of CO2,

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:49.000
 but from reading your stuff, you talk about the thyroid and you talk about carbon dioxide.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 How do thyroid hormones raise CO2 and what are the advantages of having higher CO2 levels?

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.000
 That means that you're oxidizing things completely.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:10.000
 If you oxidize fats completely, you get rid of any toxic effect from the free fatty acids,

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:23.000
 but you also stop producing lactic acid and stop that whole route of inflammatory harmful processes

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
 of free fatty acids and lactic acid.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:37.000
 But the carbon dioxide itself binds to all of our proteins, for example, hemoglobin in a diabetic.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:45.000
 They look at the amount of sugar or fragments attached to proteins such as hemoglobin,

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 but it's actually the breakdown of fatty acids which contribute about 95% of these glycated proteins

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
 that accumulate in diabetes and aging.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:11.000
 But when we're producing enough carbon dioxide, it not only protects the cell by removing the excitatory calcium,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:21.000
 but it also binds to all of our proteins that have a lysine group or another amine group exposed.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:29.000
 And these amines are where the breakdown products, free radical fatty acids

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:35.000
 and so-called glycation end products, it's where they bind.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:44.000
 And so carbon dioxide binds protectively to proteins, keeping them in the native youthful state,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:53.000
 which happens to be the things called hormone receptors are in a different state

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
 when there's adequate carbon dioxide.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
 Insulin is in a different state.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:09.000
 Growth hormone, all of our peptide hormones can bind carbon dioxide becoming a different substance.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:17.000
 So all of our hormone system is deranged if we just hyperventilate and blow out too much carbon dioxide

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
 or if we're hypothyroid, basically we're in effect hyperventilating even at rest,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
 producing lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:36.000
 So what you're saying is the more, I should say, the more CO2 we're essentially producing,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:44.000
 it allows our thyroid to work more efficiently, which is basically those levels are downregulating lactic acid

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
 and serotonin and all these inflammatory markers.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
 Is that correct?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
 Yes, the CO2 is in itself anti-inflammatory.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:00.000
 A lot of hospitals are now recognizing that they were killing patients by giving them pure oxygen

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:10.000
 or even hyperventilating them, and they can prevent most of the hospital-induced lung failure

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:18.000
 and a lot of brain damage by giving them carbon dioxide or just hypoventilating them

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:25.000
 so they accumulate their own carbon dioxide to a protective anti-inflammatory degree.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
 That's awesome stuff, man.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
 It's fascinating.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
 Let's just skip it a little.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
 What do you -- I know this is -- you really can't give 100 recommendations,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
 but let's talk about people that don't even have a thyroid.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
 What are your recommendations?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
 Because I got some questions about people, you know, I don't even have a thyroid.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
 What do I do?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
 Obviously nutrition is key and all those things,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
 but do you recommend them being on specific thyroid hormones?

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
 If you lived in a non-industrial culture,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000
 they would not have to remove the thyroid when they sell a chicken or a fish,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000
 and they would throw the beef and pork thyroid glands into a sausage mixture,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:19.000
 and so you would get dietary thyroid if you were eating the way people did even in America until 1940

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:27.000
 when the FDA came in, Agriculture Department, banned the sale of thyroid in food.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
 But looking at the natural diet,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:38.000
 everyone would be getting the equivalent of half a grain of glandular thyroid extract

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
 just as part of their ordinary animal food diet.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:52.000
 Shrimps, oysters, crabs, everything like that that doesn't have a vertebrate type of thyroid gland,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
 eating those you get some thyroid in your diet.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
 Milk contains some thyroid.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:04.000
 So babies who otherwise would be cretins, as long as they're breastfed,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
 they don't need a thyroid gland.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
 They get enough thyroid in their mother's milk.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000
 After Three Mile Island, a lot of babies were born without thyroid glands,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000
 but no one noticed the breastfed babies didn't have a thyroid until they were weaned,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
 and then they became hypothyroid drastically.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000
 So eating the right foods, avoiding the polyunsaturated fats

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:41.000
 and the hard-to-digest types of starch in a lot of beans, for example,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
 have starches that we can't digest.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:53.000
 Those irritate the intestine, create endotoxin that interferes with thyroid function.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:03.000
 So avoiding the toxic foods and emphasizing sweet fruits, milk, cheese, eggs, shellfish,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:13.000
 and among the meat, beef and lamb, if you include the fibrous parts

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:19.000
 that industrial societies tend to throw away, like in Mexico,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
 you get the skin in various preparations.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:33.000
 In Asia, they eat the tendons, ears, snouts, tails, and everything that are very rich in gelatin,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:42.000
 which is a prothyroid protein because it doesn't contain the precursors to serotonin.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:50.000
 Besides certain meats that you just mentioned and the more gelatinous type of proteins

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
 and the dairy, the non-inflammatory proteins,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000
 what are some other nutritional recommendations that you can maybe just enlighten us on

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:04.000
 in regards to the prothyroid or pro-liver, even to help the liver to detox?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
 So it's not always the thyroid.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
 If you get the liver to work properly, we'll get that benefit for the thyroid.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
 So what are some nutrition therapies that you recommend?

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:21.000
 Years ago, I read that women had a drastic hormone change when they were taking antibiotics,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:30.000
 and I realized that was probably because of the hormonal effect of intestinal toxins.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.000
 So I had some women measure their blood, estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
 and then eat a carrot a day for a few days and remeasure it.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:48.000
 The carrot has antibiotics, and the fiber can't be digested in the toxins by bacteria

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
 because of these antibiotics.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
 And after just a few days of a daily carrot,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:06.000
 their hormones were back in a very favorable state, reducing estrogen and cortisol, increasing progesterone and thyroid.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
 So you're saying that carrots--I mean, most people are going, "This is kind of silly,"

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
 but you're saying that a carrot, because of what the carrot is made up of,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.000
 actually helps the GI system in the liver to absorb toxins and to actually detoxify them.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000
 So you're saying people that maybe have thyroid issues or liver detox issues,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
 that using carrots as a therapeutic tool will benefit them.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:36.000
 Yes, a raw carrot, not a cooked carrot, because the carotene is an antithyroid factor.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.000
 But you can even rinse off some of the carotene after you grate it or shred it.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:48.000
 But a lot of hypothyroid people control their symptoms for years just by having a daily raw carrot

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000
 because of that cleansing effect on the intestine and the liver.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
 What other foods are going to enhance that T4-T3 conversion?

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:03.000
 I mean, I love which--we're hoping for it to do a whole show on sugar because it's a huge topic.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
 But you talk about glucose, you talk about selenium.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:13.000
 What are some other foods that people should be eating to actually help bring the thyroid to an efficient level

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
 but also help with that conversion, that T4-T3 conversion?

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:24.000
 The very sweet, low-fiber foods, filtered orange juice,

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:31.000
 well-strained orange juice from sweet oranges is the safest that I know of.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:40.000
 And there are several tropical fruits, probably 100 tropical fruits that are very safe and helpful.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:48.000
 One very odd food, if you have a centrifugal juicer, you can juice a raw potato

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:55.000
 and then cook the juice like you would scramble an egg and get rid of the starch.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:02.000
 But you have a very safe, high-quality protein and mineral formulation.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:12.000
 In practice, good orange juice and a few other tropical fruits are very good for your liver and thyroid balance.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
 Now, why do you say really good, strained orange juice?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
 Because I know you've mentioned that before.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:25.000
 Any of the indigestible fibers, the commercial orange juices,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:32.000
 they've learned enzymically to create new chemical substances that they sell as pulp.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:44.000
 It's a type of fiber that can't be digested and can't be removed from the juice once they've chemically altered it.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
 So you want to avoid the commercial pulpy so-called orange juices.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:10:00.000
 And if you make it yourself, just running it through a strainer is enough so that you don't feed the bacteria with these fibers that we can't digest.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
 I see. I see.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:15.000
 Of the proteins, of the common convenient proteins, cheese and eggs and shellfish are very high-quality

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:25.000
 and associated with prothyroid other nutrients, calcium, for example.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
 Same with your saturated fats.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
 I know you're a huge advocate of coconut oil because it's prothyroid.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000
 It helps the liver store glycogen and it helps the body detox from unsaturated fats.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000
 But someone actually had a question about coconut oil.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:49.000
 It is prothyroid, and I know you have a science and a philosophy on what type of coconut oil you recommend and why.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
 Maybe you can answer that for one of the listeners.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:04.000
 Well, I've had many very delicious, crude, simple, homemade coconut oils that are great for ice cream and puddings and such.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:20.000
 A lot of people are allergic to those aromatic, tasty things, and so just for safety, it's good to have it completely filtered so that there is no free fatty acid breakdown product

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:31.000
 and none of the solid particulate coconut matter or even the aromatic stuff, just for safety to avoid allergies.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:40.000
 But any of the purely saturated fats are anti-inflammatory.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:48.000
 So it's just that the coconut oil with the short chains, it's very quickly metabolized.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:12:02.000
 And so for things like losing weight, weightlifters have caught on to using the fractionated coconut oil to get even the shorter average chain length

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:15.000
 because it intensely increases the metabolic rate to have those shorter saturated fats, and they're anti-inflammatory, anti-histamine, and so on.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
 Right.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
 Any other nutritional recommendations?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:32.000
 Most of the listeners probably, some practitioners, some lay people, any other nutritional recommendations that you can toss in there in regards to proteins, fats, or carbs, lethargy, thyroid?

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:42.000
 Yeah, people are probably going to continue eating some vegetables just because they like them, but I encourage them to cook them to death.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:50.000
 Cook them as much as like 40 minutes of boiling makes them a lot safer.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:56.000
 There were experiments in the 1940s with rats.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:08.000
 They fed a selection of vegetables, either canned vegetables or the same vegetables raw, and the ones eating the canned vegetables thrived and were well nourished.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
 Even rats couldn't live on raw vegetables.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
 Right.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
 Right.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:31.000
 Awesome stuff, and I'm sure there's more in regards to the thyroid, but of course, I mean, we could spend hours talking about this, the hormonal implications, the liver, digestion, you know, what foods to eat,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:38.000
 but of course, we can't take up the next six days of your life as much as I'd love to.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
 Is there anything else you'd love to -- I mean, we're taking some callers now that we have a little bit of time left.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:51.000
 If you call from 858, I'm not going to answer the phone, but you're welcome to call in, anyone, 347-426-3546.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:58.000
 If you've got a question, when you call in, tell me the area code you're calling from and ask Ray the question,

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:05.000
 but is there anything else you want to add, Ray, in regards to thyroid that you think is important for the listeners to know?

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
 Nothing occurs to me.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
 Nothing comes to you?

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
 Yeah.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
 All right.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
 Well, I'm kind of out of all my questions.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:22.000
 I had a slew of questions, and like I said, I don't want to take up tons of your time because we really appreciate you coming on and educating us on this,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:31.000
 so we just want to say thanks, me and Jeannie, all the listeners, we're getting great e-mails and people just loving the shows and your information,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
 so we really appreciate it.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
 Okay.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
 Thanks.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
 So I want to wish you a happy day, and I guess we'll chat again.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
 Okay.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
 Very good.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
 Bye.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
 Have a good one.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
 Bye.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
 All right, guys, there you go.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000
 That's about an hour and 15 minutes of Ray P talking about the thyroid, nutritional therapies.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000
 Just one thing I want to say is, you know, if you're a practitioner,

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:06.000
 really understand the why behind what you're doing before you start telling people to do this or that or take this or eat a carrot.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
 I think that's important because I think people can easily, especially now,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
 well, all this information is all over the web and all over Facebook and YouTube.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.000
 I think people are, you know, and once again, this is my story, people just jumping on board

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
 and starting to, you know, eat gelatin and eat salt,

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
 and I think we're going to run into the same problem as every other system out there,

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
 and it's going to give the philosophy and the science a bad name.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000
 So I really recommend you reading his articles, reading his books, listening to the shows, taking notes.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
 I mean, I have to read his article ten times.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
 I mean, they're just so deep and you can get so much information.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
 So I highly recommend it.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000
 And at the same time, don't just think you can eat a carrot and you're going to help your thyroid.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:56.000
 And, you know, there's so much more to his philosophy than just eating a carrot or eating gelatin.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
 So really understand that.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
 So if you're the layperson and you're listening to the show and you just started eating a carrot,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
 and you're like, "Well, this is going to help my thyroid,"

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000
 just realize there's many pieces to the healing puzzle and there's many facets to this program,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
 and we had them for an hour and 15 minutes.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
 So just realize there's a lot more to it than that.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
 And if you've got questions, give us a call.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
 Like I said, give us a call and set up a consult with us,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
 and we can kind of helpfully educate you and let you know how we work.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
 We do have a caller, but unfortunately he's gone.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
 I'll maybe take the caller.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
 Let's see what we've got going on here.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.000
 Hello, 63, you're on the air, but Ray's gone, unfortunately.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
 Did you have a question?

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
 No.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
 That's why I don't take callers.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
 Anyway, guys, I really appreciate everyone tuning in.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
 Share the show.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
 I'll be emailing Ray to set up the April show.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000
 Not sure what we're going to be talking about next, but really appreciate everyone's support.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
 And if you're confused, guess what?

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
 That means you're actually learning.
