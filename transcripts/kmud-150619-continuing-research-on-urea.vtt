 Okay, so once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat joining us on the show

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.920
 to share in his latest research. Dr. Peat, are you there?

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.920
 Yes. Okay, thanks so much for joining us again.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.920
 As always, I'd just like to start the show by giving you the opportunity here

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.920
 to let people know your academic and scientific background, what you do, and who you are.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.920
 I got my PhD in biology, specializing in physiology and biochemistry,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.920
 especially reproductive physiology, at the University of Oregon in 1972.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.920
 Before that, I had been interested in language, philosophy, and psychology

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.920
 and planned to study brain biology, but I found that the reproductive physiology

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.920
 seemed more scientific and more interesting, so I specialized in that

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.920
 but continued to be interested in the rest of the organism.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.920
 So the first thing I did after graduating was to write a book on the brain,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:14.920
 reviewing Russian science, 19th century through the 20th century on brain biology.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:26.920
 So I've continued interest in how the basic energy physiology relates to things

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.920
 such as reproduction, aging, and brain functions.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.920
 Okay. All right. Well, I know that your most recent newsletter,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:45.920
 you were continuing your discourse and your thoughts on urea and its use in pathology

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:53.920
 and how you see the function of urea as benefiting people in light of perhaps it being dismissed,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.920
 if you like, by mainstream medical science.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:05.920
 I know that you mentioned Danopoulos, the Greek physician who's been successfully using urea

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.920
 as a therapy, injecting it into tumors and its use in cancer.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.920
 But this newsletter that you've most recently written more explores some other physiological effects

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.920
 of urea that perhaps people might not have been aware of, or if in fact the research

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.920
 has been done some time ago, it may now be buried and forgotten.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.920
 So I just wanted to pick up on quite a few of the things that you mentioned in your newsletter.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.920
 So, go ahead.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.920
 So, Dr. B, can you tell us what urea is?

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.920
 Its name chemically is carbamide.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.920
 It's just a combination of ammonia with carbon dioxide.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.920
 And so it's the body's way of detoxifying ammonia,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:01.920
 and it requires oxidative production of carbon dioxide to combine with the ammonia

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.920
 to get rid of it.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:09.920
 And so it regulates cell pH, which regulates water metabolism

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.920
 and everything else in cell function.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.920
 So it's something that our bodies produce.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.920
 Yeah.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.920
 All right.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.920
 So given that we now understand that excess water in the cell is a central feature

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.920
 of the major degenerative diseases that you outline, things like heart failure, dementia, and cancer,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.920
 how do you explain how this happens and what is the best strategy to prevent this

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.920
 if water accumulation in the cell is implied in such an inflammatory situation

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.920
 as these things that we've mentioned?

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:49.920
 One of the dimensions of thinking about water in cells is that it comes up against

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.920
 some of the basic dogmas of what life is and how cells work and so on.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:04.920
 And I think the reason that adenopolis amazing results in curing cancer with simply injecting

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:13.920
 or giving intravenous urea, I think the reason it's been ignored and dismissed is that it involves

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:22.920
 some ideas that don't fit with these mechanical dogmas of 20th century biology,

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:29.920
 such as the membrane theory, the idea that there are pumps in cell surface membranes

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:38.920
 that regulate the amount of water and minerals in cells by somehow grabbing the molecules

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.920
 and pushing them in or out of the cell.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:52.920
 It's really a silly, impossible concept, but it's what everything officially is based on.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:08:01.920
 So when you actually look at the facts of what's happening with water,

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:10.920
 if you think in terms of things such as what happens when a gelatin gets wet and swells up,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.920
 and if you put acid or alkali on what happens to its relation to water and so on,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.920
 acid makes it shrink, alkali makes it swell up,

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:34.920
 and simple physical ideas like that are very useful for thinking about what happens in all of the diseases.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.920
 Okay, and you said acid makes it shrink and alkaline situations make it swell.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:48.920
 Yes, and swelling has an anabolic effect and turns on cell division,

00:08:48.920 --> 00:09:03.920
 and uncontrollable cell division can produce everything from cancer to various skin diseases,

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:13.920
 dandruff, for example, psoriasis, overgrowth of fibrous tissue.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:22.920
 The control of cell growth is very deeply controlled by water and pH,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:36.920
 and so the membrane pump people blame everything in life on this magical pump that regulates the water and the pH.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:50.920
 But if you just think about the basic metabolic processes in which you turn sugar or fat or protein into energy and carbon dioxide,

00:09:50.920 --> 00:10:00.920
 this constant streaming of substance, the carbon dioxide is an acid and you're making it inside cells,

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:06.920
 and so when you're alive you're making cells acidic,

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:18.920
 and as it leaves it takes minerals out of the cell with it in the form of carbonic acid and the alkaline minerals associated with it.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.920
 So it's a better state than the alkaline state, right?

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:39.920
 Yes, the alkaline, the acidic state produced by carbon dioxide causes a shift in the whole balance of electrons in the protein, fat, nucleic acid system,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:51.920
 and that shift of electrons accounts for the preference of the cell for potassium normally over sodium.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:11:00.920
 If the cell is disturbed then it shifts and loses potassium and takes up calcium and sodium.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:08.920
 This is what Gilbert Ling has devoted his life to for the last 60 some years.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:18.920
 Sorry, I just wanted to say that this, I guess for people that are listening, I think a lot of people in the lay, lay people associate this kind of,

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.920
 what we're talking about acid versus alkali, they're always thinking about an acid situation is more cancer promoting

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.920
 and to be alkaline is a better situation in terms of health benefits.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.920
 That's true when you apply it to the blood and the fluid outside the cell.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.920
 Right.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:52.920
 But the reason the fluid outside the cells is alkaline is that the protons, the electrons are being retracted into an acidic state inside the cell

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:58.920
 and that shifts the balance and makes it alkaline outside.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.920
 Right.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.920
 So what you're saying is when the cell inside, and then when the inside of the cell becomes alkaline,

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:09.920
 that's when it becomes swollen and boggy and that's what can contribute to heart disease, cancer, psoriasis,

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.920
 all these degenerative diseases we've mentioned.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:17.920
 And that goes with a shift towards acidity in the blood and the outside fluid.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:25.920
 So that's where people are thinking about you don't want to be acidic metabolically.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.920
 That refers to the fluids outside the cells.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:40.920
 And it's only since the nuclear magnetic resonance apparatuses have been used the last 40 years mostly

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:46.920
 that people have started to recognize that inside cells should be slightly acidic.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.920
 Right.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:56.920
 So how do we make the inside of our cells more acidic and keep the outside of our cells, extracellular and the blood alkaline?

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:04.920
 Keeping the energy flowing, producing carbon dioxide constantly by consuming oxygen.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.920
 So we need our cells to be consuming oxygen properly.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.920
 Yeah.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:18.920
 And just suffocating, just turning off the oxygen supply so you stop making a steady supply of carbon dioxide,

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:32.920
 the metabolism shifts over to making lactic acid and the lactic acid takes acid out of the cell as it's leaving

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.920
 and acidifies the environment but leaves the cell more alkaline.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.920
 Right.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:47.920
 And that's a negative acidic situation that most people commonly refer to when they talk about acid versus alkaline blood.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.920
 Yeah, it's a local inflammatory situation.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:59.920
 Anytime a tissue is injured it tends to produce excess lactic acid and become inflamed and inefficient.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:07.920
 So how does urea help our cells use oxygen better?

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.920
 Or to keep the cell more acidic?

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:25.920
 The cell holds its structure by the way proteins are folded, which requires an interaction with the --

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:33.920
 everything in the cell has to participate in that slightly acidic state, making carbon dioxide,

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:45.920
 keeping the ATP level at a high energy state, keeping the water participating in the way proteins are folded

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:52.920
 so that there's a lot of internal surface area exposed in the cell.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:15:00.920
 You know how the surface of a glass of water has a sort of rubbery film on the top

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:06.920
 that you can float a piece of steel or such on the surface tension.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:13.920
 Inside the cell when the proteins are energized the ATP is holding them in this state,

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:24.920
 exposing their surface, keeping the cell's water in that energized tough state that helps to hold the cell together.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:32.920
 When it's de-energized the structure collapses in various ways.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:41.920
 For example, spherical proteins that were exposing all of their surface polymerize into stock-like proteins

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:50.920
 that have less surface exposure and the water becomes more like plain bulk water under the tough surface.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:59.920
 This water then behaves very differently and that's the kind of water that is involved in cell swelling,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.920
 growth, uncontrolled cell division and so on.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:11.920
 It's also the pH inside the cell also regulates the protein's folding ability to a large degree

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.920
 that proteins don't conformationally fold properly in the wrong pH.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:28.920
 Yes, and in the case of any protein, jelly, even some synthetic plastics,

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:38.920
 the alkalinity has the same effect of making the jelly swell up and get watery and soft.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:45.920
 So again, another reason why the alkaline internal environment would not be helpful.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.920
 Yes.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.920
 Okay, good.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.920
 Inside the cell.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:49.920
 Inside the cell, yes.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:17:03.920
 Urea happens to be a strange kind of solvent that is pretty much equally at home inside and outside the cell

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.920
 but it's slightly more at home in a healthy stable cell.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:16.920
 So that just by solubility, if you immerse cells in a solution with a certain amount of urea,

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:22.920
 the urea is going to come to rest at a higher concentration in cells.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.920
 No pumping is involved.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:31.920
 It's simply that it's soluble in the cell at a slightly higher degree than in plain water.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:43.920
 And inside the cell, it participates with the relaxed or energized state of the cell in which surfaces is exposed.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:53.920
 So the urea helps the proteins to expose the energized surface that keeps cells in the functioning high energy state.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.920
 And that's how Denopolis helped with cancer was by injecting the urea into the cells

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.920
 and that helped them maintain their shape and function to a better degree.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:15.920
 And to keep it towards the slightly acidic metabolizing state in which it doesn't tend to proliferate

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:21.920
 or relatively slightly dehydrated effect.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:36.920
 So it's like you have now a new solvent solute substance when it has the right amount of urea mixed in with the proteins and fats and water.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:44.920
 It creates a new state of matter that has its own solubility properties for other things,

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:53.920
 including the preference for potassium over sodium and for magnesium over calcium and so on.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.920
 Right. So it's helping the mineral balance of the cell be more balanced.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:05.920
 Now, I think you also stated that urea itself is not an osmolite and it does not affect pH. Is that right?

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.920
 Yeah, that's been known for over 100 years.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:25.920
 People simply use the semi permeable membrane setup and found that it doesn't behave like sodium or potassium

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:36.920
 or other things that are known to be osmolites and to pool water across a semi permeable membrane and so on.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:45.920
 In 1914, I think it was the first one, but around the First World War,

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:55.920
 someone was demonstrating that you could make it five or six times more concentrated than it should be osmotically.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.920
 And it would be in balance and not cause cells to lose water.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:10.920
 It would hold the cell in the proper state where if you had five or six times the concentration of sugar or salt,

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.920
 you would dry up. You'd be in trouble.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:18.920
 When you put salt on the slug, it drinks it. Yeah, right. Takes all the water out of it.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.920
 OK. Presumably a slug wouldn't find concentrated urea.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.920
 Interesting. And I think you've also mentioned that that concentration five to six times

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:34.920
 is nothing as much as, say, a hundred times, which is still compatible with life.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.920
 It doesn't actually, it's not, has a very, very low toxicity. It's not at all toxic, is it?

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:49.920
 No. Sea organisms, sharks, for example, have a very, very high level of urea imbalance.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.920
 Is that right?

00:20:50.920 --> 00:21:01.920
 And experiments have shown that even more than a hundred times what we normally have doesn't cause any damage that can be seen in cells.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:16.920
 And therapeutically, Danopoulos and others have found that maybe a hundred times our normal urea level in the serum is actually therapeutic for certain things,

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:22.920
 cancer and brain function, for example.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:32.920
 Because I think there's quite a lot of references to urea from the "scientific" community that are not really interested in it

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.920
 or just trying to play it down as being irrelevant.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:45.920
 And they have urea analogs, I think, which are far more problematic that they would want to suggest or not even mention urea.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:53.920
 Sickle cell anemia, for example, was being treated successfully with urea.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:22:05.920
 And normal cells under stress tend to be hardened the way sickle cells become stiff and won't go through capillaries.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:18.920
 Just during heart surgery, the stress causes ordinary round blood cells to become stiffened and malfunction,

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.920
 tending to kill the patient.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:26.920
 And with a supplement of urea, that hardening of the red cells by stress is prevented.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.920
 And it was therapeutic for the sickle cell patients.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:43.920
 But because of the myth of urea being an osmolite, someone used plain urea at a certain concentration

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:50.920
 without the normal sodium and other minerals in the solution.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.920
 They found that it broke, immediately caused red blood cells to break down.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.920
 So they said, "That can't be good."

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:05.920
 They stopped using it and shifted over to very toxic carcinogenic hydroxyurea, which is still in use.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.920
 But you do know doctors that use this current day, right?

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:16.920
 There are publications currently recommending us to use hydroxyurea.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.920
 But did you mean using real urea?

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.920
 Yeah, I was meaning the real urea.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:30.920
 A few people are using it, for example, to prevent killing patients in heart surgery.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:35.920
 But it definitely isn't a well-recognized treatment.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:46.920
 Did I understand you correctly when you said that urea, in the absence of the other electrolytes, would have a negative effect?

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.920
 Yeah, it acts like distilled water as far as the osmotic property goes.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:57.920
 So it has to be osmotically balanced with the regular concentration of solutes that you'd normally find in blood.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:05.920
 It would take about six times as much urea as normal to not break down the red cells.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.920
 Interesting.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:14.920
 I'm not too sure what it is, but for example, just for people that are listening to understand the concept that I'm trying to describe to you

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:21.920
 and that you're describing to me, is that if you have, for example, a one millimolar concentration of urea in your blood normally,

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:29.920
 then if you were to inject a five or six millimolar concentration of urea into the capillary or into the artery or whatever,

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.920
 it wouldn't have a negative effect.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.920
 It would be acceptable.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:38.920
 But if it was injected as a one millimolar solution, which you'd find naturally in the blood, you'd have a problem with that.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:53.920
 Yeah, assuming that the other things like sodium and calcium and potassium aren't compensating for the difference in urea.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.920
 OK.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.920
 So what about taking it orally?

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:04.920
 That's been done also for over 100 years, treating heart failure.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:16.920
 And one person reported on, I think he said he had had heart failure patients doing well on oral urea for as long as nine years.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.920
 And this is because it's a diuretic and it's...

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:32.920
 Yeah, that was the argument that they were using it because it did relieve the swollen legs and such that occur in congestive heart failure.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:44.920
 But I think since you also see it bringing people back from brain damage and traumatic head injury and strokes and such,

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:56.920
 it I think has much deeper therapeutic effects, stabilizing cells in many ways, not just reducing the swelling by causing diuresis.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.920
 OK.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.920
 So I do ask you, Dr. Kamedi, 91.1 FM Garbovul.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:09.920
 This month, Dr. P is being questioned about his latest newsletter on urea.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:16.920
 I know we've mentioned urea and Greek physician Dr. Danopoulos several months back in his treatment of cancer.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:28.920
 But this month, we're going to be talking more about the other beneficial aspects of urea and certain other inflammatory conditions, dementia, cancer, etc.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:33.920
 We'll be bringing out some of the reasons how urea could actually be very helpful for this.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:41.920
 The number, if you live in the area, is 923-2513, 923-3911.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.920
 Or there is a toll-free number, which is 1-800-KAMED-RAD.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.920
 So from 7.30 till the end of the show, people are invited to call in with any questions.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.920
 It would be good if people could keep to the subject matter.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.920
 OK.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.920
 So anyway, the other question I wanted to ask you about the diuretic activity of urea,

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:10.920
 and you've mentioned it being useful in congestive heart failure and other edema-type water swelling situations because of its ability to mobilize water.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:19.920
 Do you have any comparisons, if you like, for traditional diuretics?

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:28.920
 I know that there used to be non-potassium sparing, and then they brought out these kind of loop diuretics that were potassium sparing.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.920
 I mean the common furosemide that's still used is not potassium sparing.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.920
 You have to take a potassium supplement with that.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:46.920
 How do you – are you able to answer that, whether you have any opinion about diuretics and use versus something like urea?

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:52.920
 Yeah, I have opinions, but I haven't finished thinking about the subject.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:28:05.920
 I mean, remember, mercury was a traditional diuretic, and it apparently worked just by sort of killing the tubes of the kidney and letting the water kind of fall out of the body.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.920
 Not to be recommended.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.920
 Well, and like, you know, radiation was useful for treating psoriasis.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.920
 X-rays were useful for treating psoriasis and arthritis, right?

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:25.920
 Yeah, and I think some of the chemical diuretics are about as well-founded as mercury and diuretic.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:35.920
 Chemicals that made the kidneys give up more water don't necessarily really improve the person's health.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.920
 Right.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.920
 The cells could be still holding onto the water and not –

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:57.920
 Yeah, and besides stress, for example, in heart surgery, it involves water retention, failure of the kidney function,

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:06.920
 leading to things like hardening of the red blood cells and stiffening of the capillaries and so on.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:16.920
 But any stress involves a series of reactions, all of which relate to the way cells handle water.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:28.920
 Nitric oxide is a universally produced thing by injury and stress, and it causes de-energizing and swelling of cells.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:39.920
 And estrogen is a physiological producer of swelling, imitating a stress reaction and being produced by stress.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:47.920
 And one of the brain or pituitary hormones, antidiuretic hormone,

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:54.920
 is another stress-induced producer of water retention and edema.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:30:01.920
 And old people, as well as traumatized people who are hospitalized,

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:08.920
 fairly often develop a state of water retention with sodium loss.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:17.920
 They call it hyponatremia or the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:31.920
 But estrogen happens to produce the same effect, and so they say estrogen activates the receptors of the antidiuretic hormone.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:41.920
 When you can't find the actual hormone, but the same conditions, they say it's because the receptors are acting independently.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:54.920
 And nitric oxide, estrogen, and antidiuretic hormone produce the state of getting waterlogged while losing sodium into the urine

00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:07.920
 and producing fairly concentrated urine, but keeping overhydrated cells and blood supply.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:19.920
 And the normal basic thing that regulates the ability to release water through the kidneys while retaining sodium

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:34.920
 is the particular energized electronic state of the cells governing the way the tube of the kidney electrically relates to its surroundings.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:44.920
 The production of carbon dioxide and carbonic acid, the carbonic anhydrase enzyme,

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:51.920
 is one of the targets of some of the diuretics, such as acetosolamide,

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:59.920
 so that the body retains more carbon dioxide and doesn't lose so much sodium.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:10.920
 And the normal regulator of carbon dioxide and so of sodium water balance is the thyroid hormone.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:23.920
 And hypothyroid people always tend towards this syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:33.920
 or the appearance of simply hyponatremia, of being waterlogged, having enough water, not enough sodium.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:44.920
 So the sodium itself, sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate, can cure a lot of these stress conditions.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:51.920
 Do you think the same waterlogging could be borne out in things like a boggy intestine or a swollen intestine

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:59.920
 that fails to move food along properly and contributes to endotoxin reabsorption because of the inefficient movement?

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:09.920
 Yeah, the intestine is especially exposed to things such as endotoxin, which release nitric oxide,

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:17.920
 which has this de-energizing cell swelling effect, waterlogging effect.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:25.920
 So bicarbonate of sodium, you mentioned just before I interrupted there, would be another good way of liberating CO2

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.920
 and taken internally would have a local topical activity too.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:39.920
 And surprisingly, even sodium chloride has a diuretic effect in most people.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:48.920
 And when you use the baking soda, the kidneys are able to retain as much sodium as they want,

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:54.920
 but the bicarbonate can be changed back into carbon dioxide,

00:33:54.920 --> 00:34:04.920
 and it can actually help to acidify cells on the inside while maintaining the sodium on the outside.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:11.920
 So that's something people can just swallow by the quarter teaspoon or half teaspoon mixed with water?

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:19.920
 Yeah. I know people who have taken a teaspoon two or three times a day with water for many years.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:26.920
 Athletes sometimes take a tablespoon with water before an endurance race.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:37.920
 And I think part of the effect on endurance is more basic than just preventing getting waterlogged.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:43.920
 I think it's actually helping to prevent excess nitric oxide production.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:55.920
 Am I not right in thinking that the endurance runners, marathon runners, some of these people collapsing from cardiac arrest are hyponatremic,

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.920
 so they suddenly get low sodium?

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:05.920
 Yeah, I think that's probably the most common reason for endurance runners collapsing and dying.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:12.920
 Okay. Well, you're listening to Ask Your Ob Doctor, KMUD Galvepool 91.1 FM, and from now until 8 o'clock,

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:18.920
 you're invited to call in with any questions surrounding this month's continuing topic of urea

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:26.920
 and its treatment in such things as cardiac illnesses, dementia, cancer, and we'll get into a few others here later on.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:35.920
 The number is, like I said, 93391 or 3911, or if you live outside the area, there's a 1-800 number, which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:43.920
 So going on to aging seems a little bit just indistinct, perhaps, from this month's subject.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:53.920
 But in terms of the concept of hydration and skin and the appearance of skin and the water content of cells,

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:59.920
 not necessarily being helpful, but being more detrimental and in a low-energy state,

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:10.920
 I wanted you to just discuss the idea of young babies and newborns and young teenagers and young adults

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:16.920
 having a kind of a fairly plump, healthy skin that's fairly thick.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:24.920
 I don't want to confuse that with the skin being boggy, because that would seem to imply that there's too much water in the cells.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:30.920
 But in terms of the aging and youth and the skin's appearance and the production of keratin,

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:35.920
 which is that kind of flaky layer that may be more associated with older people,

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:44.920
 is there anything perhaps that can be done to improve the quality of the skin that would be related to water?

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:59.920
 The plumpness is largely the water content of any cell, all the way from a fertilized ovum all the way to a 100-year-old person.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:12.920
 The cell water content decreases pretty steadily with aging until an old cell, which is still very functional,

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:21.920
 no disease evident, is pretty dried up relative to the 92% water of fertilized ovum.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:35.920
 It gets down to something like 65% water in old cells as a steady progression without any particular disease happening.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:52.920
 As that happens, cell division is slowed so that in your skin, over time, you see fewer cells in the skin, meaning that it's thinner.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:59.920
 There just isn't as much living skin there in old people.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:12.920
 There's a column of growing cells in the surface layer, the squamous epithelium of skin and mucous membranes.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:18.920
 There's a column of eight or ten growing cells in the young skin,

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:25.920
 and only maybe two or three cells that are still actively growing in old skin.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:36.920
 That's partly just because they're slowing down, but they're also -- the piling up collapsed,

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:44.920
 cornified, or keratinized cells accumulate in the old skin.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:58.920
 The maturing process comes on prematurely with aging or with some types of stress.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:07.920
 For example, a vitamin A deficiency will cause premature keratinizing or hardening of the skin,

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:18.920
 and the skin will become thinner and tougher, lower water content.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:25.920
 Estrogen does this normally cyclically in the mucous membranes,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:35.920
 causing at first a faster growth because there's a greater water uptake under the influence of estrogen.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.920
 There's a rapid thickening and growing,

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:46.920
 but then an increased formation of keratin fibers and hardening of the surface.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:53.920
 So some of the effects of estrogen are just like vitamin A deficiency,

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:59.920
 and you can offset some of the effects both of aging and estrogen

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:06.920
 by simply supplementing some vitamin A and vitamin E directly into the skin.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:13.920
 And urea, old skin has much less urea in it than young skin,

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:23.920
 and that's probably both the cause and effect of the lower water content with aging.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.920
 We do have another call -- not another. We have the first call on the line.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:31.920
 Let me hold you there, Dr. Pete, if you don't mind, and let's take this next call and see where we're going.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.920
 Hi, caller. You're on there. Where are you from?

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:34.920
 I'm from White Thorn.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:35.920
 Okay. Hi.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:41.920
 Hi. My dad is in the hospital right now with CHF and dementia

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.920
 and also interactions between his medicine for the most --

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:53.920
 for the diuretic and gabapentin and one for his heart, too.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:59.920
 But his lactic acid was normal, but the creatinine was not normal,

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:10.920
 and I'm wondering if the oil urea would be better for him to take with -- and not take the furosemide.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.920
 Dr. Pete --

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:19.920
 You can find articles about the use of urea in heart failure

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:24.920
 and comparing it to other diuretics on PubMed, for example.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:30.920
 If you put in urea heart failure, you can find the articles on PubMed.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.920
 Okay. Thank you.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:37.920
 So would that be something he could use orally?

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:44.920
 It's very tasteless, a little maybe on the salty side,

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:52.920
 so it's usually taken with orange juice or grapefruit juice just so you don't taste it.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:57.920
 A small amount, anywhere from a fourth of a teaspoon to a glass,

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.920
 up to maybe a teaspoon per glass.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:01.920
 Okay. Good.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:08.920
 Would it be okay to take that with his diuretic he has already prescribed?

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:15.920
 I don't think it interferes with the diuretics, but it just makes them unnecessary.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.920
 Okay. Well, that's good to hear.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.920
 I thank you for helping me.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.920
 All right. Thanks for your call.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.920
 We've got two more callers on the air, so let's take the next caller.

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.920
 Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.920
 Yes. Hello. Philipsville.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.920
 Oh, hi.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:43.920
 Yes, I would like to know what one should ingest to make the cells more acidic on the inside

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:50.920
 and the blood better, you know, more alkaline on the outside, like you're saying is good for you.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.920
 You say that ingesting this urea is good.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.920
 Getting adequate protein in your diet is probably the thing that most people

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.920
 would make the biggest difference with.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.920
 Oh.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.920
 That increases urea, you're saying, Dr. Peet?

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:14.920
 Yes. You can measure the increased output of urea in the urine in proportion to the amount of protein

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:19.920
 you're eating if your digestion is good and if your thyroid function is good.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.920
 So eating red meat is good for that?

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:27.920
 It shouldn't be too high in phosphate. Meat is very high in phosphate.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:28.920
 Oh.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.920
 And so gelatin is good as a supplement.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:41.920
 If you make soup with the collagenous joint tissue, for example.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.920
 Like oxtail or shank?

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.920
 Oxtail, yes.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:49.920
 Do you recommend then just eating a little bit of meat and not too much?

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:55.920
 Yes, I think it's better to get a big part of your protein from other foods such as --

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:56.920
 Like what?

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:05.920
 Eggs, milk, and cheese and some of the high-quality vegetables like potatoes and mushrooms.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.920
 Eggs, milk, and cheese, potatoes, mushrooms, those are some high-protein --

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.920
 Are eggs good?

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.920
 Yes.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.920
 Eggs are very good.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:16.920
 Okay. And you mentioned sodium chloride. That's salt.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:23.920
 Is salt good for your heart or for your blood or what were you talking about?

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.920
 You know, putting salt in your food good?

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.920
 There are some articles on my website about salt.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.920
 You can use the little search device on the website to find --

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.920
 I don't have a computer.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:42.920
 Oh. Yeah, salting your food to taste is the best way to tell.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.920
 And that will keep your kidneys functioning better?

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.920
 Yeah.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:54.920
 And in people who are under stress, for example, women with toxemia of pregnancy --

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.920
 Well, what about just in general, just normal, you know, aging

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:03.920
 and wanting to keep as healthy as you can when you're getting older?

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:11.920
 I've known many young women and a few old people who have been put on a low-sodium diet

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:20.920
 because of various problems, and using the studies on pregnant toxemia people,

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.920
 I suggested that they try the same thing.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.920
 Now, what about potassium? What does that do for you?

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.920
 I know low potassium isn't good.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.920
 Too much potassium can slow your heart rate, but the right amount,

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.920
 such as having lots of fruit and vegetables,

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:46.920
 potassium tends to protect against high blood pressure, relaxing blood vessels.

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.920
 So as you were saying, Dr. Peet, you were saying that using the studies they did

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:54.920
 with the pregnant women, you can apply the same principle to aging?

00:45:54.920 --> 00:46:01.920
 Yeah. I saw the same problems existing in women in their 20s and 30s

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:12.920
 and men in their 60s, 70s, and 80s having a variety of inflammatory high blood pressure symptoms and such,

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.920
 and I suggested that they salt their food to taste instead of --

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.920
 Low-sodium diet.

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:23.920
 Yes, I know there's a lot of controversy about salt, and we've been taught a lot that salt is bad,

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:28.920
 it causes high blood pressure, it causes water retention, so you don't think that's true.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.920
 Well, we've just proven that, and they only started saying you shouldn't eat salt

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.920
 when they wanted to sell their diuretics, so it's just been one big scam.

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:42.920
 Okay. Well, I've had one cardiologist tell me not to eat salt,

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.920
 although she didn't want to give me a diuretic, and the other one said,

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:49.920
 "Yes, eat salt because it'll keep up your blood volume, and that's probably good for you."

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:55.920
 Yeah, the blood volume gets oxygen and nutrients to the kidneys and keeps them working.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.920
 So hydration is very important.

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.920
 But what about the first question I asked about the cells,

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.920
 to make sure that the inner cells are acidic enough?

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:05.920
 Well, that was the protein.

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.920
 That's why he suggested the protein, because that will keep the urea up.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:13.920
 Okay. So eat protein, eat salt, but not too much meat.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:20.920
 I know that there was a -- gout is supposed to be caused by eating too much meat.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.920
 I'm not sure what gout is.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:27.920
 Well, doctors aren't too sure what it is either, but the essential thing --

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:34.920
 people can have a lot of uric acid crystals in their body without having any symptoms at all.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:44.920
 It seems to be endotoxin from an inflamed intestine getting deposited on the crystals of uric acid,

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.920
 causing these symptoms.

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:51.920
 So we want to have urea, but not uric crystal?

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:52.920
 Uric acid.

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.920
 Yeah, urea is protective uric acid.

00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:03.920
 Okay. So by eating a proper amount of protein is the good thing to do for that, you're saying?

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:04.920
 Yeah.

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:05.920
 Okay. All right. Thank you very much.

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.920
 Thank you for your call.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:10.920
 Okay. We do have another caller on the line, so let's take this next caller.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.920
 Caller, where are you from?

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:13.920
 Willow Creek.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.920
 Hi. What's your question?

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:25.920
 Okay. I've had water retention problems ever since I was pregnant with my first child.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:31.920
 And I do have an underactive thyroid, and they always tell me not to eat any salt.

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:40.920
 And then I went to a healer like a few months ago, and he told me that I should use this --

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:44.920
 it's a salt from France, I forget what it's called.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:53.920
 But anyway, so I did, but I was still swelling up, and I'm on diuretics.

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.920
 How much thyroid are you using?

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.920
 How much what?

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.920
 How much thyroid. Did you say you were using thyroid?

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.920
 Oh, yeah, thyroid pills, yeah.

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:09.920
 I think like, I don't know, 100 milligrams or something, one gram.

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.920
 Levothyroxine.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.920
 And you said that you --

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.920
 Levothyroxine.

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.920
 You said that you had water retention since your first child.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.920
 Yes.

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:19.920
 How many years since?

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.920
 My first pregnancy. That was 45 years ago.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.920
 45 years ago. Dr. P?

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:30.920
 Yeah, so I've had it all these years, and my mom had it, and so did my grandmother.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:38.920
 For quite a while, it's been known that estrogen interferes with the conversion of levothyroxine

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:48.920
 into the active hormone, and that accounts for why women have about five times as much thyroid problems as men do

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:52.920
 because of the interference of estrogen with activating it.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:50:07.920
 And so, illogically, doctors prescribe thyroxine to women without measuring the liver function of producing the active hormone T3.

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.920
 Uh-huh, yeah, I don't think I've ever had a test for that.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:20.920
 It sounds like you're not using the right kind of hormone, so the levothyroxine that you're on --

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.920
 It's just T4.

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:23.920
 -- is probably being blocked.

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:27.920
 The conversion of it to the active hormone is more than likely getting blocked because of high estrogen,

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:33.920
 so you'd be better off using a T3 supplement, which does not need you to perform the conversion.

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:40.920
 So you're probably still a low thyroid, even though you're taking thyroid hormone, because you're not converting it.

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:45.920
 Yeah, well, according to their tests, I'm normal now on the levothyroxine.

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:51.920
 Yeah, there's a lot of controversy about the thyroid test, the TSH that's used as a measurement.

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:58.920
 It's very poor science, and whilst the TSH may be in the range, you probably find it's on the higher end,

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:05.920
 and naturally your temperature and pulses would be much more indicative of your thyroid performance.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.920
 Oh, what do you mean by temperature, high or low?

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:11.920
 Probably low temperature and falling temperatures.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:12.920
 I tend to have a low temperature.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:18.920
 And then obviously things like stubborn weight gain, lack of energy, insomnia.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.920
 Very lack of energy. It's gotten worse this year.

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:22.920
 Yeah.

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:23.920
 Low pulse.

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:28.920
 Very bad. And I went to the doctors for it, and they said they can't find any problem.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:34.920
 Well, it's probably just that you're not turning the thyroid you're taking into an active form that your body can use.

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:39.920
 So that's probably the base problem, and that's very common to occur after pregnancy.

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:44.920
 So if I wanted to get that test, do I have to ask my doctor to do it for me? Do I have to request it?

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:50.920
 Yeah, you could, but like you said, you're probably falling within the reference range for supposedly normal,

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:54.920
 but actually your physiology and your symptoms are far from.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:59.920
 So I'm not too sure how relevant getting another blood test would be.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.920
 I think more relevantly would be if you were to take your temperature and pulses.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:07.920
 It's a little bit outside the scope of this radio show because we do have other callers calling.

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:12.920
 But if you wanted to, you can always contact us outside of business hours.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.920
 I can discuss with you how you would take this, and you can see for yourself whether or not your metabolism is--

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.920
 Okay, so I would go on the website then for that?

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:26.920
 No, you can call us Monday through Friday. I'll give the number out at the end of the show.

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.920
 Okay, thank you.

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.920
 Okay, you're welcome. Okay, we have another caller on the air, so let's take this next caller.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.920
 Thank you for your call.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:36.920
 Hi, you're on the air, and where are you from?

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.920
 Yes, hello?

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.920
 Yeah, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:52.920
 Yes, hello. I'm from Bellevue, Idaho, and my question is, is drinking your own urine a good way to get urea?

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.920
 Dr. Payne.

00:52:54.920 --> 00:53:00.920
 I know quite a few people who have done it and seem to be very healthy,

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:05.920
 and it's been practiced for about 3,000 or 4,000 years.

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:20.920
 But I don't know how pleasant it--I think most people would prefer to use the purified chemical rather than their own urine.

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:32.920
 There's a funny video of a man in India who is preparing products from cow urine.

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:39.920
 It's a very common folk remedy around the world.

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:49.920
 So there you go. If you don't fancy the idea of consuming your own urine, you can use urea as a purified form.

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.920
 Did you--okay, I'm not too sure if the caller is still there.

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.920
 Anyway, that was the answer. Thank you for your question, caller.

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.920
 I don't know if you can hear us still, but I appreciate you calling in.

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.920
 So, yeah, it's six minutes to, if anybody wants to get a quick question,

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:09.920
 excuse me, either welcome, 923-3911 if you're in the area, or the 1-800 number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:17.920
 So, Dr. Payne, let's just quickly talk about psoriasis and urea and inflammatory bowel disease,

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:22.920
 given that there is a kind of parallel between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:27.920
 in terms of the inflammation aspect of degenerative conditions

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:35.920
 and urea's use in both psoriasis and possibly with inflammatory bowel disorder.

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.920
 And eczema. It's used in eczema.

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:45.920
 And eczema, right, because the science shows that urea actually blocks--

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.920
 sorry, I was thinking about tumor necrosis factor. That was it.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:57.920
 And curcuma. So in turmeric, it blocks-- the active compound curcumin blocks tumor necrosis factor,

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:02.920
 and that is implicated in a lot of inflammatory conditions of which skin disorders

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:06.920
 and inflammatory bowel disease could be exacerbated or even caused by.

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.920
 Do you have any--

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:19.920
 Well, one thing to consider when you have both bowel and skin symptoms is that the bowel is actually causing

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:27.920
 or contributing to the skin problem and eliminating gluten, for example,

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:36.920
 sometimes clears up both the bowel and skin problem because some of the same enzymes are activated by inflammation

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:44.920
 that cause the premature hardening and flakiness of the skin in psoriasis.

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:53.920
 That same process is activated by gluten and other inflammation-producing agents in the intestine.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:56:07.920
 The process of psoriasis is an accelerated cell division, which is probably caused by the overhydration

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:15.920
 and possibly lack of the right balance of estrogen, progesterone, and thyroid,

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:20.920
 and maybe a deficiency of vitamin A, which is a restraining influence.

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.920
 Or vitamin D, right?

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:28.920
 Yeah, both vitamin D and A can restrain the rate of multiplication.

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:38.920
 And besides having a very fast cell division in psoriasis, it divides quickly a few times

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:47.920
 and then prematurely ages and collapses into the flaky, horny, dry condition.

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:58.920
 And urea has been demonstrated to delay or prevent that premature hardening process

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:12.920
 by governing the expression of the genes so that the senility-producing proteins aren't produced so early.

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:26.920
 And keeping the cell in a vital state longer and delaying both the replication and the premature aging.

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:30.920
 So it sounds like urea can be injected, or doctors are injecting it into cancer cells.

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.920
 It can be injected into the bloodstream.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:40.920
 It can be rubbed on topically for skin conditions, and it can be taken orally.

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:48.920
 Yeah, there are creams available on the Internet, at drugstores and so on,

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:53.920
 containing anything from 5% to 40% urea.

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:57.920
 40% is almost a concentrated solution,

00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:11.920
 and it's very effective for treating several ichthyosis and psoriasis, various skin conditions.

00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:22.920
 And some doctors and pharmacists might tell you that it's used to remove toenails or to remove dead tissue and so on.

00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:30.920
 And so they all scare you and say that because you can remove calluses with it, it must be dangerous to good skin.

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:38.920
 But the 40% solutions are very soothing and therapeutic.

00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:46.920
 It is now widely used for treating the skin inflammation of breast cancer patients

00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:53.920
 who have been exposed to so much x-ray that the skin has been damaged,

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:59.920
 and it prevents the inflammation and fibrosis produced by x-rays.

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:08.920
 And it's also the topical skin creams of urea are also very similar in action to how Comfrey works with the allantoin.

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:14.920
 We've got about a minute left, so I really need to hold it right there so we don't get too overextended.

00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:16.920
 Dr. Pete, thanks so much for your time.

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.920
 I really appreciate you giving your time the way you do as freely as you do.

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:23.920
 And let me just tell people how they can find more out about you.

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:24.920
 OK, thank you.

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.920
 OK, good night.

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:28.920
 OK, for those people who've listened, thanks so much for listening.

00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:34.920
 We always appreciate questions.

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:38.920
 It lets us know that people are out there listening apart from anything else.

00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:46.920
 OK, so for people that want to find out more about Dr. Pete, www.raypete.com, R-A-Y-P-E-T,
