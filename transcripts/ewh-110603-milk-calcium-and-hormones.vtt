 Club Hope Radio.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:44.680
 You're listening to Holistic Living, brought to you by EastWest Healing and Performance.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.680
 And now, here are your hosts, Josh and Jeanne Rubin.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.680
 [Music]

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:03.680
 Welcome everyone. This is Josh Rubin from EastWest Healing and Performance.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.680
 Jeanne and Ray will be joining us in a couple minutes.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 Just want to welcome everyone to another show.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.680
 It's been a little bit of trouble getting Ray back on, but I think the break was good.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.680
 And I think we get a good show ahead of us on milk, calcium and hormones in the body.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.680
 It's such a big topic.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680
 And of course, like always, we could probably chat forever.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.680
 But we got Ray anyway from 60 to 120 minutes.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.680
 It's going to be a great show.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.680
 We will be taking callers towards the end.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.680
 The call-in number is 347-426-3546.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.680
 And all I ask of everyone is if you do ask questions, please keep the questions per the topic of the show.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.680
 And try to keep the questions more pertaining to the show and just general information rather than just personal self-diagnostics.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.680
 Because we don't know enough to really help you.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.680
 And sometimes we're just going to keep going down the endless path and we want to take as many callers.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.680
 So just keep that in mind.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.680
 If you want to learn more about Ray Peat, you can visit the website at RayPeat.com.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.680
 Www.RayPeat.com.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.680
 Ray has got a Ph.D. in biology from the University of Oregon.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.680
 He specializes in physiology.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.680
 He's taught at many schools around the U.S.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.680
 It was from Oregon to Montana as well as teaching in Mexico and as well as doing a lot of private nutritional counseling.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.680
 He actually started his work with progesterone-related hormones back in 1968.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 So Ray has been doing this for a while.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.680
 And as you know from reading his articles and books and listening to him, he's quite the genius, a humble genius at that.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.680
 So if you want to learn more about him, visit his site.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.680
 He's got a lot of great articles on his site that you can print out and read.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.680
 He's also got a newsletter that you can subscribe to.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.680
 It's about, I don't know, $28 for 12 issues and it depends on where you live.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.680
 But he's actually held off on that or I think the books as well because of the volume of e-mails and orders that he's getting.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.680
 So just be a little patient.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.680
 And at the same time, like we've always talked about, a lot of people have been e-mailing Ray, which I think is great.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.680
 He loves his work.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.680
 But at the same time, mine, you know, he's got a life too.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.680
 And, you know, unfortunately money, you know, rules the world.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.680
 It's just how it goes.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.680
 So all we ask is if you're e-mailing him and e-mailing him and e-mailing him, please donate, you know, whether it's $5, $10, I don't know, $100.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.680
 We send him some money.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.680
 Just send him something just to say thanks for all the help that he's been giving him.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.680
 Let's say just because you're listening to the show you have to send him money.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.680
 But if you're doing a lot of dialogue via e-mail with him, you're still taking up time and unfortunately time is money.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.680
 So just donate something.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.680
 And a lot of people hear me incorrectly and say, "Well, I don't have $100."

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.680
 You can send $5.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.680
 It's the thought that really counts.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.680
 So please keep that in mind.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.680
 You can learn more about us at our website at eastwesthealing.com.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.680
 Our website is getting a huge overhaul right now from content to upgrades.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.680
 So in the next three months it's going to be changing dramatically.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.680
 We're going to have some product on there, some programs, a lot of great new things going on.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.680
 We have a lot of great new things going on with our business.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.680
 Keep in mind we consult physically and nutritionally with clients all over the world, you name a country.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.680
 We pretty much have a client there and we get great success.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.680
 So feel free to give us a call.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.680
 And keep in mind there's other practitioners all over the world.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.680
 You know, it's really about finding the practitioner that works for you, your personality, your needs.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680
 So keep that in mind.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.680
 But feel free to check out our website and feel free to give us a call.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.680
 So today's show is on milk, calcium, and hormones.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.680
 We're going to be talking about dairy, the degradation of it, where it comes from,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.680
 why Ray recommends so much of it in his philosophies based on a lot of work that he's done.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.680
 Talk about calcium.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.680
 We'll talk about blood labs, parathyroid hormone, how do we keep those levels regulated to downregulate inflammation,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.680
 and maybe if we get too much calcium what that can cause,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.680
 and correlate this with inflammation in the hormonal system in our body.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.680
 So it's going to be a great show.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.680
 We've got a lot of questions for Ray.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.680
 And like I said, it's been a while, so I think he's got a lot to add to the show.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.680
 I'm just waiting for Jeanne and Ray to pop on so I can pull them in.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.680
 Our next show, we don't have it scheduled yet.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.680
 I emailed Ray and asked him to -- if we could do a July show,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.680
 and hopefully we can schedule it because a lot of people have been emailing us

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.680
 and really would like a show on serotonin, tryptophan, and endotoxin,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.680
 and how that affects our gut, our behavior, psychology, and stuff like that.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.680
 So I'm hoping we get a show scheduled for July.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.680
 Don't forget, of course, to check out our Blog Talk Radio show page.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.680
 That's blogtalkradio.com/eastwesthealing, and you can check out what our next shows are.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.680
 As well as you can Facebook us.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.680
 You can look up my name, Joshua Rubin, or Jeanne Rubin,

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.680
 and you can follow a lot of the posts that we put on Facebook in regards to the information that we put,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.680
 the articles, the YouTubes, as well as we schedule our shows on there

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.680
 so you can keep up to date on when those shows are.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.680
 So I am running out of things to actually say, and you didn't call to listen to me talk.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.680
 You called to listen to Ray.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.680
 But I'm still waiting for them to come on so I can call them in.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.680
 So we have to wait a couple minutes.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.680
 Oh, here we go.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.680
 Hold on.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.680
 Let me get them in there.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.680
 Hello, Jeanne and Ray.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.680
 Nope.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.680
 They dropped the call.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.680
 As you know with this stuff, there can be technical difficulties.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.680
 Keep in mind, I just wanted to bring something up, and of course, this is my show,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.680
 and this is my perceptions, but remember that when we're educating you,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.680
 and Ray's educating, I should say, we're not telling you what to do.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.680
 He's sharing with you his philosophies.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.680
 That's all he's doing.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.680
 I don't do this show for my personal gain.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.680
 I do it 100% so he can have a platform to share his philosophies,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.680
 and it's not a place for him to defend himself.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.680
 This is a place for him to actually share, so keep that in mind as we do this,

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.680
 and I encourage you to reach out to e-mails and say, "Can Ray defend this?

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.680
 Can Ray defend that?"

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.680
 That's not the place for this.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.680
 This is supposed to be a sharing place.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.680
 Here we go.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.680
 Let's get them on.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.680
 Hi, Josh.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.680
 All righty, Ray, you there, Jeanne?

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.680
 Yes.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.680
 Hi.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.680
 How's it going, Ray?

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.680
 Okay.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.680
 Good.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.680
 So today, did you want to add anything before we start the show in regards to maybe yourself

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.680
 or in regards to the show topic?

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.680
 Oh, no.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:46.680
 I've been interested in milk for a long time, probably 55 years or so.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:55.680
 I've been studying what's going on with the cultural antagonisms to it.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.680
 Right.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:05.680
 It was in the '50s when the government had been collecting samples of organisms from around the world

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.680
 to monitor the effects of the atom bomb tests,

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:15.680
 and they wanted to know how it was accumulating in young people,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.680
 and so they started collecting baby teeth,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:27.680
 and the isotope that concentrated most in teeth happened to be strontium-90.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:38.680
 And then after they had been doing that for years, it came out that strontium-90 was causing leukemia in children,

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.680
 among other cancers.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:50.680
 But when that got into the news, people said, "Well, baby teeth show the radioactive isotope,

00:08:50.680 --> 00:09:02.680
 which is similar to calcium, and milk is rich in calcium, and milk is probably the main place babies are getting their strontium-90."

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:13.680
 So a whole wave went through the culture for a few years, advising people not to drink milk because of the strontium-90 in it.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:23.680
 But already in the 1950s, '56 or '57, people had analyzed the composition of diets

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:34.680
 and found that the fallout into the soil produced quite a high ratio of strontium-90 to available calcium,

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:46.680
 but plants extracted the calcium since that was what their cells needed and left behind a good proportion of the strontium.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:55.680
 And then when cows ate the vegetation, they again extracted a high proportion of calcium and left out a lot of strontium.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:07.680
 And so when you add up the essential nutrients, if you get them from vegetable matter rather than milk,

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:14.680
 you're getting extremely high concentrations of the fallout isotopes.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:25.680
 And milk is a good filtering process to eliminate all kinds of contaminants, especially in a period of high radiation.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:31.680
 It filters out the radioactive isotopes.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.680
 So I guess it's a huge topic. I mean, there's so many people that say, "Well, stay away from it because we're not cows.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.680
 We shouldn't drink cow's milk." And there's other people that say, "Well, you should only drink raw milk.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:49.680
 Pastured milk is so bad." I guess we need to rewind it a little bit and say, "Of course, your philosophy is you believe it's very beneficial."

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:56.680
 I mean, why do you think, looking at milk, I think the biggest topic is allergies.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.680
 Everyone says, "Oh, I'm intolerant to milk." And the same thing with other foods.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.680
 Why do you think there's so much degradation of milk itself, and why are we seeing so many of these allergies,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.680
 and why are people so afraid of it?

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:17.680
 Actually, the United States cleaned up the commercial dairy industry 40 or 50 years ago,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:28.680
 cut out the use of the most dangerous insecticides that had been getting into the milk

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.680
 and were known to cause breast cancer and other things.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:44.680
 But in the '60s, the Environmental Protection Agency and FDA banned the use of these insecticides around cows and dairies,

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:52.680
 and they controlled somewhat the additives going into the cow food.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:12:02.680
 Israel was quite a bit slower than the U.S. to ban one of these insecticides in particular,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:09.680
 but when they did in the '60s, their breast cancer rate plunged tremendously.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:18.680
 But the U.S., on that particular issue, had been leading the world in cleaning up the milk supply,

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.680
 and that was far ahead of cleaning up the meat supply.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:37.680
 So when you look at agricultural industry in general, the dairy is still probably the cleanest food available.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:44.680
 Bill, one part of your milk article in regards to like -- I think it's in regards to what they're feeding animals,

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.680
 and it was kind of something I want you to clarify because it didn't really make sense,

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.680
 and I don't even know if I'm going to pronounce the word correctly.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.680
 But you talked about plants, and you talked about when plants are stressed, they produce these enzymes.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.680
 How do you pronounce it, chitinases or chitinase?

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.680
 Or chitinase.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.680
 Chitinase, okay.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.680
 Can you elaborate that on that a little bit in regards to dairy?

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:14.680
 Well, it's something you find in lots of foods that are grown in stressed plants.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:27.680
 That's a plant enzyme that is protective against insects in particular, but it is strongly allergenic to any animal.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:35.680
 And in small amounts, it's produced in a stressed animal under the influence of estrogen.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:45.680
 So it's possible that that's a factor in meat and eggs and milk, but probably not in a practical sense.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:58.680
 The main allergens that get into the milk are, for example, if they let cows graze on pastures that have lots of allergenic weeds,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:06.680
 that will go right into the milk, enough of the allergens that people can react.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:16.680
 You can usually taste the funny food in the milk if you go around the cow's pasture and see what it's eating

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.680
 and squeeze some of the leaves.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:26.680
 You'll often identify what it is that gives the milk a funny flavor.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:32.680
 And some small dairies aren't very alert to what their cows are eating,

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:44.680
 and that can cause just an individual dairy's milk to be more allergenic than average.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:50.680
 Now, going back to the intolerances, because we know from our business, everyone's like, "Oh, I'm intolerant to dairy.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.680
 I'm intolerant to dairy. I've got a runny nose. I've done a lab, yada, yada, yada."

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.680
 I saw you talk about how even the day of the lab having a severe blood sugar handling issue,

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.680
 or if you have a damaged metabolism, you can't regulate blood sugar.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.680
 That can actually create the mechanism in the GI system to create the intolerance.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:14.680
 Can you talk about that a little bit and the validity of the food intolerance lab in regards to dairy?

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:30.680
 The tests for allergens are really just a very vague indicator of the fact that your immune system reacts to everything you are exposed to.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:40.680
 And usually, finding the antibodies to a particular substance means that you have become tolerant to that substance.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:45.680
 So I just don't pay any attention to the lab tests for allergies.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:52.680
 But the intestine adjusts its enzymes within just a few weeks.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:16:00.680
 Probably, usually it only takes two weeks to have a complete adaptation of the digestive enzymes.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:09.680
 But until your intestine has adjusted its enzymes to a new kind of diet,

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:19.680
 much of that food is going to be undigested and it will feed bacteria rather than feeding the person.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:31.680
 And the strange new growth of bacteria will produce lots of chemicals that can be toxic and allergenic.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:37.680
 And so if a person isn't used to eating vegetables and they eat vegetables,

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:46.680
 they'll often get a sore throat and runny nose, sore joints, headaches, and so on.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:55.680
 And it's much of the food sensitivity issues just adapting too suddenly to a diet,

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:02.680
 failing to adapt when they change because they do it too suddenly.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.680
 So you're saying when somebody introduces milk back into the diet to take it very,

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.680
 very slowly for the purpose of allowing the body to adapt.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.680
 Yeah.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:17.680
 Even if a person does have lactose intolerance from a lactase deficiency,

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:24.680
 tests of that have found that if they drink a cup per meal or less,

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:34.680
 they don't have the diarrhea that could be produced by drinking a pint of milk on an empty stomach.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:43.680
 And even if they have had biopsies that show a deficiency of the lactase enzyme,

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:52.680
 that can be induced in about two weeks just by introducing an occasional small amount of milk with their diet.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:18:03.680
 The enzymes -- the cells sense the presence of a nutrient and the enzymes are gradually induced

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:09.680
 until the intestine can then handle normal amounts.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:17.680
 And bacterial infections and inflammation can cause the loss of lactase enzymes

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.680
 and probably many other important digestive enzymes.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:31.680
 And experiments with supplementing thyroid or progesterone have found that you can induce

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:44.680
 or restore the lactase that has been deficient just by increasing those anti-stress hormones.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:50.680
 So, you know, does it have to do with their effect on, of course, increasing metabolism

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.680
 and helping to regulate blood sugar and downregulating estrogen

00:18:53.680 --> 00:19:00.680
 and helping to reestablish that small intestine integrity so you can break down the lactose?

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:06.680
 Because I know you talk about how hypothyroidism can decrease lactase production

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.680
 and causing a lactose "tolerance."

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:14.680
 The same thing how, you know, progesterone deficiency is actually seen with people that are lactose intolerant

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.680
 because they're not releasing lactase.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:26.680
 Yeah. Inflammation is probably the basic problem there.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:39.680
 Thyroid and progesterone, by restoring energy and normal function, bypass the inflammatory processes.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:46.680
 And inflammation shifts the cell function to an emergency state

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:56.680
 and you tend to lose a lot of functional enzymes in an inflamed state.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:05.680
 Right. So I guess in regards to dairy, maybe you could elaborate a little more.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:13.680
 You know, if we read your philosophies, you're probably more than anyone so heavy in regards to dairy.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:21.680
 Why do you feel dairy is so important and what are some of the benefits that people can get from eating or drinking dairy?

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:29.680
 Well, again, part of it, the biggest part is probably the alternatives.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:37.680
 Like 1960, the main focus against milk was its strontium-90 content.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:46.680
 But when you look at the alternatives, it turned out milk was the best food for avoiding strontium-90.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:54.680
 And it's the same with industrial additives, accidental pollutants.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:21:03.680
 Just about every place you look in the food industry, things are far worse than milk.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:13.680
 Some fruits, if you can find fruits that aren't grown in large-scale industrial orchards,

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:28.680
 bananas are an example of one of the worst products for chemical use and overproduction, bad soil, stressful conditions.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:45.680
 But if you can find unstressed fruits, those are very free of toxins and contaminants relative to most other food products.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.680
 You know, it would be safe to say in regards to dairy, you know, just for the public listening in,

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:55.680
 that it's kind of like a complete macronutrient because it's carb, it's protein, fat in a sense.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.680
 It's very balanced in regards to regulating blood sugar, downregulating inflammation.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:06.680
 It's got a lot of prothyroid and progesterone properties at the same time.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.680
 Yeah, it even contains some testosterone.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:18.680
 Thyroid, progesterone, and testosterone are important for the young animal.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:29.680
 In human milk, they found that there was enough thyroid hormone in human milk that babies whose thyroids were destroyed by living near

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:40.680
 and developing near a three-mile island during the accident, they didn't suffer any symptoms of hypothyroidism as long as they were being breastfed

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:48.680
 because of the high protective hormone content of the milk.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.680
 Yeah, you talk a lot about...

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.680
 Go ahead, Josh.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.680
 Go for it.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.680
 No, go for it.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.680
 No, I was just going to say, I mean, you know, you talk about the proteins, the fats, the hormones,

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.680
 all those really great things that milk has to offer us.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:08.680
 But one of the things that you stress the most is the calcium that it has to offer

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:22.680
 and how the calcium, the parathyroid, all these things work together in actually assisting the body in having normal levels of calcium with chronic stress,

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.680
 so on and so forth.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.680
 Can you elaborate on that a little bit for us and kind of...

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:32.680
 Yeah, that's really a subject for a week of seminars.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.680
 I can set it up, Ray.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.680
 I can set it up easily.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:42.680
 It involves everything at every level of the organism.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:56.680
 Calcium is potentially...it's the thing that causes all of the problems, allergies, cancer, heart attacks, and so on.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:04.680
 But when calcium is regulated properly, calcium protects against all of those things.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:13.680
 And one of the central things in regulating calcium is the parathyroid hormone.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:21.680
 And when you're deficient in calcium in your foods, your parathyroid hormone increases,

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:30.680
 and it can temporarily keep your blood calcium up to the proper level,

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.680
 and it does that by taking it out of the bones.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:43.680
 And when you eat an excess of calcium, that tends to suppress the parathyroid hormone.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:50.680
 And since they've been doing dialysis for kidney disease,

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:57.680
 that has been a way to get a better insight into how the parathyroid hormone works

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:03.680
 than had been done in just ordinary research.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:09.680
 They have found that if they remove the parathyroid hormone,

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.680
 the parathyroid gland entirely as far as they can,

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:21.680
 that they can solve many of the deadly effects of chronic kidney dialysis.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.680
 The hypertension and insomnia, for example,

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:34.680
 are two of the things that are immediately corrected by removing the parathyroid gland.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:45.680
 And when you look at the effects of the parathyroid hormone excess in such things as dialysis patients,

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:53.680
 you can get an idea of the range of things that eating extra calcium can correct

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.680
 by suppressing the parathyroid hormone.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.680
 Insomnia is just one of them.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:10.680
 Probably everywhere calcium is involved in an excitatory, inflammation-promoting way,

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:18.680
 you can probably reverse it most of the time just by increasing the calcium in your diet.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:31.680
 The two vitamins that are important for making the tissue handle calcium properly

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.680
 also contribute to lowering the parathyroid hormone.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:44.680
 Vitamin K and vitamin D help to handle the calcium

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:50.680
 so that the parathyroid gland senses it and shuts down.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:59.680
 And some other nutrients, for example, vitamin A and niacinamide,

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.680
 work in that same direction as vitamin K and vitamin D,

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:13.680
 helping to balance the ratio of calcium to phosphorus and restrain the parathyroid gland.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:20.680
 Foods, when they have put animals on a vitamin D deficient diet,

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:30.680
 they find that giving the animal sugar instead of starch will keep its bones from developing rickets.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:37.680
 It isn't that sugar has a vitamin D action, it's just that it lowers the stress

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:44.680
 and makes the animal adapt better to a vitamin D deficiency.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:51.680
 And if there's a calcium deficiency, letting the animal drink salty water

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.680
 for a long time will make up for a calcium deficiency in the diet

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:01.680
 by helping the kidneys to retain the calcium

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:08.680
 by substituting loss of sodium for loss of calcium.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.680
 So you mentioned supplements, and I kind of want to go back to that a little bit

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.680
 because, you know, based off a reading and hearing you speak,

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.680
 we know that parathyroid hormone, of course, is inflammatory

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.680
 and we need to downregulate and figure out why.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.680
 There's so many people out there listening that think because they did a lab

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.680
 and their calcium levels are low, they need to start pumping calcium

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.680
 and you're saying a little different, it has nothing to do with the calcium,

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.680
 I mean it does in a sense, but we need to downregulate parathyroid hormone first.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:42.680
 So what are the implications of just taking straight out calcium,

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.680
 can you take too much calcium, those things just for the listeners?

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:53.680
 I often see people with a blood calcium where it should be 9 or 10,

00:28:53.680 --> 00:29:00.680
 I see people with 11, 12, or 13 and getting them to eat more calcium,

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.680
 maybe take some vitamin D and vitamin K,

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.680
 they can very quickly get their calcium down to normal

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:13.680
 and the reason it's high is generally because they are eating too much phosphate

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.680
 and overdriving their parathyroid hormone.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.680
 Right.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.680
 Now could things like eating a lot of muscle meats and tryptophan

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:27.680
 or even taking 5-HPA, those things create the facilitation of parathyroid hormone

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.680
 in itself, causing more inflammation?

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:37.680
 Yes, many things do increase the parathyroid.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.680
 Serotonin does have a direct action,

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:51.680
 estrogen, cortisol, prolactin all have parallel

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.680
 and promoting effects on the parathyroid hormone.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:04.680
 Progesterone and thyroid are the main things that help to inhibit the parathyroid.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:11.680
 Part of that is that carbon dioxide produced in the cell,

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:17.680
 as it flows out of the cell that's constantly respiring,

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:23.680
 it forces calcium to leave the cell and that relaxes the cell

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.680
 because calcium should be outside the cell.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:33.680
 When it's in the cell, it tends to excite the cell and cause inflammation

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.680
 and lactic acid production.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:41.680
 So once you get the streaming flow of carbon dioxide out of the cell,

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:46.680
 you're getting calcium into the safe situation

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:52.680
 and it happens that parathyroid hormone activates glycolysis

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:58.680
 and the formation of lactic acid and that's a big part of how it dissolves the bone

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.680
 to provide more calcium for the bloodstream.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:08.680
 So everything that shifts the balance away from lactic acid production

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:14.680
 and towards carbon dioxide production helps to regulate,

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.680
 get the calcium back into the bloodstream out of cells,

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.680
 ready to go back into the bones.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:28.680
 And carbon dioxide, when they do tissue culture of, for example,

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:35.680
 a piece of a mouse skull which is very thin and can be kept in culture,

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:42.680
 the parathyroid hormone tends to dissolve it causing it to produce lactic acid.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:51.680
 But if you increase the carbon dioxide, the carbon dioxide directly starts forming crystals

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:58.680
 of calcium carbonate and restoring the mineral structure of the bone.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:04.680
 The first crystal laid down in bone is calcium carbonate,

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:14.680
 but as the bone matures some of the carbon dioxide is replaced by phosphate.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.680
 Wow, that was awesome.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.680
 That was awesome.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.680
 I'm all for salivating.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.680
 You talk a lot about CO2 and I know a lot of people have been e-mailing us and asking us

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:31.680
 and I know it's a little bit off the beaten path here and I'm not sure if you even have an answer,

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.680
 but a lot of people are asking because you're talking about how it actually helps to regulate the thyroid

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.680
 and you just talked about it a lot.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.680
 What does carbonated water have to do with that?

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.680
 Can you actually--can that be used?

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.680
 I mean, can we use CO2 levels to regulate the parathyroid?

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.680
 Of course, by regulating blood sugar and all that food, but can we use things like baking soda

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:55.680
 or carbonated water to actually facilitate that process?

00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:05.680
 Yeah, people have found that the exchange between bicarbonate and carbon dioxide is so quick

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:19.680
 that when you give a person a dose of sodium bicarbonate, the exchange of the bicarbonate to carbon dioxide

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:28.680
 is quick at the cell surface of a stressed cell and so you can actually acidify and restore to normal

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:38.680
 a stressed cell with baking soda because the sodium will quickly get lost out the urine,

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:46.680
 leaving the body as needed, acidified with the intracellular carbon dioxide,

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:53.680
 which puts the cell back into its anti-inflammatory resting state.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:05.680
 The excess sodium, it's the same as in the rat experiment where if you let the rat drink salty water,

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:11.680
 it isn't so desperately dependent on calcium in its diet.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:21.680
 The alkali minerals can substitute to a great extent for each other,

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:32.680
 so that a slight excess of magnesium or sodium or potassium will help to spare calcium in a stressed situation

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:41.680
 and calcium can likewise make up for a deficiency of one of the others.

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:49.680
 For example, if you're having cramps, it might essentially be a magnesium deficiency,

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:58.680
 but you can often stop the cramp with just baking soda or milk for the calcium

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:05.680
 or fruit for the high potassium content.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.680
 You mean actually ingesting the baking soda?

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:23.680
 Yes, or salty water sometimes does the same thing because it lets you rearrange the balance of your alkaline minerals

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:30.680
 and helps to make up for a crisis deficiency of one of them.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:39.680
 Awesome. Well, let's kind of rewind it a little bit and let's go back to dairy a little bit and we'll go back to calcium

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:44.680
 because we just had tons of questions and that, for me, what you just talked about was incredible, was awesome.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:49.680
 But I know a lot of people are listening and I know you talk about the two-fold of dairy.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:54.680
 You know, you talk about raw, but you also talk about how some people can't handle raw

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:58.680
 and you actually recommend for those people because of the pasteurization of the bacteria,

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.680
 the enzymes, that they actually can handle it.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:06.680
 And you recommend that, which of course goes against what a lot of people talk about.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:10.680
 Can you elaborate on the reason for that?

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:14.680
 For why pasteurized is better?

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:20.680
 Why some people can handle raw and some people can't and why you would recommend pasteurized?

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:32.680
 Every cow has its particular balance of bacteria, many of which will be chronically living in their udder.

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.680
 And it's a natural thing.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:41.680
 A healthy cow will have a very high bacteria count in its milk.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:52.680
 The individual cow will change its bacterial balance according to what it's eating and the season of the year,

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:58.680
 the particular weather that the cow is having.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.680
 It's extremely variable.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:12.680
 If a person in their own bacterial ecology has a bad reaction to some of the bacteria that they're getting from the cow,

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.680
 they can just try a different dairy.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:26.680
 It might still be raw, but even pasteurized milk still has enough of these individual herd bacteria

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:32.680
 that trying a different brand of pasteurized milk is sometimes all it takes.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:41.680
 And I know a few people who tend to get gas or diarrhea from most of the supermarket milks,

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:55.680
 but if they drink only the ultra-pasteurized milk that has been heated, I think, to 135 degrees Fahrenheit is a typical temperature,

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.680
 that they tolerate that nicely.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:07.680
 The ultra-pasteurized milk has somewhat lower vitamin content and it doesn't taste as good,

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.680
 but some people do tolerate that better.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:18.680
 Yeah, we've noticed that with a lot of clients, and it definitely goes against the norm, but it works.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.680
 So it's just an interesting caveat there.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.680
 Now what about yogurts?

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:28.680
 I know a lot of people talk about yogurts, how healthy they are, and I know your take on fermented foods,

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.680
 and I know your take on yogurts and lactic acid production and stress.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:37.680
 Can you elaborate on that for the listeners and the pluses and the minuses of that,

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.680
 and maybe when we should or shouldn't eat it?

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:49.680
 Well, the first worst concern is to make sure it doesn't contain carotene and gums.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:39:01.680
 I think we're showing up in more and more foods, especially yogurt and kefir and cheeses and such.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:10.680
 I think it even shows up in some so-called plain milk products.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:19.680
 I mean products that were intended to add the vitamin A and D to milk that contained a gum,

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.680
 such as alginate or carotene.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:30.680
 So the added vitamin is one of the potential sources of contamination,

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:39.680
 but if it says that it's just fermented milk yogurt, that's the safest kind of yogurt,

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:47.680
 and still it's better not to eat more than a few spoonfuls per day because any lactic acid,

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:55.680
 especially the kind formed by bacteria, is extra work for your liver.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:03.680
 The lactic acid that contacts your intestine cells, for example,

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:12.680
 activates the fibrosis-producing system, stimulating collagen production,

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:25.680
 and chronic exposure to lactic acid increases a general tendency to overproduction of all of the inflammatory system,

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:33.680
 but the cumulative thing is collagen accumulation and aging.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:45.680
 But the immediate effect of the lactic acid on the liver is that the liver is set up to turn lactic acid back into glucose,

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:55.680
 but to do that it takes energy and so it consumes glucose to get rid of the lactic acid,

00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:06.680
 and so it basically is a drain on your blood sugar reserves.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:12.680
 So I want to talk about that a little more, but can you elaborate a little bit more on the carrageenan and the gums?

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:16.680
 Because we find them in a lot of different things.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.680
 I think people need to realize what they are, what they do.

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.680
 I mean, I've seen them in liver pâtés.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:24.680
 Even roast beef.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:31.680
 They can inject a solution of carrageenan into roast beef, and I've seen advertisements.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:39.680
 You can increase the weight of your product and decrease the meat content by 30 percent

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:44.680
 by plumping it up with this jelly made from seaweed.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:42:02.680
 And this stuff is analogous to our connective tissue, the cartilage material and the breakdown material in the bloodstream, heparin.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:14.680
 It's a sulfated polysaccharide, and it's close enough to our own regulatory heparin and connective tissue system

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:21.680
 that it can be interpreted as a sign of damage to our own connective tissue,

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:28.680
 and so it can cause very acute immune reactions.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:38.680
 It's used experimentally to cause the research inflammation.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:44.680
 It's a very predictable and effective promoter of inflammation.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:57.680
 For example, they'll inject it into a rat paw and then test anti-inflammatory things for their protective effects.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:08.680
 The use of it in food is justified by experiments showing that the native carrageenan,

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:19.680
 as it is prepared right out of the seaweed, doesn't induce cancer in vitro tests.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:30.680
 But if you allow bacteria to break down the carrageenan into smaller fragments that more easily get into cells,

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:40.680
 that will cause cancer, and our intestine contains bacteria that are able to do that breakdown.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:52.680
 But there is such a big investment in using it in the food industry that the cancer-regulating agencies

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:58.680
 don't want to acknowledge the fact that when you eat native carrageenan,

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:13.680
 your bacteria are at risk for producing the carcinogenic degraded carrageenan, which is well known as a carcinogen.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:18.680
 And I'm not sure if you mentioned it as well, but it synthesizes with other toxins as well,

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:23.680
 unsaturated fats and estrogen, which just compound all issue in the GI system in the liver.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:29.680
 And I know you talked about how it's implicated, or you found that it's implicated in a lot of different GI diseases,

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:33.680
 like colitis and things like that.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.680
 So I think people should be aware that this stuff is in most dairy products.

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.680
 It's in a lot of beef products.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.680
 I've seen it in organic liver pâtés.

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:45.680
 It's in a lot of organic goat milk ice creams.

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:50.680
 And you'll know it's in there because you're going to get a ton of gas and bloating.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:57.680
 So start reading labels, and Ray has a lot of stuff on his website on carrageenan to educate yourself on the implications

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.680
 and what it does and where it comes from.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.680
 Can you talk about dairy in regards to saturated fats?

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:11.680
 Of course, we know you're huge on saturated fats, but maybe for the listeners, give us maybe some key points.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:19.680
 You know, dairy is important because of A, B, C, and D, but also the saturated fats and maybe why we need these.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:25.680
 There's a liver disease research group led by A.A. Nancy.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:39.680
 He has demonstrated a curative effect on hepatitis and cirrhosis from adding the saturated fats of a great variety of them,

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:48.680
 all the way from coconut oil through the butter fats up into the waxy long-chain saturated fats.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:57.680
 And similarly, they have shown that fish oils and the various seed oils that are polyunsaturated

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:02.680
 exacerbate the liver diseases and inflammations.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:18.680
 The breakdown products of the unsaturated fats produce a lot of the inflammatory diseases,

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:26.680
 and just by substituting saturated fats, you're going to have an anti-inflammatory effect generally

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:39.680
 and somewhat of an antioxidant effect by interrupting the free radical oxidation product of the polyunsaturated.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:46.680
 Everyone's body, with aging, accumulates more and more of the polyunsaturated fats,

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:56.680
 and probably the saturated fats become more important protectively and therapeutically

00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:04.680
 after a person is metabolically slowing down in their 20s and 30s.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:16.680
 A kid who's growing like a small two- or three-year-old kid might have twice the metabolic rate that an adult does,

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:21.680
 and they can burn up much more of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:29.680
 As the metabolism slows down, even a small amount of the polyunsaturated in the diet will tend to accumulate

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:36.680
 and increase the tissue inflammation and oxidation processes.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:46.680
 So there's constantly some turnover, so if you can keep your food high on the saturation side,

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:56.680
 you can progressively--usually you can make some headway against those stored polyunsaturateds

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:02.680
 and it might take years to restore a good balance,

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:10.680
 but it's worth the effort to minimize the polyunsaturates.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.680
 Right.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:16.680
 So we've seen, guys, it's a complete macronutrient, it's got saturated fats.

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.680
 It's low in iron, correct?

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:34.680
 Yeah. The reason it's low in iron is that during pregnancy, the estrogen of the mother is--one of its functions--

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:42.680
 well, two functions are to cause the intestine to absorb more calcium and more iron.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:52.680
 A woman will typically absorb nine or ten times as much iron out of her given food as a man does.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:49:00.680
 So an iron supplement is especially risky when your estrogen is high.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:07.680
 And one of the functions of estrogen is to lower oxygen tension,

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:13.680
 and the fetus is in a situation of low oxygen tension,

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:24.680
 and so it accumulates iron partly from the estrogen exposure but partly from the oxygen deficit.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:35.680
 So the fetus reaches its maturity and is born overcharged with iron.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:43.680
 It typically has enough iron in its tissues that it doesn't need to eat any iron for about six months to a year.

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:53.680
 And so milk is designed to let the baby grow into its potentially toxic overcharge with iron,

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:59.680
 and so milk is relatively very free of iron.

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:12.680
 And that's one of the protective effects that many of our foods have a potential overdose of iron, especially the meat.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:20.680
 And men, by the time they're 50, are generally well overloaded with iron,

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:31.680
 and that contributes to free radical oxidation and is probably a big factor in heart disease and liver disease and so on.

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:37.680
 And women, to some extent, are protected as long as they're menstruating,

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.680
 throwing off some of the iron every month.

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:46.680
 But when they stop menstruating, then their tissues start overloading with iron.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:51.680
 Milk and cheese are foods that are deficient in iron,

00:50:51.680 --> 00:51:00.680
 and so adding them generously to the diet will help you prevent that chronic tendency to overcharge on iron.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.680
 Right.

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:07.680
 And Ray has a lot on the site, guys, about iron, and maybe we can do a show on that sometime, but that's a huge topic.

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.680
 So we learn so many benefits of milk.

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:11.680
 It's just amazing.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.680
 What about cheeses?

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.680
 I know you talk about cheeses,

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.680
 and we have to really watch for, of course, what type of cheese that we eat,

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.680
 but also what's in the cheese and the cultures in the cheese.

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:22.680
 Can you elaborate a little bit on that for the listeners?

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:23.680
 Yeah.

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:36.680
 Recently I saw an advertisement for one of the big additive companies that says that 60-some percent of the cheeses now made in the world use their cultures,

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:42.680
 and their cultures are basically from bacteria and fungus,

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:56.680
 and they're cheap substitutes for the naturally grown bacterial and fungal cultures that cheeses have.

00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:05.680
 Their traditional location and type of cow and so on has determined the type of bacteria and fungus,

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:15.680
 and traditionally they're made with bovine digestive enzymes as a way to clot the cheese,

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:23.680
 and they're now using fungal and bacterial substitutes for these beef enzymes,

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:41.680
 and that's almost all cheeses commercially now are risky because of those microorganisms that are used in substituting for the traditional methods,

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:48.680
 and that's besides any additive for modifying the texture.

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:53.680
 I think this is where dairy, and like I mentioned at the beginning, and cheeses get such a bad rap,

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.680
 and it's really about looking at where it comes from, what's in it,

00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:03.680
 and a lot of the times it's really not the dairy, it's the cultures, it's the carrageen, it's what the animals fed,

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:10.680
 it's all these different things, and we're blaming dairy when dairy has so many great qualities, which is kind of sad.

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.680
 Now what about whey protein powders?

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:19.680
 I know you talk about that, and there's a lot of people out there that just, you know, we can talk about protein and diet on a whole other show,

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:27.680
 but there's so many people out there using protein powders, and I know you talk -- I'm sorry?

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:41.680
 About 40 or 50 years ago, the dairies that were producing cheese would give their whey in a liquid state fresh out of the cheese factory

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:51.680
 to hog farmers, and in that fresh state it was mixed with other foods for hog slop, and it produced very healthy pigs,

00:53:51.680 --> 00:54:03.680
 and as a stimulant to growth when mixed with a lot of fruits and vegetables and other waste foods,

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:10.680
 it was very good pig food compared to the corn and soybeans that pigs are now getting fed.

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:17.680
 But when it's sold, because pigs aren't eating it anymore, they have to dispose of it some way,

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:30.680
 and the process of dehydrating it, turning it into a powder, since milk products are very high in the fragile amino acids,

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:42.680
 including tryptophan and cysteine, the process of dehydrating it increases the oxidation of the protein

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:50.680
 and not only lowers the protein value but increases its toxicity and allergenicity.

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:59.680
 So I don't recommend any dehydrated food except in emergency where they're convenient for transportation and storage,

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:09.680
 but as a regular thing, dehydrated anything is a potential risk.

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:15.680
 Can you elaborate a little bit more? I remember from your article you talked about albumin in regards to whey protein.

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:26.680
 Yeah, the casein that you get in the cheese and you throw away largely the albumin fraction,

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:39.680
 the casein protein turns out to be anti-inflammatory and anti-stress, helps hold down the cortisol production,

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:45.680
 and you get the opposite effect from the whey fraction.

00:55:45.680 --> 00:56:02.680
 So it has many direct nutritional problems. Probably the worst one is that most of the calcium stays with the cheese,

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:19.680
 and so you have a protein which is easily degraded and lacks the anti-stress factors and is deficient in calcium.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:24.680
 Interesting. Go for it.

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:35.680
 One of the reasons a lot of people give if they have overcome the idea that milk forms mucus

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:44.680
 or is a risk for various diseases and so on, one of their arguments is that it makes them fat,

00:56:44.680 --> 00:57:00.680
 and all the research on animals and as far as it goes, the human research shows that milk is probably the best reducing food there is.

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:08.680
 The mechanisms for that are now known, not only the anti-stress effect of the casein

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:18.680
 and the good balance of saturated fats and so on, but the calcium alone is a very important metabolic regulator.

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:26.680
 It happens to inhibit the fat-forming enzymes, fatty acid synthase,

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:34.680
 and incidentally that's a characteristic enzyme that goes wild in cancer.

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:43.680
 Calcium and milk inhibit that fatty acid synthase, reducing the formation of fats,

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:52.680
 and at the same time it activates the uncoupling proteins in the mitochondria,

00:57:52.680 --> 00:58:02.680
 which are associated with increased longevity because by increasing the metabolic rate,

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:12.680
 the uncoupling proteins burn calories faster, but they protect against pre-radical oxidation.

00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:20.680
 They pull the fuel through the oxidation process so fast, in effect,

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:31.680
 that none of it goes astray in random oxidation, where if you inhibit your energy-producing enzymes,

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:37.680
 you tend to get random stray oxidations that damage the mitochondria.

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:46.680
 So the uncoupling proteins burn calories faster at the same time that you're reducing fat synthesis,

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:57.680
 and milk is, as far as I know, the only food that does both of those things simultaneously.

00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:03.680
 Now what about the pasteurized milk? A lot of people say the calcium, the vitamins, they're all synthetic.

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:07.680
 Is there any concern over that, or are they so low?

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:10.680
 And of course, we're not just saying just drink dairy.

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:13.680
 We're talking about if you're using broth and gelatin and tropical fruits,

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.680
 you're getting all these other vitamins.

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.680
 Is it okay, or is it dangerous that it's kind of synthetic?

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:23.680
 Oh, well, for one thing, it's a very small amount of the vitamins,

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:31.680
 and even though I'm allergic to just a tiny amount of synthetic vitamin A,

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:36.680
 it will give me a headache for a couple of days, just a trace of it.

00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:41.680
 I can drink a gallon of milk containing their added vitamin A,

00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:49.680
 and apparently other things in the milk protect me from that intense allergic reaction to synthetic A.

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:55.680
 But it is a problem that they, to anything but whole milk,

00:59:55.680 --> 01:00:03.680
 they're required to add vitamin A and D in the United States.

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.680
 So you drink a gallon of milk a day?

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:13.680
 Probably that's been my average for 35 years or so.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:20.680
 I think I average probably now only two, two and a half, or three quarts

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:25.680
 when I can get lots of orange juice or other --

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.680
 So I'm guessing that the good outweighs the bad when it comes to milk

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:33.680
 because it still has those high levels of tryptophan and whatnot.

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.680
 Is that --

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:39.680
 Yeah, the calcium, by stimulating our metabolism,

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:47.680
 keeps us more like the teenager metabolically who can handle and balance those things.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.680
 But that's where gelatin and fruit come in,

01:00:52.680 --> 01:01:01.680
 helping to shift the balance somewhat away from that high tryptophan and cysteine content.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.680
 Right.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.680
 Now, I don't want people to walk away from this going, "Oh, my God,

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.680
 I'm going to start pounding milk in a gallon of milk, and, jeez, because,

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.680
 of course, guys, it's all individualized.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.680
 There's so many other factors that you need to be doing nutritionally.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.680
 You need to start slow.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.680
 You've got to find the right type."

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.680
 There's a lot of factors, but what do you recommend calorically?

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.680
 I mean, do you recommend that as like a power protein

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:27.680
 and really getting a lot of your calories from dairy?

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:37.680
 Oh, ideally, I would get half my calories anyway from fruit.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.680
 Half your calories from fruit.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:48.680
 Yeah, and the proportion of protein, carbohydrate, and fat,

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:53.680
 it probably should be something like a third of each,

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.680
 but I'm not sure what the ideal is.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:01.680
 It depends so much on the quality of each of them.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.680
 Right.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.680
 So, avoiding starch and avoiding polyunsaturated fats

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:14.680
 and avoiding the very high cryptophane content proteins,

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:25.680
 then you could go very high on any one of the major nutrients without problem.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.680
 Wow, great stuff on dairy.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.680
 Let's kind of shift the gears a little.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.680
 We're talking about calcium, and, of course,

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.680
 we can go back to milk and filter it in if needed.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.680
 We were talking about parathyroid hormone and its inflammatory.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.680
 Can, because there's so much out there on all these different diets,

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.680
 and this is the reason why I love your philosophy, because it's not a diet.

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.680
 It's really aligning with how the body works.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:54.680
 And there's so many diets out there, of course, it's all about weight loss,

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:57.680
 and we all need to do our own thing,

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:01.680
 but it's all about high protein, high protein, high protein.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.680
 Can a high-protein diet, and this is, you know, for the listeners,

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.680
 or a diet that's low in carb or low in fat,

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:14.680
 can that actually create the over-stimulation of parathyroid hormone?

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:23.680
 Yeah, because most protein comes with lots of phosphate.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:29.680
 Grains, beans are very bad protein but very high in phosphate.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.680
 Meats are good protein but very high in phosphate.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:41.680
 And the ratio between phosphate and calcium is the main thing

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:45.680
 that activates the parathyroid hormone.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:56.680
 And so minimizing phosphate or increasing calcium is extremely important.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.680
 So when we're talking osteoporosis, because we see this a lot with people on the Web

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:06.680
 and with clients, it's this high-protein thing that's going on,

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:09.680
 and that can be actually even more detrimental.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.680
 Can you correlate that with--you correlated the demineralization of the bone

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.680
 by the parathyroid hormone.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.680
 Does estrogen and cortisol also play a part in that process?

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:27.680
 Yeah, the parathyroid hormone increases with a woman's menstrual cycle.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:32.680
 When estrogen is dominant, parathyroid hormone is highest,

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:38.680
 and prolactin, cortisol, increase the parathyroid hormone.

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:41.680
 Serotonin increases it.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:52.680
 It's interesting that the things that estrogen increases--prolactin, serotonin,

01:04:52.680 --> 01:05:01.680
 parathyroid hormone, cortisol--all of these are known to dissolve the bones.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:08.680
 So it's very interesting that they promote estrogen as a bone strengthener.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:16.680
 In the 50 or 60 years that women have been taught to use estrogen,

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:21.680
 so that almost American women have used estrogen,

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:28.680
 the rate of breaking hips has increased.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:34.680
 So since all of the mechanisms through which estrogen affects

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:42.680
 the parathyroid hormone, serotonin, cortisol, and prolactin,

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.680
 those are all well established,

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:54.680
 and those bone-dissolving hormones are constantly present.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:06:01.680
 For example, with aging, a person's parathyroid hormone increases

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:08.680
 as the bone mineral density decreases.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:13.680
 And there's a tendency for the cortisol to become dominant with aging,

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:18.680
 and prolactin, both in men and women,

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:25.680
 has an increasing tendency to become dominant in age.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.680
 Right.

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.680
 Now, of course, that has to do with the foods we eat,

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.680
 and how we eat them, and regulating our blood sugar

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:38.680
 to down-regulate glucocorticoids, which is cortisol.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:42.680
 But progesterone would play a factor in that as well,

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:47.680
 and I could be wrong with this, but progesterone in itself stimulates--

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.680
 what is it?--the osteoblasts to help rebuild bone.

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.680
 Estrogen stimulates the osteoclasts.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.680
 So if you're progesterone deficient or estrogen dominant,

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.680
 you're going to see that demineralization of bone.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.680
 So the progesterone itself, supplementation or through food,

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:07.680
 could actually benefit and help that process.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.680
 Yes, and testosterone.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:11.680
 Okay.

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:17.680
 The same factors that interrupt progesterone metabolism

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.680
 also interrupt testosterone.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:28.680
 High tryptophan or serotonin exposure will lower your testosterone.

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:35.680
 High polyunsaturated fats will lower your testosterone,

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:40.680
 and testosterone protects against the parathyroid hormone

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:44.680
 and strengthens the bones.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.680
 Now, in people that have, let's say, calcium deposits

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:51.680
 or things like that, like bone spurs and things like that,

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.680
 I mean, besides that, are there any other ways besides a lab

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.680
 to know if you're high or low in calcium?

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.680
 And if you do have a bone spur,

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:02.680
 can that tell you anything about your calcium levels?

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:06.680
 I think it usually happens in people who are eating too much phosphate,

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.680
 not enough calcium.

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:14.680
 And sometimes a general vitamin deficiency can be involved

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:22.680
 because, for example, niacinamide and vitamin A work to regulate

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:28.680
 the phosphate calcium balance as well as vitamin D and vitamin A.

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:37.680
 But vitamin K is a very safe thing that currently is stylation.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:43.680
 It seems to be involved in our basic energy production

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:49.680
 the way thyroid and niacinamide are.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.680
 That's interesting.

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.680
 I mean, I guess I always forget the whole testosterone thing,

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.680
 but that's an interesting fact.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:00.680
 Now, in regards to--go for it.

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:05.680
 No, I was just going to say that testosterone is important for women too.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:11.680
 The natural androgens, DHEA and testosterone,

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:17.680
 are protective against hardening of the arteries in both men and women.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.680
 Now, would you recommend, of course, on the food side of it,

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:26.680
 but feeding the pathway from the top down, especially in women not using the testosterone?

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.680
 Of course, we're not saying or advocating using it,

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:33.680
 but feeding the pathway from the top down with maybe a pregnenolone or something versus--

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.680
 Yeah, and cholesterol.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:41.680
 Cholesterol has a protective effect against excess parathyroid hormone

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:49.680
 because it's near the top, feeding your liver just what it needs so it can make cholesterol.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:53.680
 Then the cholesterol with thyroid and vitamin A

01:09:53.680 --> 01:10:00.680
 will let your glands make the pregnenolone, progesterone, testosterone, DHEA.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.680
 All right.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:08.680
 What does parathyroid hormone and inflammation have to do with anemia?

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.680
 Because a lot of people out there say, "Oh, I have anemia,"

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.680
 and a lot of times they're not specifying which kind,

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:21.680
 but is there a correlation between anemia or any of those in parathyroid hormone?

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:25.680
 I'm not sure if there's a direct connection,

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:31.680
 but the thyroid and parathyroid tend to go in opposite directions

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:43.680
 and the thyroid stimulating hormone definitely is involved in anemia, inflammation,

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:49.680
 liver malfunction, and so on, so that when a person is hypothyroid,

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:57.680
 they tend to have high parathyroid hormone and high thyroid stimulating hormone.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.680
 Just looking at the individual who is hypothyroid,

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:10.680
 you can see that their parathyroid hormone must be having a role in such things,

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:17.680
 but experimentally the thyroid stimulating hormone has a definite connection

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:22.680
 to malfunction of the bone marrow and blood vessels

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:28.680
 and serotonin metabolism, liver metabolism.

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:33.680
 Now, besides dairy and besides taking calcium pills,

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.680
 we know that you've talked about vitamin K, D, vitamin A, niacinamide,

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.680
 things like that, of course nutrition to regulate inflammation.

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:50.680
 What are some other nutritional sources of calcium besides dairy?

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:55.680
 For a person who wants a safe supplement, eggshells,

01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:02.680
 if you boil your eggs to get any additives and cleaners off them,

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:10.680
 eggshells are the purest form of calcium carbonate to use as a supplement,

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:19.680
 and calcium carbonate is probably the ideal form to use as a supplement.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:27.680
 Crustacean shells and mollusk shells and eggshells

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:33.680
 are natural forms of calcium carbonate,

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:40.680
 but eggshells usually when they've been tested are even cleaner than oyster shells

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:44.680
 as a calcium carbonate source.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:47.680
 Now, how would you recommend adjusting them,

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:52.680
 adding them down to a powder and taking in how much?

01:12:52.680 --> 01:13:00.680
 Yeah, a fourth to a half teaspoon if a person is not getting their milk calcium.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.680
 Okay. Interesting.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:07.680
 Many years ago I had a relative who was a baseball player.

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:12.680
 In his 30s he kept breaking his arm, throwing balls,

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:19.680
 and his x-rays showed that he had the skeleton of a very old man,

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:22.680
 this terrible osteoporosis,

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:28.680
 and his doctor prescribed a tablespoon of powdered eggshells every day.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:36.680
 And it was just two or three months, his x-rays showed normal bones,

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:41.680
 and he went back and played ball for another 10 years or so,

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.680
 and he had one other bone.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.680
 Yeah, it's interesting.

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.680
 I mean, there's so many women that are just told,

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.680
 and we see this in assessments, they come in, they're whatever, 40, 50,

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:55.680
 and they're just pumping calcium into their body.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.680
 Well, the counterion is really important.

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:05.680
 For some reason the drug industry wants to sell various things,

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:13.680
 calcium gluconate, calcium citrate, calcium lactate,

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:21.680
 even some fairly toxic things, calcium aspartate,

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:27.680
 things that have a toxic effect of their own.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:30.680
 So the very thing they're taking that I think is actually helping them

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:34.680
 could be making matters worse, or if they are making matters worse.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:41.680
 Yeah, the counterion is a significant problem for a lot of the supplements.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.680
 Wow, that's amazing.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.680
 This is just as simple as, of course, regulating nutrition,

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:53.680
 but utilizing things to downregulate parathyroid hormone, cortisol,

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.680
 estrogen, prolactin, nutritionally, as well as adding in some boiled eggshells,

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:03.680
 which is quite cheap compared to buying all this chorocalcium on these infomercials

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.680
 and people just going nuts over it.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:09.680
 You talk a lot about aspirin as well.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:15.680
 Is there any correlation between maybe the proper use of aspirin in calcium regulation?

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.680
 Yeah.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.680
 Aspirin has some direct effects on the bone,

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:31.680
 blocking the prostaglandins that cause the inflammation related to parathyroid hormones, glycolysis,

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:39.680
 the prostaglandins are very important factors in osteoporosis, and aspirin blocks that.

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:50.680
 But aspirin also inhibits the pituitary stress hormones and so tends to lower cortisol,

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:56.680
 and by lowering estrogen, it reduces the prolactin,

01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:10.680
 all working in the direction to strengthen your bones and keep calcium out of your blood vessels in your bones where it should be.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:13.680
 So, of course, you've written a lot about it on your site,

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.680
 so you're definitely an advocate of it for those reasons.

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:20.680
 Of course, reducing inflammatory prostaglandins,

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:25.680
 but also helping kind of the cells breathe, in a sense, to help reduce inflammation.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:29.680
 And stimulating carbon dioxide production.

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:30.680
 Right, right.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:37.680
 Can you talk a little bit about fibrosis in calcium, what calcium has to do with that in our body, in our arteries?

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:50.680
 Hans Selye was concentrating for several years on the process of -- he called it either calciphylaxis or calcirgy,

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:58.680
 where calcium goes wild and causes spasms in blood vessels, even shuts off circulation,

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:04.680
 causes gangrene of the extremities or of the skin,

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:12.680
 and scleroderma, in which the skin progressively calcifies rather than acutely.

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:20.680
 And he showed that serotonin was a major factor.

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:44.680
 The stress combined with local irritation causes the first fibrosis, and then the fibrotic tissue absorbs calcium and creates inflammation and calcification.

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:57.680
 The inflammation with lactic acid production and the influence of lactic acid displacing carbon dioxide

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:07.680
 is what most immediately leads to the overproduction of collagen,

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:21.680
 and eventually those same factors displacing carbon dioxide will cause the tissue to calcify.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:22.680
 Interesting.

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:26.680
 So that's a ton of information on dairy and calcium.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:32.680
 I think I've riddled through about 35-plus questions that I had.

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:37.680
 I'd love to take some callers if anyone wants to call in, or we'd love to take some callers.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:42.680
 And if you've got some questions for Ray in regards to dairy, calcium, hormones, anything in itself,

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.680
 feel free to call in.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:51.680
 The thyroid number is 347-426-3546.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:52.680
 We've got a caller right here.

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.680
 Do you mind taking a call, Ray?

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:54.680
 I should ask you first.

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.680
 Okay, sure.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:58.680
 Okay.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.680
 I'm on the air, area code 111, whatever that area code is.

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.680
 Oh, that's -- is it me?

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:07.680
 Yeah, it is you.

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:08.680
 Oh, okay.

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:11.680
 My area code is 520.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.680
 Anyways, thanks for taking my call.

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:18.680
 I will keep it on topic.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:25.680
 I think that Ray just talked about this, but maybe there's a little more that could be said.

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:34.680
 I know that there's the curious effect of calcification of tissues when, in fact, the calcium is low.

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:38.680
 Did I miss it, or did you already talk about that?

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:46.680
 Yeah, that's where you get increased parathyroid hormone that displaces.

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:52.680
 It takes calcium out of the bones and puts it into soft tissues.

01:19:52.680 --> 01:20:02.680
 That can be offset by eating more calcium and taking vitamin K, for example.

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:03.680
 Interesting.

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.680
 Okay.

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:10.680
 I don't know if you want to go off subject.

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:14.680
 I guess that's the only related one that I had.

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:15.680
 Well, go for it.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:16.680
 Go for it.

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:19.680
 We'll see how far off topic you can go.

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:23.680
 Okay, I won't go too far.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.680
 This has been a marathon, too.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:29.680
 I'm surprised.

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:40.680
 Dr. Peat, I haven't seen anything about fluoride on your site, and I suppose that's sort of related, as I think it also has to do with calcification of tissues.

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:46.680
 I think you'd probably agree that it's a toxin that shouldn't be in our systems.

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.680
 But where is fluoride on your radar?

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:53.680
 How much of a danger would you say it is in our environment?

01:20:53.680 --> 01:21:07.680
 Oh, I avoid fluoridated water carefully because I, without thinking about it, during a stay in San Francisco,

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:15.680
 wasn't aware that the water was fluoridated, and I started getting extreme hypothyroid symptoms.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:29.680
 And I realized that the water that I drank had enough fluoride in it to totally destroy the thyroid supplement that I was taking.

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:42.680
 So the first place that fluoride can act is by destroying nutrients and hormones that you might be taking.

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:52.680
 But to the extent that fluoride circulates in your bloodstream, where T3, the active thyroid hormone, is also circulating,

01:21:52.680 --> 01:22:00.680
 it just takes one fluoride atom to ruin the T3 molecule.

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:06.680
 So my own experience with it is as a thyroid toxin.

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:24.680
 But John Yamajanis and Dean Burke did some good studies pretty conclusively showing that a population that's fluoridated has a higher cancer rate.

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.680
 All right. Thank you.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.680
 Thank you for calling.

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.680
 Yeah. Thanks for having me.

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.680
 Yeah, no problem. I appreciate you calling in.

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:35.680
 Sure.

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:39.680
 Bye-bye.

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.680
 Ray, do you mind taking another caller?

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:43.680
 No, it's fine.

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:44.680
 Okay.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:48.680
 Arico360, you're on the air.

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:52.680
 Yes. Hi. My name is Sean. I'm not sure if you've discussed this already on the show.

01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:54.680
 I was tuning in about 20 minutes ago.

01:22:54.680 --> 01:23:00.680
 But my question is consumption of dairy, I've noticed an increase of acne, and I'm 24 years old.

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:04.680
 It's been happening since I was about 14 or 15.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:09.680
 I'll be quick to rule out it was a hormone thing, but I've done a lot of studies on myself.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:15.680
 Every time I ingest dairy or cheese or anything with it, I have an increased breakout.

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:21.680
 So what would your thoughts be about that on acne and all that?

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:41.680
 The vitamin A and thyroid and the hormones DHEA, androgens, testosterone, and progesterone balance the inflammatory

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:47.680
 and antiimmune things that aren't normally present.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:57.680
 I suspect that the connection between dairy and acne is that it's increasing your metabolic rate

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:03.680
 and increasing your requirement for some nutrients.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:08.680
 Usually vitamin A is the limiting nutrient.

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:21.680
 And people who do anything that increases their metabolic rate, and calcium is a very powerful stimulant to metabolism,

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:31.680
 the increased metabolic rate makes you consume vitamin A and probably several other nutrients involved in the skin.

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:40.680
 But vitamin A is most commonly the limiting factor in acne.

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:45.680
 So vitamin A. I also wanted to ask you about the calcium in the eggshell.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.680
 Do you just boil those for about 10 minutes or so is what you were saying?

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:58.680
 Yeah, like if you're going to eat boiled eggs, that already takes care of the toxins that might be on the shell.

01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:02.680
 So you just kind of, right. Well, definitely looking at vitamin A.

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:06.680
 That was an interesting answer. I've never thought about that. So thanks a lot.

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.680
 Thank you for calling in.

01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:10.680
 Thanks.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:13.680
 We got another caller in, but I got one quick question for you.

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:18.680
 You talked about vitamin A, but I know you talk about how it can actually be toxic to us.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:24.680
 So when you recommend taking vitamin A, do you recommend people actually rubbing it on the skin or ingesting it?

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:32.680
 Well, my own experience with commercial vitamin A is that I used it for many years,

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:39.680
 but then the product is constantly being changed as they find cheaper ways to do it.

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:47.680
 And suddenly something about some of the products caused extreme sensitivity.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:54.680
 I can use some forms of vitamin A wildly and generously with no effect,

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:59.680
 but some of them have additives that make them very allergenic.

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:07.680
 And the basic toxic effect of giant doses of vitamin A, like several hundred thousand units a day,

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:13.680
 those invariably will reach a point where they suppress your thyroid.

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:23.680
 The whole range of carotenes aren't really vitamin A,

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:32.680
 but they even more than vitamin A have an antithyroid and potentially antisteroid action

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:46.680
 by accumulating and displacing the vitamin A that's necessary for metabolism in the skin and making steroids.

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:52.680
 So you don't want to overload, especially on the carotenes,

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:59.680
 but eventually vitamin A itself can be an antithyroid, antisteroid problem.

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:10.680
 I got interested in vitamin A because I found that every time I worked outside in the summer, I got acne.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:16.680
 And people had told me that sunlight was good for the skin,

01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:23.680
 but I invariably got acne in proportion to my exposure to sunlight,

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:28.680
 and I figured it was some toxic effect of ultraviolet light.

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:36.680
 But then one night I went to sleep reading with a very bright light shining in my face

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:43.680
 and slept eight hours with that light just a foot and a half from my eyes

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:47.680
 and woke up starting to get pimples.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:57.680
 And I suddenly realized that it was activating not only my retinal vitamin A system,

01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:06.680
 but via my eyes it was activating my hormonal system and consuming vitamin A.

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:12.680
 And I found that in proportion to my sun exposure or light exposure,

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:21.680
 if I increased the vitamin A, I could prevent acne and it turns out to be protective in other ways.

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:30.680
 The nutrition researcher, dentist, Emanuel Churaskin, did surveys where he found that

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:39.680
 health complaints and symptoms decreased in a nice linear relation to increasing vitamin A

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:43.680
 all the way up to 100,000 units a day.

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:51.680
 But anyone who is on the borderline for thyroid function, sometimes even 20,000 units

01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:55.680
 will make their symptoms worse by suppressing their thyroid.

01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:01.680
 So you just have to be very cautious and probably starting with 5,000 units

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:10.680
 and watching for allergic symptoms and checking your temperature to see if it's inhibiting your thyroid.

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:18.680
 Very often people have to get up to 20,000 or 30,000 units a day before their acne improves.

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:23.680
 You're talking about the plant source being more toxic than the animal source?

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:30.680
 Yes, because it depends on vitamin B12 to be converted

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:36.680
 and the thyroid function is inhibited if it isn't converted.

01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:43.680
 But at the same time, if you're eating a lot of good quality eggs and dairy

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:50.680
 and your recommendation using fresh quality liver, could you get enough vitamin A that way?

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:58.680
 Oh, sure. One serving of liver a week and an egg or two every day and milk,

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:04.680
 for most people that's plenty of vitamin A.

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.680
 Am I taking another caller?

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:07.680
 Sure.

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:09.680
 Okay.

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:15.680
 Caller from the 617 Boston, you are on the air.

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:18.680
 Thank you. Dr. Peat, I have a question for you.

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:28.680
 I've been reading about milk pros and cons and a lot of the anti-milk articles argue that actually milk

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:34.680
 drains your calcium out of your bones because it has higher phosphorous to calcium ratio

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:37.680
 than we have in the human body.

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:39.680
 What do you think about that argument?

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:46.680
 I never really knew if it was a problem or then I heard you speak about reducing the higher phosphate foods,

01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:50.680
 but would it not matter in the milk?

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:58.680
 No, the ratio in milk is very high towards calcium so that you can, even eating some meat

01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:04.680
 or other foods that are high in phosphate, if you drink a good amount of milk,

01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:12.680
 the high calcium will put those other excess phosphates into proportion.

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:19.680
 It should be one and a half calcium per phosphate anyway.

01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:24.680
 Right, right, but for some reason they talked about the phosphate being higher in the calcium,

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:27.680
 and so they were wrong in that statement.

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:38.680
 Yeah, on PubMed you can find that discussed and basically milk is next to eggshells.

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:41.680
 It's our best source of calcium.

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:44.680
 Okay. Okay, thank you very much.

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:52.680
 There are lots of movements trying to think up something wrong with milk.

01:31:52.680 --> 01:32:02.680
 One of the recent ones is to say that all animal products, beef, pork, milk and cheese and eggs,

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:15.680
 so on, all of these contain a sialic acid form that is allergenic and so will cause cancer.

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:27.680
 That's probably just sort of a sales pitch for a genetic engineering company.

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:40.680
 Anyone with some interesting bit of research will tend to do a lot of publicity against milk.

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:46.680
 They claim that it causes diabetes and heart disease and so on,

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:58.680
 but blood pressure is one of the best researched topics that milk protects against, calcium in particular.

01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:02.680
 I'll check out the PubMed.

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:10.680
 I mean I came across like a review article and this person, and I don't have the reference anymore.

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:14.680
 It was a while ago, and this person was talking against milk,

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:21.680
 and he said, "I have studied 1,200 research articles and the evidence points against the milk."

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:28.680
 I haven't had time to research all the 1,200 articles, and I just took it for granted,

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:33.680
 which I should not have done, but thanks for clarifying this.

01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.680
 Okay.

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:40.680
 Thanks for calling in. We appreciate it.

01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:42.680
 Ray, I've got a question for you.

01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:48.680
 One of the callers just actually emailed me, and I honestly don't remember if you've already touched upon this,

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:51.680
 so I apologize if you have.

01:33:51.680 --> 01:34:01.680
 But she was wondering with the increased dairy intake, what she's seeing is an increase in weight.

01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:03.680
 In weight?

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.680
 Yes, like weight gain.

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:10.680
 Say the word again.

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:11.680
 I'm sorry.

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:14.680
 Increase in what?

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:15.680
 Body weight.

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:16.680
 Body weight.

01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:24.680
 Oh, yeah, that's very definitely the mechanisms that I mentioned,

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:35.680
 inhibiting the fat-producing enzyme system and stimulating the calorie-burning uncoupling protein.

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:46.680
 Those are clearly established papers by Michael Zemel and his group, Sun and Xi and others.

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:53.680
 They've done some very good studies on curing obesity with milk products,

01:34:53.680 --> 01:35:02.680
 but there are a lot of other groups that have noticed that milk drinkers are very rarely obese,

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:07.680
 chronic users of a quart of milk or more a day.

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:11.680
 So you're saying that weight gain is actually a positive sign?

01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:22.680
 Well, no, gain in obesity is not known to be produced by milk.

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:27.680
 If you ate nothing but Haagen-Dazs ice cream, you could get fat.

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:38.680
 But milk with a high ratio of protein and calcium to the fat is the best way to lose weight,

01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:43.680
 except that it does help to build muscle.

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:51.680
 Its anti-inflammatory anabolic effect helps to build muscle, which is a good way to gain weight.

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:52.680
 Of course.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.680
 Great.

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:54.680
 Thank you.

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:59.680
 We've got time for a couple more calls. If you want to call in, 347-426-3546.

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:04.680
 It's been a great show. It's actually been one of my favorite shows.

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:07.680
 We'll take one more caller, if you don't mind, Ray.

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.680
 Okay.

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:14.680
 Dairy Code 111, Mr. E-Man, you're on the air.

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:17.680
 That's me again. Thank you.

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:24.680
 I realize that another question I had in mind was related to dairy as well because it's about trans fats.

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.680
 And there's word out there that dairy is actually a source of natural trans fats.

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:33.680
 I don't know if there's a difference between natural and synthetic.

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:39.680
 And I was wondering if Ray Peat had an opinion on that and maybe on trans fats in general.

01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:45.680
 Where are they in terms of danger, maybe, compared to the polyunsaturates?

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:53.680
 Have you heard about conjugated linoleic acid and its therapeutic benefits?

01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:56.680
 In displacing linoleic?

01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:06.680
 Well, conjugated linoleic acid, it's being sold therapeutically because it has so many protective effects,

01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:13.680
 stimulating the metabolism and being anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity and so on.

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:22.680
 But that's a natural component of milk and dairy fat in general.

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:32.680
 And the trans fats are just in process on the way to forming the conjugated linoleic acid.

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:42.680
 And I think their benefit is that they block the polyunsaturated fats, linoleic acid in particular.

01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:51.680
 Linoleic acid is the anti-thyroid, pro-cancer, pro-inflammatory, so-called essential fatty acid.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:38:02.680
 And there have been studies for about 20 years showing that trans fats can have a protective effect in themselves

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:09.680
 as an inhibitor of the linoleic acid toxic effect.

01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:16.680
 But more importantly, the dairy trans fats are precursors to conjugated linoleic acid,

01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:23.680
 which is specifically active biologically in a good way.

01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:36.680
 And the mechanism by which these are formed is bacteria in the rumen hydrogenate

01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:40.680
 in a protective detoxifying reaction.

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:47.680
 They detoxify the polyunsaturated fats in the vegetable material that the cow is eating.

01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:57.680
 And if the cow is eating a natural diet rich in vitamin E, such as leaves rather than grain,

01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:09.680
 the vitamin E is a cofactor in the hydrogenating bacteria turning the unsaturated fats to saturated.

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:18.680
 And in the 2% of the fats that are missed, there's a small amount of intermediate,

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:28.680
 not fully hydrogenated material, which turns out to be the trans fats and the conjugated linoleic acid.

01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:38.680
 And those in themselves in small amounts, I think there's good evidence showing that they in themselves have a protective effect.

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:44.680
 That's amazing. I would have never thought I would hear anybody say anything good about trans fats.

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:48.680
 But you did add that they were in very small amounts.

01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:55.680
 So is that what makes it different than, say, partially hydrogenated oils out there?

01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:04.680
 Well, the fact that they're partially hydrogenated means that there's still a lot of PUFA left in them.

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:18.680
 I think the defense of the idea of essential fatty acids, people are looking for anything to blame the toxic effects of margarine on.

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:32.680
 But for a long time, it's been clear that even partially hydrogenated vegetable oil still has enough PUFA in it to have toxic effects.

01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:41.680
 Wow, that's incredible. So do you actually think that there's any danger from just the trans fats themselves?

01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:49.680
 Oh, probably in a large amount, but I'm not exactly sure what it is,

01:40:49.680 --> 01:41:01.680
 because the research I've seen doesn't really clarify what it is they're doing that could be harmful.

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:05.680
 Would they possibly oxidize?

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:16.680
 Well, yeah, but less than the purely polyunsaturated fats, because they've already been partly hydrogenated.

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:21.680
 Very interesting. Thank you. I'm glad I asked.

01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:23.680
 Well, I appreciate the call.

01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:24.680
 Thank you.

01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:27.680
 No problem.

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:38.680
 And that was Clarence Ip, who did some of the first experiments showing a slight anti-cancer effect of the trans fatty acids.

01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:48.680
 Wow. Lots of great info in this show, Ray. Knocked it out of the park, in my opinion.

01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:49.680
 We have a couple minutes left.

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:54.680
 Do you have anything you want to elaborate in regards to just your work on dairy, your thoughts on dairy,

01:41:54.680 --> 01:42:00.680
 work on calcium, hormones, any of that stuff before we kind of shut it down for the day?

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:02.680
 Oh, no.

01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:05.680
 Oh, no?

01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:10.680
 Okay, well, Ray, once again, we really appreciate you taking the time out.

01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:15.680
 We have tons of listeners and followers that are really enjoying your information,

01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:20.680
 and I hope people are really respecting your time.

01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:25.680
 But I know people are really respecting your information, so once again, we just want to say thanks.

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:27.680
 Okay. Thank you.

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:28.680
 All right. You have a great weekend.

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:30.680
 Okay. Bye.

01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:32.680
 Bye.

01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:34.680
 All right, guys. Well, there you go.

01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:41.680
 About an hour and 45 minutes of Mr. Ray Peat talking about milk, calcium, hormones, fluoride, saturated fats,

01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:44.680
 everything and anything, and it was quite fascinating.

01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:50.680
 Like always, re-listen, re-listen, re-listen, re-listen, and re-listen to the show,

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:52.680
 because you can learn a lot.

01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:55.680
 Check out his articles on his website.

01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:56.680
 Lots of great info there.

01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:58.680
 You can order his books and his newsletter.

01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:04.680
 He's a little bit on back order because of the quantity of orders that he's getting.

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:10.680
 But tune into our Facebook page, Josh Rubin or Jeanne Rubin, or our Blog Talk Radio Show page

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:14.680
 or our YouTube page, you can get to that from our website, eastwesthaling.com.

01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:19.680
 For our next show, hopefully it will be in July, I'm trying to schedule a show to talk about serotonin,

01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:24.680
 tryptophan, and endotoxin in our GI system and how that affects our body.

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:28.680
 Don't forget, you can learn more about us at our website, eastwesthaling.com.
