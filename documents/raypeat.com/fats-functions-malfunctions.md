> (Shogomori, et al., 1993).

> reversing the polymerization caused by the PUFA (Sharon, et al., 2003).

> > When cancers are metastasizing, their phospholipids contain less stearic
> acid than the less malignant tumors (Bougnoux, et al., 1992), patients with

> organism is a "whirlwind of atoms," is probably more appropriate than
> "targeted signals and receptors" for understanding the physiology of fatty
> acids and phospholipids. The rate of change and renewal of these structural
> fats is very high. In rats, one study found a 30% decrease in the total
> phospholipid pool in the brain in the first 30 minutes after death (Adineh,
> et al., 2004). Another study in the brains of living rats found that a
> particular class of brain lipids, ethanolamine plasmalogens, had a turnover
> time of about 5 hours (Masuzawa, et al., 1984). (This type of lipid is an
> important component of the lipoproteins secreted by the liver into the serum
> [Vance, 1990], and is also a major lipid in the heart and brain.) Stresses

> fatty acid is unique in its combination of properties. The polyunsaturated
> fatty acids, made by plants (in the case of fish oils, they are made by

> This property probably explains why only palmitic acid functions as a

> unsaturated fats cause lung edema and respiratory failure.

> > The great difference in water/oil solubility affects the strength of
