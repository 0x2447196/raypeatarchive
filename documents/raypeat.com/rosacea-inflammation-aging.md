> **Rosacea, inflammation, and aging:** **The inefficiency of stress**

> _Rosacea, or acne rosacea, has been defined as "vascular and follicular
> dilation involving the nose and contiguous portions of the cheeks . . ."
> that may involve persistent erythema with hyperplasia of sebaceous glands._
> _ **Stedman's Medical Dictionary 23rd edition.**_

> > Light-skinned people, especially women between the ages of 30 and 50,
> sometimes develop a persistent redness of their cheeks and nose. It may
> begin as a tendency to flush excessively, but the blood vessels can become
> chronically dilated. Similar processes occur in dark-skinned people less
> frequently.

> The eyes are sometimes involved, with redness of the exposed areas
> (conjuctival hyperemia). New blood vessels develop in the area, and the flow
> of blood through the affected tissue is greatly increased. The tissues
> become thickened and fibrotic, with the multiplication of fibroblasts and
> the increased deposition of collagen.

> The cornea normally receives its oxygen from the air, and its nutrients from
> the aqueous humor. As rosacea of the eye develops, the blood vessels
> surrounding the cornea become increasingly visible, and, especially on the
> inner (nasal) side of the eye, the vessels tend to enlarge and become
> tortuous. Rhinophyma, or potato nose, has been described as a late
> development of rosacea.

> Too often, the medical reaction is to give the condition a name, and to
> distinguish its variants as if they were different problems, and then to use
> the most direct means to eliminate the problem they have defined.

> A typical attitude is that "Rosacea is an enigmatic disease with multiple
> exacerbations and remissions, and, unfortunately, treatment is directed
> toward symptomatic control rather than cure" (Randleman).

> Lasers or other radiation, caustic chemical abrasion, surgical planing and
> dermal shaves, and other forms of surgery may be used to destroy the
> superficial blood vessels, and to reduce the enlarged nose or other
> irregularities. A few decades ago, when rosacea was believed to be the
> result of a local infection, antibiotics were used to treat it, and some of
> them, including tetracycline, helped. It was discovered that some
> antibiotics have anti-inflammatory actions, apart from their germicidal
> effects, and now it is very common to prescribe the chronic use of
> tetracycline to suppress symptoms.

> Rosacea, and the fibrotic changes associated with it (pingueculae and
> pterygia in the eyes, rhinophyma of the nose, etc.), are much more than
> "cosmetic" issues, involving the skin and eye surface. If the invasive
> proliferation of blood vessels can be prevented, it's important to do that,
> because, for example, pannus/neovascularization of the cornea can seriously
> impair vision.

> But possibly the strangest thing about the relationship of the medical
> profession to rosacea is that its essential features, invasive
> neovascularization and fibrotic growth, are of great interest when they
> occur elsewhere, and many physiological processes are known to regulate the
> growth of blood vessels and fibroblasts, but nearly all the attention given
> to rosacea and rhinophyma concerns control of symptoms for cosmetic effect.
> Rosacea is a physiological problem that deserves consideration in the light
> of all that's known about physiology and developmental biology.

> The increased incidence of rosacea after the age of 30, and the fact that it
> occurs most commonly in the areas that are most exposed to sunlight (bald
> men sometimes develop it on the top of the head), indicate that aging and
> irritation are essential causes. Stress, irritation (such as produced by
> ultraviolet or ionizing radiation or free radicals), and aging are known to
> cause disorganized growth of fibrous and vascular tissues in various parts
> of the body. The occurrence of these processes at the surface, where the
> changes can be observed immediately, and without invasive procedures, should
> have aroused wide interest among those who study kidney disease, diabetes,
> and other degenerative diseases in which fibrosis and neovascularization
> play important roles.

> A localized stress or irritation at first produces vasodilation that
> increases the delivery of blood to the tissues, allowing them to compensate
> for the stress by producing more energy. Some of the agents that produce
> vasodilation also reduce oxygen consumption (nitric oxide, for example),
> helping to restore a normal oxygen tension to the tissue. Hypoxia itself
> (produced by factors other than irritation) can induce vasodilation, and if
> prolonged sufficiently, tends to produce neovascularization and fibrosis.

> Sensitivity to the harmful effects of light can be increased by some drugs
> and by excess porphyrins produced in the body (and by the porphyrin
> precursor, delta-amino levulinic acid), leading to rosacea, so those factors
> should be considered, but too often alcohol (which can cause porphyrin to
> increase) is blamed for rosacea and rhinophyma, without justification. There
> are many ways in which poor health can increase light sensitivity. Some
> types of excitation produced by metabolites (or by the failure of inhibitory
> metabolites) can produce vasodilation, involving the release of nitric oxide
> (Cardenas, et al., 2000), setting off a series of potentially pathological
> reactions, including fibrosis. The nitric oxide increases glycolysis while
> lowering energy production. The excitatory metabolite glutamate, and nitric
> oxide, are both inhibited by aspirin (Moro, et al., 2000).

> When blood flow in skin affected by rosacea was measured, circulation was 3
> or 4 times higher than normal (Sibenge & Gawkrodger, 1992), and oxygen
> tension may be increased. An inability to extract oxygen from the blood, or
> to use it to produce energy, will produce the same hyperemia that would be
> produced by a lack of oxygen. These measurements suggest that mitochondrial
> defects would be the best place to look for a general cause of rosacea.

> When mitochondria are damaged, active cells produce increased amounts of
> lactic acid, even in the presence of adequate oxygen. Otto Warburg
> identified this kind of metabolism, aerobic glycolysis, as an essential
> feature of cancer, and showed that it could be produced by stress, ionizing
> radiation, carcinogenic toxins, and even by a simple oxygen deficiency.
> Other investigators around the same time showed that lactic acid produces
> vasodilation (for example, in the cornea), and more recently it has been
> shown to promote the development of fibrosis, and it has been called a
> "phlogogen," a promoter of inflammation.

> Riboflavin, vitamin B2, is an essential component of the mitochondrial
> respiratory enzymes, and it is very easily destroyed by light (blue light
> and especially ultraviolet). When it is excited by high energy light, it can
> spread the damage to other components of the mitochondria, including the
> cytochromes and the polyunsaturated fatty acids. The other B vitamins are
> affected when riboflavin's actions are disturbed.

> Vitamin K is also extremely light sensitive, and it interacts closely with
> coenzyme Q in regulating mitochondrial metabolism. For example,
> mitochondrial Complex-I, NADH-ubiquinone reductase, is probably the most
> easily damaged part of the mitochondrion, and it is protected by vitamin K.
> Vitamin E, coenzyme Q, and the polyunsaturated fatty acids are also light
> sensitive, and they are more susceptible to free radical damage when vitamin
> K is deficient.

> Niacinamide, one of the B vitamins, provides energy to this mitochondrial
> system. Under stress and strong excitation, cells waste niacinamide-NADH,
> but niacinamide itself has a sedative antiexcitatory effect, and some of its
> actions resemble a hormone. Estrogen tends to interfere with the formation
> of niacin from tryptophan. Tryptophan, rather than forming the sedative
> niacin (pyridine carboxylic acid), can be directed toward formation of the
> excitatory quinolinic acid (pyridine dicarboxylic acid) by polyunsaturated
> fatty acids. Excitation must be in balance with a cell's energetic
> resources, and niacinamide can play multiple protective roles, decreasing
> excitation, increasing energy production, and stabilizing repair systems.
> The state of excitation and type of energy metabolism are crucial factors in
> governing cell functions and survival.

> The polyunsaturated fatty acids, besides their interactions with estrogen
> and tryptophan metabolism, promote excitation and decrease energy production
> in several other ways. For example, they increase the excitatory effects of
> the glutamate pathways (Yu, et al., 1986; Nishikawa, 1994), and their
> breakdown products inhibit mitochondrial respiration (Humphries, et al.,
> 1998; Picklo, et al., 1999; Lovell, et al., 2000).

> The excess excitation that produces nitric oxide and lactic acid lowers the
> energy production of vascular cells, possibly enough to lower their
> contractile ability (Geng, et al., 1992), causing vasodilation. When
> flushing is caused by a mismatch between energy supply and energy demand,
> caffeine can decrease the vasodilation (Eikvar & KirkebÃ¸en, 1998), but when
> vasodilation is caused more physiologically by carbon dioxide, caffeine
> doesn't have that effect (Meno, et al., 2005). In a study in which drinking
> hot water or coffee was compared with drinking room-temperature coffee or
> caffeine, it was found that the hot liquids caused flushing, but cool coffee
> and caffeine didn't.

> Caffeine increases cells' energy efficiency, and by opposing the effects of
> adenosine (secreted by cells that are stressed and energy-depleted), it can
> inhibit vasodilation, angioneogenesis (Merighi, et al., 2007; Ryzhov, et
> al., 2007), and fibrosis (Chan, et al., 2006).

> One nearly ubiquitous source of inappropriate excitation and energy
> depletion is the endotoxin, bacterial lipopolysaccharides absorbed from the
> intestine (Wang and White, 1999). That this ubiquitous toxin has a role in
> rosacea is suggested by the observation that intestinal stimulation, to
> speed transit through the bowel, immediately relieved symptoms (Kendall,
> 2002). Increased cortisol (Simon, et al., 1998) and sepsis (Levy, 2007)
> interfere with mitochondrial energy production.

> Simple nervous blushing or flushing is usually considered harmless, and when
> a person is overheated, the reddening of the skin has the function of
> facilitating heat loss, to restore a normal temperature. But even nerve-
> regulated flushing can involve a distinct interference with mitochondrial
> respiration, and can stimulate the overgrowth of blood vessels.

> Cancer's respiratory defect that Warburg identified, fermentation with
> lactic acid production even in the presence of adequate oxygen, was the
> result of some kind of injury to the mitochondria. He showed that one of the
> injuries that could produce aerobic glycolysis was a deficiency of
> riboflavin. He observed that tumors generally were anoxic, and that cancers
> typically appeared in the midst of tissue that was atrophying, and suggested
> that the cancer cells' survival was favored by their ability to live without
> oxygen. This may be relevant to the observations of many surgeons of a small
> cancer embedded in the fibrous tissue of large rhinophymas that have been
> removed.

> The relatively high incidence of rosacea among women (some studies indicate
> that it may be 3 times as common in women as in men) isn't likely to be the
> result of greater sun exposure, so it's reasonable to look for hormonal
> causes.

> In old age, it's well recognized that men's estrogen level rises. But the
> estrogen industry has convinced women that their estrogen declines as they
> get older. It's common knowledge that aging rodents often go into
> "persistent estrus," and that their estrogen levels generally increase with
> age (Parkening, et al., 1978; Anisimov and Okulov, 1981). Several studies in
> women have shown that serum estrogen levels rise from the teens into the 40s
> (Musey, et al., 1987; Wilshire, et al., 1995; Santoro, et al., 1996).

> Other studies show that serum and tissue estrogen concentrations are not
> concordant, and that some tissues may contain several times as much estrogen
> as the serum (Jefcoate, et al., 2001). Local irritation increases tissue
> estrogen content.

> The antiestrogens, especially progesterone, begin declining in the 30s, so
> that the rising estrogen has more effect on the tissues during those years.
> These are the years in which the incidence of rosacea rises suddenly.
> Rosacea develops later on average in men, whose estrogen levels rise
> significantly at later ages.

> Estrogen's most immediate effect on cells is to alter their oxidative
> metabolism. It promotes the formation of lactic acid. In the long run, it
> increases the nutritional requirements for the B vitamins, as well as for
> other vitamins. It also increases the formation of aminolevulinic acid, a
> precursor of porphyrin, and increases the risk of excess porphyrin
> increasing light sensitivity. Both aminolevulinic acid and excess porphyrins
> are toxic to mitochondria, apart from their photosensitizing actions. Nitric
> oxide, glutamate, and cortisol all tend to be increased by estrogen.

> Veins and capillaries are highly sensitive to estrogen, and women are more
> likely than men to have varicose veins, spider veins, leaky capillaries, and
> other vascular problems besides rosacea. Estrogen can promote
> angioneogenesis by a variety of mechanisms, including nitric oxide (Johnson,
> et al., 2006). "Estrogens potentiate corticosteroid effects on the skin such
> as striae, telangiectasiae, and rosacea dermatitis" (Zaun, 1981). Early
> forms of oral contraceptives, high in estrogen, were found to increase acne
> rosacea more than three-fold (Prenen & Ledoux-Corbusier, 1971).

> Lactic acid, produced under the influence of estrogen, nitric oxide, or
> other problems of energy formation, besides causing vasodilation, also
> stimulates the growth of fibroblasts. Oxygen deprivation, or damage to
> mitochondria, will increase lactic acid formation, and so it will
> immediately cause vasodilation, and if the problem is prolonged, new blood

> inflammatory and fibrotic conditions (for example, Cutolo, et al., 2003.
> Payne, et al., 2006, suggest the use of the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen, to
> treat rhinophyma.)

> The cornea normally contains more riboflavin even than the retina, which has
> a much higher rate of metabolism. When the cornea isn't able to get enough
> oxygen from the air for its needs (and if riboflavin is deficient, its need
> for oxygen is increased), surrounding blood vessels at first dilate in

> People suffering from rosacea have been found to be more likely than average

> Hypothyroidism has been identified as a factor in all of those. Good thyroid

> Szweda LI. During the progression of certain degenerative conditions,

> of increased free-radical generation and exhibit declines in respiratory
> function(s). It has therefore been suggested that oxidative damage to
> mitochondrial components plays a critical role in the pathology of these

> molecular targets of free-radical damage. A major product of lipid
> peroxidation, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), is highly cytotoxic and can readily
> react with and damage protein. In this study, the effects of HNE on intact
> cardiac mitochondria were investigated to gain insight into potential
> mechanisms by which free radicals mediate mitochondrial dysfunction.
> Exposure of mitochondria to micromolar concentrations of HNE caused rapid
> declines in NADH-linked but not succinate-linked state 3 and uncoupled
> respiration. The activity of complex I was unaffected by HNE under the
> conditions of our experiments. Loss of respiratory activity reflected the
> inability of HNE-treated mitochondria to meet NADH demand during maximum
