> **Growth hormone: Hormone of Stress, Aging, & Death?**

> The name "growth hormone" is misleading; stress produces somatic growth, in
> a process called "hormesis." Exercise produces muscle edema, to a degree
> similar to that produced by GH; edema stimulates growth, but GH effect isn't
> limited to bone and muscle.

> Identity of GH: Molecular ambiguity, complex modifications change one
> substance into many; its evolution suggests a role in water regulation.
> Doctrine of a "specific molecule" and "specific receptor" and specific
> effects is a myth.

> The osmoregulatory problem--keeping water under control--is centrally
> involved in stress.

> In mammals, the kidneys and bowel are the main regulators of water balance.

> GH is a stress hormone. Its effects can be produced osmotically, for example
> inducing milk production and cartilage growth, by osmotic (dilution) shock.

> Estrogen produces increased GH, and increases its production in stress.

> Nitric oxide is a pro-aging free radical induced by estrogen, releasing GH;
> all three produce edema.

> Behind edema, hypoxia, hypocarbia; free fatty acids, diabetes, vascular
> leakiness, degenerative kidney changes, connective tissue changes,
> thickened.basement membrane, retinal degeneration. The same changes occur in
> aging: increased permeability; kidney disease, connective tissue changes.

> The absence of GH protects kidneys against degeneration. Osteoarthritis, a
> characteristic aging condition, is caused by estrogen and GH.

> Some studies found that heart failure and bone repair aren't improved by GH;
> GH is very high during heart failure, in which edema contributes to the
> problem; carpal tunnel syndrome, myalgia, tumor growth, gynecomastia, and
> many other problems have been produced by GH treatments.

> Recently I heard Robert Sapolsky interviewed, and he was describing the
> changes that prepare the body for short-term stress. He said the energy-
> mobilizing hormones, adrenalin and cortisol, increase, while the hormones
> that don't contribute to meeting the immediate problem, including the sex
> hormones and growth hormone, are suppressed, to save energy; growth and
> reproductive processes can be suspended for the few minutes of acute stress,
> to make the body more able to meet its acute needs. He reiterated: Growth
> hormone is suppressed by stress.

> Sapolsky has done very interesting work on the suppression of testosterone
> by stress, and on the way in which brain cells are killed by prolonged
> exposure to glucocorticoids. He showed that if extra glucose is supplied,
> the brain cells can survive their exposure to cortisol. In the body,
> adrenalin and the glucocorticoids increase the availability of glucose.

> In the radio interview, he didn't have time for much detail, but it seemed
> to me that he wasn't talking about the same growth hormone that I have been
> reading about, and trying to understand, for years. Since people have asked
> me to write about the current anti-aging uses of GH, and its use in the
> dairy industry, Sapolsky's statements made me decide to think about some of
> the issues around the hormone.*

>
> ________________________________________________________________________________  
> *If Sapolsky had been talking about just mice and rats, his statement would
> have been generally accurate. Adrenaline stimulates rat pituitary cells to
> secrete GH, and since both increase the amount of free circulating fatty
> acids, it could be that rats' GH is suppressed by a fatty acid excess.

> The "growth hormone" was named long before it was actually found, and the
> substance with that name turns out to be involved in many processes other
> than growth. It is being given to cows to make them produce more milk, and
> it is being given to people with the purpose of making them lean and
> muscular, and with the hope of building stronger bones.  
> It isn't surprising that the Growth Hormone helps breasts develop and
> promotes milk production, since it is very similar to prolactin. GH and
> prolactin are members of a family of proteins that have diverged from each
> other in evolution, but they still have many overlapping effects.

> When GH is treated as a drug, it is supposed to have a discrete identity,
> based on the sequence of its amino acids. But the natural hormone
> (disregarding the existence of a variety of closely related peptides with
> slightly different amino acid composition) varies with time, being
> chemically modified even before it is secreted. For example, its acidic
> amino acids may be methylated, and its lysine groups may combine with sugars
> or carbon dioxide. The history of the protein in the body determines its
> exact structure, and therefore its biological effects.

> Male animals secrete GH in pulses, but females secrete it more steadily.
> This pattern of secretion "masculinizes" or "feminizes" the liver (and other
> organs), determining the pattern of enzyme activity. It would be possible
> (though very difficult) to arrange a system for delivering doses in a
> pulsed, intermittent manner. In cows, this apparently isn't necessary, since
> the purpose of the growth hormone is presumably to "feminize" the milk-
> producing system. But the normal pattern of secretion is much more complex
> than simply being "pulsed" or "continuous," since it, like prolactin
> secretion, is responsive to changes in thyroid, estrogen, diet, stress, and
> many other factors.  
>  
> For example, hormones in this family are, as far back in evolution as they
> have been studied, involved in the regulation of water and minerals. It is
> well established that increased water (hypotonicity) stimulates prolactin,
> and increased sodium inhibits its secretion. Growth hormone is also closely
> involved with the regulation of water and salts.

> One of the best known metabolic effects of GH is that, like adrenalin, it
> mobilizes fatty acids from storage. GH is known to antagonize insulin, and
> one of the ways it does this is simply by the ability of increased free
> fatty acids to block the oxidation of glucose. At puberty, the increased GH
> creates a mild degree of diabetes-like insulin resistance, which tends to
> increase progressively with age.  
>

> In his book, Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, Sapolsky acknowledges some
> situations in which GH is increased by stress in humans, but I think he
> misses the real ways in which it operates in stress. One of the interesting
> features of cortisol, which Sapolsky showed killed brain cells by making
> them unable to use glucose efficiently, is that it makes cells take up
> unsaturated fatty acids more easily, interfering with their energy
> production. Since growth hormone also has this kind of "diatebetogenic"
> action, it might be desirable to suppress its secretion during stress, but
> in fact, there are several kinds of stress that clearly increase its
> secretion, and in animals as different as fish, frogs, cows, and people it
> can be seen to play roles in water and salt regulation, growth and
> development, stress, and starvation.  
>

> Heat, hypoglycemia, running, and some types of shock are known to stimulate
> growth hormone secretion, sometimes to levels ten or twenty times higher
> than normal. (Two kinds of stress that usually don't increase GH are cold
> and stimulus-deprivation.) I consider the growth hormone to be, almost as
> much as prolactin, a stress-inducible hormone. That's why I reasoned that,

> A. V. Everitt, in his book on the hypothalamus and pituitary in aging,
