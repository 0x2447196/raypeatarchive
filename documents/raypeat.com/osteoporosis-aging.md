**Osteoporosis, aging, tissue renewal, and product science

** The incidence of osteoporosis, like obesity, has been increasing in recent
decades. The number of hip fractures in many countries has doubled in the last
30 or 40 years (Bergstrom, et al., 2009). An exception to that trend was
Australia in the period between 2001 and 2006, where the annual incidence of
hip fractures in women over 60 years old decreased by 28.3%. During those
years, the number of prescriptions for "hormone replacement therapy" decreased
by 54.6%, and the number of prescriptions for bisphosphonate increased by
245%. The publication of the Women's Health Initiative results in 2002
(showing that the Prem-Pro treatment caused breast cancer, heart attacks, and
dementia), led to a great decrease in the use of estrogen treatments
everywhere.  
After the FDA approved estrogen's use in 1972 for the prevention of
osteoporosis the number of women using it increased greatly, and by 1994, 44%
of women in the US had used it. After the WHI results were published, the
number of prescriptions for "HRT" fell by more than half, and following that
decrease in estrogen sales, the incidence of breast cancer decreased by 9% in
women between the ages of 50 and 54.  
With the incidence of hip fractures increasing while the percentage of women
using estrogen was increasing, it seems likely that there is something wrong
with the theory that osteoporosis is caused by an estrogen deficiency. That
theory was derived from the theory that menopause was the consequence of
ovarian failure, resulting from the failure to ovulate and produce estrogen
when the supply of eggs was depleted. The theory was never more than an
ideological preference, but the estrogen industry saw it as an opportunity to
create a huge market.  
There are many studies that seem to imply that the greater incidence of
osteoporotic fractures among women is the result of their exposure to estrogen
during their reproductive years. This would be analogous to the understanding
that it is the cumulative exposure to estrogen that ages the nerves in the
hypothalamus that control the cyclic release of the gonadotropic hormones,
causing the menopause.  
 **. . . the nature of science itself changed around the middle of the last
century, becoming product and disease oriented, so that now relatively few
people are continuing to study bones objectively.  
** Animal studies show that estrogen stunts growth, including bone growth. The
high estrogen levels in girls' teen years and early twenties accounts for the
fact that women's bones are lighter than men's. In rat studies, treatment with
estrogen was found to enlarge the space between the jawbone and the teeth,
which is a factor in periodontal disease (Elzay, 1964). Teeth are very similar
to bones, so it's interesting that treating male or female rats with estrogen
increases their incidence of tooth decay, and removing their gonads was found
to decrease the incidence (Muhler and Shafer, 1952). Supplementing them with
thyroid hormone decreased the incidence of cavities in both males and females
(Bixler, et al., 1957).  
One of the "estrogen receptors" appears to actively contribute to bone loss
(Windahl, et al., 1999, 2001). Studies in dogs following the removal of their
ovaries found that there was an increase of bone remodeling and bone formation
rate in the first month, followed by a few months of slowed bone formation,
but that by 10 months after the surgery the bones had returned to their normal
remodeling rate, and that "at no time was a significant reduction in bone
volume detected" (Boyce, et al., 1990). With the removal of the ovaries, the
production of progesterone as well as estrogen is affected, but the adrenal
glands and other tissues can produce those hormones.  
Until the influence of the estrogen industry overwhelmed it, ordinary science
was studying bone development in comprehensive ways, understanding its
biological roles and the influences of the environment on it. But the nature
of science itself changed around the middle of the last century, becoming
product and disease oriented, so that now relatively few people are continuing
to study bones objectively.  
The outstanding physical-chemical property of bone is that it is a reservoir-
buffer of carbon dioxide, able to bind huge amounts of the gas into its
structure.  
When carbon dioxide increases in the bloodstream it is at first absorbed
rapidly by the bones, and if the blood level of CO2 is kept high day after
day, the rate of absorption gradually slows down, but in experiments that have
continued for several weeks the bones were still slowly absorbing more carbon
dioxide; the absorption curve seems to be asymptotic. When people move to or
from high altitudes, their bones appear to continue adapting to the different
gas pressures for years. A reduction of atmospheric pressure (which allows the
tissues to retain more carbon dioxide) helps to reduce the calcium loss caused
by immobility (Litovka and Berezovs'ka, 2003; Berezovs'kyi, et al., 2000), and
promotes the healing of damaged bone (Bouletreau, et al., 2002). Ultrasound
treatment, which accelerates bone healing, stimulates processes similar to
reduced oxygen supply (Tang, et al., 2007).  
The mineral in newly formed bone is calcium carbonate, and this is gradually
changed to include a large amount of calcium phosphate. Besides forming part
of the mineral, carbon dioxide is also incorporated into a protein (in a
process requiring vitamin K), in a process that causes this protein,
osteocalcin, to bind calcium. The osteocalcin protein is firmly bonded to a
collagen molecule. Collagen forms about 30% of the mass of bone; several
percent of the bone consists of other organic molecules, including
osteocalcin, and the rest of the mass of the bone consists of mineral.  
Thyroid hormone is essential for forming carbon dioxide. In the early 1940s,
experimental rabbits were fed their standard diet, with the addition of 1%
desiccated thyroid gland, which would be equivalent to about 150 grains of
Armour thyroid for a person. They became extremely hypermetabolic, and
couldn't eat enough to meet their nutritional needs for growth and tissue
maintenance. When they died, all of their tissues weighed much less than those
of animals that hadn't received the toxic dose of thyroid, except for their
bones, which were larger than normal. Experiments with the thin skull bones of
mice have shown that the active thyroid hormone, T3, increases the formation
of bone. To increase cellular respiration and carbon dioxide production, T3
increases the activity of the enzyme cytochrome oxidase, which uses copper as
a co-factor. Increased thyroid activity increases the absorption of copper
from foods.  
There is an inherited condition in humans, called osteopetrosis or marble bone
disease, caused by lack of a carbonic anhydrase enzyme, which causes them to
retain a very high level of carbon dioxide in their tissues. Using a chemical
that inhibits carbonic anhydrase, such as the diuretic acetazolamide, a
similar condition can be produced in animals. Acetazolamide inhibits the bone
resorbing actions of parathyroid hormone, including lactic acid formation and
the release of the lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucuronidase (Hall and Kenny,
1987).  
While lactic acidosis causes bone loss, acidosis caused by increased carbonic
acid doesn't; low bicarbonate in the body fluids seems to remove carbonate
from the bone (Bushinsky, et al., 1993), and also mineral phosphates
(Bushinsky, et al., 2003). The parathyroid hormone, which removes calcium from
bone, causes lactic acid to be formed by bone cells (Nijweide, et al., 1981;
Lafeber, et al., 1986). Lactic acid produced by intense exercise causes
calcium loss from bone (Ashizawa, et al., 1997), and sodium bicarbonate
increases calcium retention by bone. Vitamin K2 (Yamaguchi, et al., 2003)
blocks the removal of calcium from bone caused by parathyroid hormone and
prostaglandin E2, by completely blocking their stimulation of lactic acid
production by bone tissues. Aspirin, which, like vitamin K, supports cell
respiration and inhibits lactic acid formation, also favors bone
calcification. Vitamin K2 stimulates the formation of two important bone
proteins, osteocalcin and osteonectin (Bunyaratavej, et al., 2009), and
reduces the activity of estrogen by oxidizing estradiol (Otsuka, et al, 2005).  
The formation of eggshell, which is mostly calcium carbonate, is analogous to
the early stage of bone formation. In hot weather, when chickens pant and
lower their carbon dioxide, they form thin shells. A sodium bicarbonate
supplement improves the quality of the eggshell (Balnave and Muheereza, 1997;
Makled and Charles, 1987). Chickens that habitually lay eggs with thinner
shells have lower blood bicarbonate than those that lay thick shelled eggs
(Wideman and Buss, 1985).  
One of the arguments for stopping the sale of DDT in the US was that it was
threatening to cause extinction of various species of bird because it caused
them to lay eggs with very weak shells. Several other synthetic estrogenic
substances, ethynylestradiol, lindane, PCBs, cause eggshell thinning, partly
by altering carbonic anhydrase activity (Holm, et al, 2006). Estrogen and
serotonin activate carbonic anhydrase in some tissues, progesterone tends to
inhibit it. DDE, a metabolite of DDT, reduces medullary bone formation in
birds (Oestricher, et al., 1971) and bone mineral density in men (Glynn, et
al., 2000). Among its estrogenic effects, DDE increases prolactin (Watson, et
al., 2007); one form of DDT inhibits progesterone synthesis and increases
estrogen (Wojtowics, et al., 2007)  
In youth, the mineralization of the collagen framework is slightly lower than
in maturity, and the bones are more flexible. With aging, the mineralization
increases progressively, and the proportion of collagen decreases slightly,
and the bones become increasingly brittle. (Rogers, et al., 1952; Mbuyi-
Muamba, et al., 1987).  
Collagen is a major part of the extracellular substance everywhere in the
body, and its concentration increases with aging in the non-calcified tissues.
There is considerable renewal and modification of collagen, as new molecules
are formed and old molecules broken down, but its average structure changes
with aging, becomes less soluble and more rigid, as the result of chemical
cross-links formed between molecules. These cross-links are involved in
regulating the differentiation of bone cells (Turecek, et al., 2008). Recently
(August 2, 2011), Deasey et al., have published evidence showing that cross-
linking is required for bone mineralization (2011).  
 **The outstanding physical-chemical property of bone is that it is a
reservoir-buffer of carbon dioxide, able to bind huge amounts of the gas into
its structure.**  
Around 1950, Fritz Verzar began studying the changes of collagen that occur
with aging, and his work led to the "collagen theory of aging." He showed that
older, stiffer, less elastic tendons have a higher "melting" or contracting
temperature than young tendons. (This effect is responsible for the curling of
a piece of meat when it is frying.)  
Verzar and his colleagues investigated the effects of hormonal treatments on
the aging of rat collagen, especially in their tail tendons. They found that
estrogen treatment increased the stiffness and the melting temperature of
collagenous tissues. While estrogen increased the cross-linking with aging,
removing the pituitary gland was found to retard the aging.  
Later, the cross-linking enzymes transglutaminase and lysyl oxidase, which are
induced by estrogen, were found to be a major factor in the cross-linking of
collagen and other molecules.  
When estrogen was found to age the connective tissues, it was assumed that
continual breeding during an animal's life-time, greatly increasing the total
exposure of the tissues to estrogen, would increase the aged rigidity of the
connective tissues, but these animals were found to have less rigid tissues.
During pregnancy other hormones, especially progesterone, were also increased,
and it was suggested that this reversed the effects of aging and estrogen.
Since most people had believed that frequent pregnancies would cause a woman
to age more rapidly, a large survey of records was done, to compare the
longevity of women with the number of pregnancies. It was found, in the very
extensive Hungarian records, that life-span was increased in proportion to the
number of pregnancies.  
Despite these very interesting results in the 1950s and 1960s, the growing
influence of the estrogen industry changed the direction of aging research,
favoring the belief that decreasing estrogen accelerated the deterioration of
tissues in aging, and the popularity of Denham Harman's "free radical theory
of aging" led many people to assume that random reactions produced by lipid
peroxidation were responsible for most of the cross-linking, and that theory
was gradually replaced by the "glycation" theory of aging, in which sugar
molecules break down and form the cross-links, by random, non-enzymic
processes. Estrogen's role in aging was completely by-passed.  
The meat industry is interested in reducing the toughness of meat, by
influencing the nature of the collagen in muscle. Castrated animals were found
to produce meat that was tenderer than that of intact males. When castrated
animals were treated with testosterone, the amount of collagen was increased,
making the meat tougher. But when dihydrotestoserone, which can't be converted
to estrogen was used, the meat didn't become tough. Treatment with estrogen
produced the same increase of collagen as treatment with testosterone, showing
that testosterone's effect was mainly the result of its conversion to estrogen
(Miller, et al., 1990).  
In the 1960s and '70s the estrogen industry was looking for ways to build on
the knowledge that in puberty estrogen is responsible for accelerating the
calcification of the growth plate at the ends of the long bones, and to find a
rationale for selling estrogen to all women concerned with the problems of
aging. As bone metabolism was investigated, two kinds of cell were found to be
active in constantly remodeling the bone structure: Osteoclasts (breaking it
down), and osteoblasts (building new bone). Estrogen was found to slow the
actions of the osteoclasts, so the idea that it would delay osteoporosis
became the basis for a huge new marketing campaign. Slowing bone metabolism
became the focus. Although estrogen was known to increase prolactin, and
prolactin was known to accelerate bone loss, nearly all publications began to
focus on substances in the blood or urine that corresponded to the rate of
bone turnover, with the implication that increasing bone turnover would
correspond to a net loss of bone.  
This was the context in which, during the 1980s, articles about thyroxine's
role in causing osteoporosis began to appear. The thyroid hormone supports
bone renewal, and increases indicators of bone breakdown in the blood and
urine. If estrogen's use was to be justified by slowing bone turnover, then
the effects of thyroid, accelerating bone turnover, should be interpreted as
evidence of bone destruction.  
A basic problem with many of the publications on thyroid and bone loss was
that they were talking about an unphysiological medical practice (prescribing
the pre-hormone, thyroxine), which frequently failed to improve thyroid
function, and could even make it worse, by lowering the amount of T3 in the
tissues.  
Later, it was noticed that high TSH was associated with the signs of lower
bone turnover. TSH rises when there is less thyroid hormone, but (after the
recombinant TSH became available for medical use) a few publications argued
that it was the TSH itself, rather than the absence of thyroid hormone, that
was "protecting" the bones (lowering the evidence of bone turnover). The
doctrine that had been developed to support estrogen therapy was now used to
oppose thyroid therapy. Keeping the TSH high would slow bone turnover.  
Working in this cultural context, genetic engineers at Amgen identified a
protein that inhibited the formation of osteoclast cells, and slowed bone
metabolism. It was suggested that it was responsible for estrogen's
suppression of the osteoclasts, and many publications appeared showing that it
was increased by estrogen. It was named "osteoprotegerin," meaning "the bone
protecting protein." Prolactin increases osteoprotegerin (OPG), reducing bone
resorption just as estrogen does. Serotonin also increases OPG, and it turns
out that OPG is elevated in all of the pathological conditions associated with
high serotonin, including cancer, pulmonary artery hypertension, vascular
calcification, and even bone loss.  
While Arthur Everitt, Verzar, and others were studying the effects of the
rat's pituitary (and other glands) on collagen, W. D. Denckla investigated the
effects of reproductive hormones and pituitary removal in a wide variety of
animals, including fish and mollusks. He had noticed that reproduction in
various species (e.g., salmon) was quickly followed by rapid aging and death.
Removing the pituitary gland (or its equivalent) and providing thyroid
hormone, he found that animals lacking the pituitary lived much longer than
intact animals, and maintained a high metabolic rate. Making extracts of
pituitary glands, he found a fraction (closely related to prolactin and growth
hormone) that suppressed tissue oxygen consumption, and accelerated the
degenerative changes of aging.  
Aging, estrogen, cortisol, and a variety of stresses, including radiation and
lipid peroxidation, chemically alter collagen, producing cross-links that
increase its rigidity, and affect the way it binds minerals. The cross-linking
enzymes induced by estrogen are involved in the normal maturation of bone
collagen, and at puberty when estrogen increases, bone growth is slowed, as
the cross-linking and mineralization are accelerated. With aging and the
accumulation of heavy metals and polyunsaturated fats, random oxidative
processes increase the cross-linking. In bones, the relatively large masses of
cartilage absorb oxygen and nutrients slowly, so internally the amount of
oxygen is very limited, about 1/5 as much as at the surface, and this low
oxygen tension is an important factor in regulating growth, differentiation,
cross-linking, and calcification, maintaining bone integrity. But in blood
vessels the connective tissues are abundantly supplied with oxygen and
nutrients; this is normally a factor regulating the production of collagen and
its cross-linking, and preventing calcification.  
When the factors promoting collagen synthesis and maturation are increased
systemically, with aging and stress, the excess cross-linking slows the
biological renewal process in bones, but in blood vessels the same processes
creating excess cross-linking initiate a calcification process, involving the
various factors that in youth are responsible for normal maturation of bone.  
Prolactin, like estrogen, interferes with thyroid function and oxygen
consumption (Wade, et al., 1986; Strizhkov, 1991; Spatling, et al., 1982).
Many years ago, repeated lactation was considered to cause osteoporosis and
loss of teeth, and prolactin, which mobilizes calcium from bones for the
production of milk, was recognized as an important factor in bone loss. Drugs
that increase prolactin were found to cause osteoporosis. In the 40 years
since the drug industry began its intense promotion of estrogen to prevent and
treat osteoporosis, there has been very little attention to the fact that
estrogen increases prolactin, which contributes to osteoporosis, but some
people (e.g., Horner, 2009) have noticed that oral contraceptives and
menopausal hormone treatments have damaged the bones of the inner ear, causing
otosclerosis and impaired hearing, and have suggested that prolactin mediates
the effect.  
A few years ago, the "serotonin reuptake inhibitor" antidepressants, already
known to increase prolactin by increasing the effects of serotonin, were found
to be causing osteoporosis after prolonged use. Estrogen increases serotonin,
which besides promoting the secretion of prolactin, also stimulates the
production of parathyroid hormone and cortisol, both of which remove calcium
from bone, and contribute to the calcification of blood vessels. The
association between weakened bones and hardened arteries is now widely
recognized, but researchers are being careful to avoid investigating any
mechanisms that could affect sales of important drug products, especially
estrogen and antidepressants.  
Following the recognition that the SSRI drugs were causing osteoporosis, it
was discovered that the serotonin produced in the intestine causes bone loss,
and that inhibiting intestinal serotonin synthesis would stop bone loss and
produce a bone building anabolic effect (Inose, et al., 2011). One group that
had been concentrating on the interactions of genes commented that,
recognizing the effects of intestinal serotonin, they had suddenly become
aware of "whole organism physiology" (Karsenty and Gershon, 2011).  
In previous newsletters I have talked about the ability of intestinal
irritation and the associated increase of serotonin to cause headaches,
asthma, coughing, heart and blood vessel disease, muscular dystrophy, flu-like
symptoms, arthritis, inflammation of muscles and nerves, depression, and
inflammatory brain diseases. With the new recognition that serotonin is a
basic cause of osteoporosis, intestinal health becomes a major issue in aging
research.  
The protein that inhibits intestinal formation of serotonin is the low density
lipoprotein receptor-related protein. This seems likely to have something to
do with the fact that "low" HDL is associated with better bones. A low level
of LDL is associated with increased vertebral fractures (Kaji, et al., 2010).  
Cartilage synthesis and turnover are highest at night. It is inhibited by
metabolic acidosis (increased lactic acid), but not by respiratory acidosis
(CO2) (Bushinsky, 1995). Since most calcium is lost from bone during the night
(Eastell, et al., 1992; even in children: DeSanto, et al., 1988) in
association with the nocturnal rise of the catabolic substances, such as free
fatty acids, cortisol, prolactin, PTH, and adrenalin, things which minimize
the nocturnal stress can decrease the bone turnover. These include calcium
(Blumsohn, et al., 1994) and sugar. Catabolic substances and processes
increase with aging, especially at night. Babies grow most during the night
when bone turnover is high, and even a daytime nap accelerates collagen
turnover (Lutchman, et al., 1998).  
Discussions about whether a certain person's osteoporosis is "menopausal
osteoporosis" or "senile osteoporosis" have neglected the possibility that
osteoporosis doesn't begin in either menopause or old age, but that it is the
result of life-long developmental processes that interact with all the factors
that are involved in aging. The fact that the collagen content of old bone is
lower than in young bone (as a percentage of bone weight) shows that the
problem in osteoporosis isn't a lack of calcification, it's a deficiency of
tissue renewal, parallel to sarcopenia, the decrease of muscle mass with
aging. Systemically decreased tissue renewal would account for the association
of bone loss with other processes such as male baldness (Morton, et al., 2007)
and Alzheimer's disease (Zhou, et al., 2011, Duthie, et al., 2011).  
A high level of respiratory energy production that characterizes young life is
needed for tissue renewal. The accumulation of factors that impair
mitochondrial respiration leads to increasing production of stress factors,
that are needed for survival when the organism isn't able to simply produce
energetic new tissue as needed. Continually resorting to these substances
progressively reshapes the organism, but the investment in short-term
survival, without eliminating the problematic factors, tends to exacerbate the
basic energy problem. This seems to be the reason that Denckla's animals,
deprived of their pituitary glands, but provided with thyroid hormone, lived
so long: they weren't able to mobilize the multiple defenses that reduce the
mitochondria's respiratory energy production.  
Several things that the geneticists would never be able to fit into their
schemes of "bone regulatory molecules" such as OPG, growth hormone,
parathyroid hormone, and estrogen, fit neatly with the idea that bone health
is maintained by respiratory energy and tissue renewal, under the influence of
thyroid hormone. For example, adrenaline, which is increased by stress, aging,
and hypothyroidism (and in many cases by estrogen), causes bone loss. Even the
bone loss caused by immobility can be blocked by an adrenaline blocker such as
propranolol. (The stress of immobility also famously increases serotonin.)
Adrenaline tends to decrease carbon dioxide and increase lactic acid, and it
strongly increases parathyroid hormone (Ljunhgall S, et al., 1984).  
Calcium activates mitochondrial respiration, and lowers adrenaline (Luft, et
al., 1988), parathyroid hormone (Ohgitani, et al., 1997), and prolactin (Kruse
and Kracht, 1981). Copper, which is the co-factor for the cytochrome C oxidase
enzyme, activated by thyroid, is essential for bone formation and maintenance,
and is consistently deficient in osteoporosis. Thyroid hormone increases the
body's ability to assimilate copper.  
Aspirin, which stimulates bone formation, has other thyroid-like actions,
including activation of mitochondrial respiration and energy production, with
an increase of cytochrome C oxidase (Cai, et al., 1996), and it lowers
serotonin (Shen, et al., 2011). It also apparently protects against
calcification of the soft tissues, (Vasudev, et al., 2000), though there has
been surprisingly little investigation of that. "Aspirin can promote
trabecular bone remodeling, improve three-dimensional structure of trabecular
bone and increase bone density of cancellous in osteoporotic rats by
stimulating bone formation. It may become a new drug for the treatment of
osteoporosis" (Chen, et al., 2011).  
A wide range of inflammatory mediators that accelerate inflammation and bone
loss also inhibit thyroid function. People who ate more polyunsaturated fat,
which inhibits thyroid and oxidative metabolism, were several times more
likely to have osteoporotic fractures (that is, essentially spontaneous
fractures) than people who ate the least (Martinez-Ramirez, et al., 2007).  
Arachidonic acid stimulates prolactin secretion, and prolactin acts on the
thyroid gland to decrease its activity, and on other tissues to increase their
glycolysis (with lactate production), while decreasing oxidative metabolism
(Spatling, et al., 1982; Strizhkov, 1991).  
Living at high altitude, which strengthens bones, increases thyroid activity
and decreases prolactin (Richalet, et al., 2010) and parathyroid hormone
(Khan, et al., 1996). It lowers free fatty acids, which lower bone mass by
reducing bone formation and increasing bone resorption (Chen, et al., 2010).
In menopausal women, polyunsaturated fatty acids and even monounsaturated fats
are associated with bone loss, fruit and vegetable consumption protects
against bone loss (Macdonald, et al., 2004).  
While it's very interesting that the drug propranol which blocks adrenaline,
and drugs that block serotonin formation, have bone protective and restorative
effects, they also have undesirable side effects. Food choices that optimize
oxidative metabolism are the safest, as well as the most economical, way to
approach the problem of osteoporosis and other degenerative changes. A person
can easily perceive changes in appetite, quality of sleep, changes in skin,
hair, and mood, etc., but blood tests could be used to confirm that the right
choices were being made. Tests for vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, free fatty
acids, and CO2/bicarbonate, as well as the hormones, can be helpful, if a
person isn't sure whether their diet, sunlight exposure, and thyroid
supplementation is adequate.  
The popular medical understanding of the organism is based on a mechanistic
view of causality, in which genes have a central role, causing things to
develop and function in certain ways, and that hormones and drugs can cause
genes to increase or decrease their activity. Genes that build bones can be
activated by one substance, and genes that tear down bones can be inhibited by
another substance. The "osteoprotegerin" story illustrates the problem with
that kind of thinking.  
Vernadsky's description of an organism as a "whirlwind of atoms" is probably a
better way to think of how "causality" works. The moving air in a whirlwind
forms a self-intensifying system, with the motion reducing the pressure,
causing more air to be drawn into the system. The atoms moving in coordination
aren't acting as separate things, but as parts in a larger thing. The way in
which increased metabolism in the bones acts favorably on the metabolism of
kidneys, blood vessels, lungs, liver, digestive system, etc., which in turn
favors the bones' renewal, is analogous to the tendency of a whirlwind to
intensify as long as there is a source of energy. **The intensity of oxidative
metabolism is the basic factor that permits continuing coordination of
activity, and the harmonious renewal of all the components of the organism.

it targets cells in the hypothalamic ventromedial nuclei and through them it
reduces oestrogenic activity by promoting osteoblast-suppressing adrenergic
activity. Second, it stimulates vascular and heart valve ossification, which
leads to such events as heart failure and diabetic limb amputations.
