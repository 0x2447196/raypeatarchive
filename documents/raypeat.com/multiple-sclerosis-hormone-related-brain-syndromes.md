>
> **THE ARGUMENT:**
>
> 1) The hormones pregnenolone, thyroid, and estrogen are involved in several
> ways with the changes that occur in multiple sclerosis, but no one talks
> about them.
>
> 2) The process of myelination is known to depend on the thyroid hormone. The
> myelinating cells are the oligodendroglia (oligodendrocytes) which appear to
> stop functioning in MS (and sometimes to a milder degree in Alzheimer's
> disease, and other conditions). The cells' absorption of thyroid hormone is
> influenced by dietary factors.
>
> 3) The oligodendrocytes are steroid-producing cells (1), and steroidogenesis
> is dependent on thyroid hormone, and on thyroid-dependent respiratory
> enzymes and on the heme-enzyme P-450scc, which are all sensitive (2) to
> poisoning by carbon monoxide and cyanide. The steroid produced by the
> oligodendrocytes is pregnenolone, which is known to have a profound anti-
> stress action (3), and which appears to be the main brain-protective
> steroid.
>
> 4) Lesions resembling those of MS can be produced experimentally by carbon
> monoxide or cyanide poisoning.(4) The lesions tend to be associated with
> individual small blood vessels, which are likely to contain clots. (Since
> all animals have enzymes to detoxify cyanide, this poison is apparently a
> universal problem, and can originate in the bowel. "Detoxified" cyanide is
> still toxic to the thyroid.)
>
> 5) Pregnenolone and progesterone protect against nerve damage (5) by the
> excitotoxic amino acids (glutamic acid, aspartic acid, monosodium glutamate,
> aspartame, etc.), while estrogen (6) and cortisol (7) are nerve-destroying,
> acting through the excitotoxic amino acids. Excitotoxins destroy certain
> types of nerve, especially the dopaminergic and cholinergic types, leaving
> the noradrenergic types (8), paralleling the changes that occur in aging.
> The clustering of oligodendrocytes around deteriorating nerve cells could
> represent an adaptive attempt to provide pregnenolone to injured nerve
> cells.
>
> 6) The involvement of hormones and environmental factors probably accounts
> for the intermittent progress of multiple sclerosis. To the extent that the
> environmental factors can be corrected, the disease can probably be
> controlled.
>

>
> **SHORT-DAY BRAIN STRESS**
>
> Shortly after I moved from Mexico to Montana, one of my students, a 32 year
> old woman, began having the same sensory symptoms her older sister had
> experienced at the same age, at the onset of multiple sclerosis. Vertigo and
> visual distortions of some sort made her consider withdrawing from the
> university. I'm not sure why she tried eating a whole can of tuna for lunch
> a couple of days after the onset of symptoms, but it seemed to alleviate the
> symptoms, and she stayed on a high protein diet and never had a recurrence.
> She told me some of the lore of MS: That it mostly affects young adults
> between the ages of 20 and 40, that it is common in high latitudes and
> essentially unknown in the tropics, and that it is sometimes exacerbated by
> pregnancy and stress. (Later, I learned that systemic lupus erythematosis
> and other "auto-immune" diseases also tend to occur mainly during the
> reproductive years. I discussed some of the implications of this in "Bean
> Syndrome.")
>
> Having enjoyed the mild climate of Mexico, I became very conscious of the
> harm done to us by northern winters, and began developing the idea of
> "winter sickness." In 1966-67, allergies, PMS, weight gain, colitis, and
> arthritis came to my attention as winter-related problems, and I assumed
> that the high-latitude incidence of MS related to what I was seeing and
> experiencing. Studies in Leningrad began revealing that mitochondria are
> injured during darkness, and repaired during daylight. I observed that
> hamsters' thymus glands shrank in the winter and regenerated in the summer;
> shrinkage of the thymus gland is a classical feature of stress, and usually
> reflects the dominance of cortisone, though estrogen and testosterone also
> cause it to shrink. Winter's darkness is stressful in a very fundamental
> way, and like any stress it tends to suppress thyroid function. In the
> hypothyroid state, any estrogen which is produced tends to accumulate in the
> body, because of liver sluggishness.
>
> I began to see that PMS could be controlled by certain things--extra light,
> supplements of sodium and magnesium, high quality protein, and correction of
> deficiencies of thyroid and progesterone. In working on my dissertation, I
> saw that tissue hypoxia (lower than optimal concentrations of oxygen in the
> blood) may result from estrogen excess, vitamin E deficiency, or aging.
> There is a close biological parallel between estrogen-dominance and the
> other hypoxic states, such as stress/shock, and aging.
>
> **ESTROGEN'S EFFECTS**
>
> As a portrait painter, I had been very conscious of the blue aspect that can
> often be seen in the skin of young women. In pale areas, the color may
> actually be blue, and in areas with a rich supply of blood, such as the
> lips, the color is lavender during times of high estrogen influence--around
> ovulation and puberty, for example. During these times of estrogen
> dominance, the blood is not only poorly oxygenated, but it has other special
> properties, such as an increased tendency to clot. The Shutes' work in the
> 1930s began with the use of vitamin E to antagonize estrogen's clot-
> promoting tendency, and led them to the discovery that vitamin E can be very
> therapeutic in heart disease. More recently, it has been found that men with
> heart disease have abnormally high estrogen (9), that women using oral
> contraceptives have higher mortality from heart attacks (10), and that
> estrogen tends to promote spasm of blood vessels (11). (These reactions are
> probably related to the physiology of menstruation, in which progesterone
> withdrawal causes spasms in the spiral arteries of the uterus, producing
> endometrial anoxia and cell death.)
>
> In toxemia of late pregnancy, or eclampsia, the exaggerated clotting
> tendency caused by excess estrogen (or by inadequately opposed estrogen,
> i.e., progesterone deficiency), can cause convulsions and strokes. Vascular
> spasms could be involved here, too. The stasis caused by the vasospasm would
> facilitate clotting. (Vascular spasm has been observed in epilepsy, too.
> Epilepsy can be brought on by the premenstrual excess of estrogen, and in
> that situation there is no evidence that clotting is involved. Leakage of
> hemoglobin out of red cells can cause vasospasm, so bleeding, clotting,
> strokes, and seizures can interact complexly.) The brains of women who have
> died following eclampsia show massive clotting in the blood vessels, and
> their livers are characteristically injured, with clots (12).
>
> Tom Brewer and others have shown very clearly that malnutrition, especially
> protein deficiency, is the cause of toxemia of late pregnancy. (In Nutrition
> for Women, I discussed the importance of protein in allowing the liver to
> eliminate estrogen.)
>
> Various researchers have demonstrated that the plaques of MS usually occur
> in the area served by a single blood vessel (13, 14), and some have
> suggested that clotting is the cause. MS patients have been found to have an
> abnormal clotting time, and it has been suggested that an altered diet might
> be able to correct the clotting tendency.
>
> Studies in animals have shown clearly that a protein deficiency increases
> the fibrinogen content of blood. (Field and Dam, 1946.) Other factors that
> increase blood clotting are elevated adrenalin and cortisone. Protein
> deficiency causes an adaptive decrease in thyroid function, which leads to a
> compensatory increase in adrenaline and cortisone. The combination of high
> estrogen with high adrenaline increases the tendency for both clots and
> spasms of the blood vessels (11).
>
> In experimental poisoning of animals with carbon monoxide or cyanide, the
> brain lesions resembling MS include blood clots. The patchy distribution of
> these spots in the brain suggests that the clotting is secondary to
> metabolic damage in the brain. Presumably, the same would be true in
> ordinary MS, with clots and spasms being induced in certain areas by
> metabolic abnormalities in brain cells. The injured cells that are
> responsible for myelination of nerve fibers are steroid-forming cells. A
> failure to secrete their protective pregnenolone could cause a local spasm
> of a blood vessel. The circulatory problem would exacerbate the respiratory
> problem. Steroid production is dependent on NADH and NADPH, and so requires
> adequate energy supplies and energy metabolism. The phenomenon of blood-
> sludging, studied by M. Knisely at the University of Chicago in the l930s
> and l940s, is apparently a general result of decreased energy metabolism,
> and is likely to be a factor in energy-and-circulatory vicious circles.

> **SYMPTOMS AND THERAPIES**
>
> Around 1976 I met a woman in her mid-thirties who heard about my work with
> progesterone in animals. She had been disabled by a brain disease that
> resembled MS or Devic's disease, inflammation of the optic nerves. It would
> sometimes cause blindness and paralysis that persisted for weeks at a time.
> During remissions, sometimes using a wheelchair, she would go to the medical
> school library to try to understand her condition. She came across Katherina
> Dalton's work with progesterone, and convinced a physician to give her a
> trial injection. Although she had trouble finding people who were willing to
> give her progesterone, her recovery was so complete that she was able to
> climb stairs and drive her car, and she came to my endocrinology class and
> gave a very good (and long) lecture on progesterone therapy. Although her
> sensory and motor functions became normal, she remained very fat, and
> chronically suffered from sore areas on her arms and legs that seemed to be
> abnormal blood vessels, possibly with phlebitis. She appeared to need
> thyroid hormone as well as larger amounts of progesterone, but never found a
> physician who would cooperate, as far as I know.
>
> In the late 1970s I was seeing a lot of people who had puzzling health
> problems. In a period of two or three years, there were five people who had
> been diagnosed by neurologists as having multiple sclerosis. In talking to
> them, it seemed clear that they had multiple symptoms of hypothyroidism.
> They weren't severely disabled. Since they weren't fat or lethargic, their
> physicians hadn't thought they could be hypothyroid. When they tried taking
> a thyroid supplement, all of their symptoms disappeared, including those
> that had led to their MS diagnosis. One of the women went to her doctor to
> tell him that she felt perfectly healthy since taking thyroid, and he told
> her to stop taking it, because people who have MS need a lot of rest, and
> she wouldn't get enough rest if she was living in a normally active way. The
> assumption seemed to be that the diagnosis was more important than the
> person. (When I refer to a "thyroid supplement" I mean one that contains
> some T3. Many people experience "neurological symptoms" when they take
> thyroxine by itself. Experimentally, it has been found to suppress brain
> respiration, probably by diluting the T3 that was already present in the
> brain tissue.)
>
> ****
>
> **METABOLISM OF THE OLIGODENDROCYTES**
>
> The rate-regulating step in steroid synthesis involves the entry of
> cholesterol into the mitochondria, where the heme-enzyme P-450scc then
> removes the side-chain of cholesterol (by introducing oxygen atoms), to
> produce pregnenolone. This enzyme can be poisoned by carbon monoxide or
> cyanide, and light can eliminate the poison (15); this could be one aspect
> of the winter-sickness problem.
>
> Peripheral nerves are myelinated by essentially the same sort of cell that
> is called an oligodendrocyte in the brain, but outside the brain it is
> called a Schwann cell. It is easier to study the myelin sheath in peripheral
> nerves, and the electrical activity of a nerve is the most easily studied
> aspect of its physiology. Certain experiments seemed to indicate a "jumping"
> (saltatory) kind of conduction along the nerve between Schwann cells, and it
> was argued that the insulating function of the myelin sheath made this kind
> of conduction possible. This idea has become a standard item in physiology
> textbooks, and its familiarity leads many people to assume that the presence
> of myelin sheaths in the brain serves the same "insulating" function.
>
> For a long time it has been known that heat production during nerve
> conduction reveals a more continuous mode of conduction, that doesn't
> conform to the idea of an electrical current jumping around an insulator.
> Even if the myelin functioned primarily to produce "saltatory conduction" in
> peripheral nerves, it isn't clear how this process could function in the
> brain. I think of the issue of "saltatory conduction at the nodes of
> Ranvier" as another of the fetish ideas that have served to obstruct
> progress in biology in the United States. A more realistic approach to nerve
> function can be found in Gilbert Ling's work. Ling has demonstrated in many
> ways that the ruling dogma of "cell membrane" function isn't coherently
> based on fact. He found that hormones such as progesterone regulate the
> energetic and structural stability of cells. Many people, unaware of his
> work, have felt that it was necessary to argue against the idea that there
> are anesthetic steroids with generalized protective functions, because of
> their commitment to a textbook dogma of "cell membrane" physiology.
>
> I think the myelinating cells do have relevance to nerve conduction, but I
> don't think they serve primarily as electrical insulators. If the adrenal
> cortex were inside the heart, it would be obvious to ask whether its
> hormones aren't important for the heart's function. Since the
> oligodendrocytes are steroid-synthesizers, it seems obvious to ask whether
> their production of pregnenolone in response to stress or fatigue isn't
> relevant to the conduction processes of the nerves they surround.

> **OLD AGE**
>
> A biologist friend of mine who was about 85 became very senile. His wife
> started giving him thyroid, progesterone, DHEA and pregnenolone, and within
> a few days his mental clarity had returned. He continued to be mentally
> active until he was 89, when his wife interfered with his access to the
> hormones.
>
> In old age the brain steroids fall to about 5% of their level in youth.
> Pregnenolone and DHEA improve memory in old rats, and improve mood stability
> and mental clarity of old people. Pregnenolone's action in improving the
> sense of being able to cope with challenges probably reflects a quieting and
> coordinating of the "sequencing" apparatus of the forebrain, which is the
> area most sensitive to energy deprivation. This is the area that
> malfunctions in hyperactive and "dyslexic" children. Weakening of the
> sequencing and sorting processes probably explains the common old-age
> inability to extract important sounds from environmental noise, creating a
> kind of "confusion deafness." Insomnia, worry and "restless legs" at bedtime
> are problems for many old people, and I think they are variations of the
> basic energy-depletion problem.
>
> The oligodendrocytes were reported (Hiroisi and Lee, 1936) to be the source
> of the senile plaques or amyloid deposits of Alzheimer's disease.(16)
> Hiroisi and Lee showed the cells in different stages of degeneration, ending
> with translucent "mucoid" spots that stained the same as amyloid, the
> material in the senile plaques. This type of cell also appears to form a
> halo or crown around degenerating nerve cells--possibly in a protective
> reaction to provide the nerve cell with any pregnenolone the
> oligodendrocytes are able to make. The oligodendrocytes, the source of the
> brain steroids (that people previously believed came from the adrenals and
> gonads, and were just stored in the brain), myelinate nerve fibers under the
> influence of thyroid hormone (17). Thyroid is responsible for both
> myelination and hormone formation. In old age, glial cells become more
> numerous, and nerve cells become structurally and functionally abnormal, but
> usually there is no problem with the formation of myelin. In MS, the problem
> is just with myelination, and there are no senile plaques or defects in the
> nerve cells themselves.
>
> These differences suggest the possibility that Alzheimer's disease involves
> a specific premature loss of brain pregnen- olone production, but not of
> thyroid. Recent work suggests a central role for pregnenolone and
> progesterone in the regulation of consciousness (18), and possibly in the
> brain's detoxifying system. Elsewhere, I have suggested that vitamin A
> deficiency might cause the excessive production of the "amyloid" protein. A
> vitamin A deficiency severely inhibits steroid synthesis. (It is used so
> massively in steroid synthesis that a progesterone supplement can prevent
> the symptoms of vitamin A deficiency.) I suspect that vitamin A is necessary
> for the side-chain cleavage that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone. Iron-
> stimulated lipid peroxidation is known to block steroid formation, and
> vitamin A is very susceptible to destruction by iron and oxidation. Iron
> tends to accumulated in tissues with aging. Gajdusek has demonstrated that
> brain deterioration is associated with the retention of whatever metal
> happens to be abundant in the person's environment, not just with aluminum.
> (One type of glial cell is known for its metal-binding function, causing
> them to be called "metallophils."). According to Gajdusek, "calcium and
> other di- and trivalent elements" are "deposited as hydroxyapatites in brain
> cells" in brain degeneration of the Alzheimer's type.(19)
>
> Even early forms of Alzheimer's disease begin at an age when the youth-
> associated steroids have begun to decline. If MS involves a deficiency of
> thyroid (or of T3 within the oligodendrocytes, where T3 normally can be made
> from thyroxine; many things, including protein deficiency, can block the
> conversion of T4 to T3), those cells would necessarily be deficient in their
> ability to produce pregenolone, but in young people the brain would still be
> receiving a little pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA from the adrenals
> and gonads. This relatively abundant youthful supply of hormones would keep
> most of the body's organs in good condition, and could keep the bodies of
> the major brain cells from deteriorating. But if proper functioning of the
> nerve fibers requires that they be fed a relatively high concentration of
> pregnenolone from their immediately adjacent neighbors (with the amount
> increasing during stress and fatigue), then their function would be impaired
> when they had to depend on the hormones that arrived from the blood stream.
>
> For many years it has been recognized that the brain atrophy of "Alzheimer's
> disease" resembles the changes seen in the brain in many other situations:
> The traumatic dementia of boxers; toxic dementia; the slow-virus diseases;
> exposure of the brain to x-rays (20); ordinary old age; and in people with
> Down's syndrome who die around the age of thirty.
>
> In menopause, certain nerve cells have lost their ability to regulate the
> ovaries, because of prolonged exposure to estrogen (6). The cells that fail
> as a result of prolonged estrogen exposure aren't the same cells that fail
> from prolonged exposure to the glucocorticoids (7), but they have in common
> the factor of excitatory injury.
>
> Since people who experience premature menopause are known to be more likely
> than average to die prematurely, it is reasonable to view menopause as a
> model of the aging process. It is now well established that progesterone
> fails to be produced at the onset of menopause (the first missed period,
> increased loss of calcium, symptoms such as hot flashes, etc.), and that
> estrogen continues to be produced at monthly intervals for about four years.
> The essential question for aging, in the present context, is why the
> anesthetic steroids are no longer produced at a rate that allows them to
> protect tissues, including brain cells, from the excitotoxins. Using
> menopause as a model for aging, we can make the question more answerable by
> asking why progesterone stops being produced.
>
> During stress, we are designed not to get pregnant, and the simplest aspect
> of this is that ACTH, besides stimulating the adrenals to produce stress-
> related hormones, inhibits the production of progesterone by the ovary.
> Other stress-induced factors, such as increased prolactin and decreased
> thyroid, also inhibit progesterone production. Stress eventually makes us
> more susceptible to stress. Menopause and other landmarks of aging simply
> represent upward inflections in the rate-of-aging curve. Individual
> variations in type of stress, hormonal response and diet, etc., probably
> govern the nature of the aging process in an individual.
>
> The amphetamine-like action of estrogen, which undoubtedly contributes to
> the general level of stress and excitotoxic abuse of nerve cells, is
> probably the only "useful" facet of estrogen treatment, but a little cocaine
> might achieve the same effect with no more harm, possibly less. The toxicity
> of catecholamines has been known for over thirty years, and estrogen's
> stimulating effects are partly the result of its conversion to catechol-
> estrogens which increase the activity of brain catecholamines. Estrogen's
> powerful ability to nullify learning seems never to be mentioned by the
> people who promote its use. The importance of a good balance of brain
> steroids for mood, attention, memory, and reasoning is starting to be
> recognized, but powerful economic forces militate against its general
> acceptance.
>
> Since the brain is the organ that can allow us to adapt without undergoing
> stress in the hormonal sense, it is very important to protect its
> flexibility and to keep its energy level high, so it can work in a relaxed
> way. It is the low energy cellular state that leads to the retention of
> calcium and iron, and to the production of age pigment, and other changes
> that constitute the vicious circle of aging. And mental activity that
> challenges obsession and rigidity might be the most important brain
> energizer. Pseudo-optimism, humor-as-therapy, has a certain value, but a
> deeper optimism involves a willingness to assimilate new information and to
> change plans accordingly.

> **SUPPLEMENTS**
>
> Nutritional supplements that might help to prevent or correct these brain
> syndromes include: Vitamin E and coconut oil; vitamin A; magnesium, sodium;
> thyroid which includes T3; large amounts of animal protein, especially eggs;
> sulfur, such as magnesium sulfate or flowers of sulfur, but not to take
> continuously, because of sulfur's interference with copper absorption;
> pregnenolone; progesterone if needed. Bright light, weak in the blue end of
> the spectrum and with protection against ultraviolet, activates respiratory
> metabolism and quenches free radicals. Raw carrot fiber and/or laxatives if
> needed; charcoal occasionally for gas or bowel irritation. Coconut oil
> serves several purposes. Its butyric acid is known to increase T3 uptake by
> glial cells. It has a general pro-thyroid action, for example by diluting
> and displacing antithyroid unsaturated oils, its short- and medium-chain
> fatty acids sustain blood sugar and have antiallergic actions, and it
> protects mitochondria against stressinjury.
>
> P.S.: In 1979, a woman whose husband was suffering from advanced Amyotrophic
> Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) asked me if I had any ideas for slowing his decline.
> I described my suspicion that ALS involved defective metabolism or
> regulation of testosterone. In some tissues, testosterone is selectively
> concentrated to prevent atrophy, and ALS is a disease of middle-age, when
> hormone regulation often becomes a special problem. In the late 1970s, there
> was discussion of a higher incidence of ALS in males, and especially in
> athletes. I told her about progesterone's general protective effects, its
> antagonism to testosterone, and its prevention of atrophy in various
> tissues. She decided to ask her doctor to try progesterone for her husband.
> Later, I learned that her husband had gone into a very rapid decline
> immediately after the injection, and died within a week; the physician had
> given him testosterone, since, he said, "testosterone and progesterone are
> both male hormones." Besides making me more aware of the problems patients
> have in communicating with physicians, this tended to reinforce my feeling
> that a hormone imbalance is involved in ALS. Although I haven't written much
> about testosterone's toxicity, Marian Diamond's work showed that prenatal
> testosterone is similar to prenatal estrogen, in causing decreased thickness
> of the cortex of the brain; both of those hormones oppose progesterone's
> brain-protecting and brain-promoting actions.

> GLOSSARY
>
> 1\. Amyloid is the old term for the "starchy" appearing (including the way
> it stains) proteins seen in various diseases, and in the brain in
> Alzheimer's disease.
>
> 2\. Cytochrome P450scc. The cytochromes are "pigments," in the same sense
> that they contain the colored "heme" group that gives hemoglobin its color.
> P450 means "protein that absorbs light at a wavelength of 450. The scc means
> "side-chain cleaving," which refers to the removal of the 6 carbon atoms
> that distinguish cholesterol from pregnenolone. Other Cyt P450 enzymes are
> important for their detoxifying oxidizing action, and some of these are
> involved in brain metabolism.
>
> 3\. Glial means "glue-like," and glial cells are mostly spidery-shaped cells
> that used to be thought of as just connective, supportive cells in the
> brain.
>
> 4\. Mitochondria (the "thread-like bodies") are the structures in cells
> which produce most of our metabolic energy by respiration, in response to
> the thyroid hormones.
>
> 5\. Mucoid--refers to a mucoprotein, a protein which contains some
> carbohydrate. A glycoprotein; usually not intended as a precise term.
>
> 6\. Myelination. Myelin is a multilayered enclosure of the axons (the long
> processes) of nerve cells, composed of proteins and complex lipids,
> including cholesterol. The layered material is a flat, thin extension of the
> cytoplasm of the oligodendroglial cells.
>
> 7\. Oligodendrocytes are one of the kinds of glial (or neuroglial) cells,
> and structurally they are unusual in having sheet-like, rather than just
> thread-like processes; they have a sensitivity ("receptors") to stress and
> valium, and produce pregnenolone when activated. Under the influence of
> thyroid hormone, they wrap themselves in thin layers around the conductive
> parts of nerve cells, leaving a multilayered "myelin" coating. Their
> absorption of thyroid hormone is promoted by butyrate, an anti-stress
> substance found in butter and coconut oil.
>
> 8\. Steroidogenesis is the creation of steroids, usually referring to the
> conversion of cholesterol to hormones.
