> **Hot flashes, energy, and aging**

> > Around the time that menstruation and fertility are ending, certain
> biological problems are more likely to occur. Between the ages of 50 and 55,
> about 60% of women experience repeated episodes of flushing and sweating.
> Asthma, migraine, epilepsy, arthritis, varicose veins, aneurysms, urticaria,
> reduced lung function, hypertension, strokes, and interstitial colitis are
> some of the other problems that often begin or get worse at the menopause,
> but that normally aren't considered to be causally related to it.

> > Recently, hot flashes are being taken more seriously, because of their
> association with increased inflammation, heart disease, and risk of
> dementia. Around the same age, late 40s to mid-50s, men begin to have a
> sudden increase of some of the same health problems, including night sweats,
> anxiety, and insomnia. In both sexes, the high incidence of depression in
> this age group has usually been explained "psychologically," rather than
> biologically.

> > When the estrogen industry began concentrating on women of menopausal age
> (after the disastrous years of selling it as a fertility drug), "estrogen
> replacement" therapy was promoted as a cure for the problems associated with
> menopause, including hot flashes, which were explained as the result of a
> deficiency of estrogen. However, in recent years, the phrase "estrogen
> deficiency" has begun to be replaced by the phrase "estrogen withdrawal,"
> because it has been found that women with hot flashes don't necessarily have
> less estrogen in their blood stream than women who don't have hot flashes.

> > Associated with this change of terminology, there has been a recognition
> that changes in the temperature regulating system in the brain, rather than
> changes in the amount of estrogen, are responsible for the hot flashes, but
> mainstream medicine has carefully avoided the investigation of this subject.
> The effects of estrogen on the thermoregulatory system are very clear, but
> the standard medical view is that the physiology of hot flashes simply isn't
> understood.

> > Since the medical literature boldly describes the mechanisms of the
> circulatory system and the causes of major problems such as heart attacks,
> high blood pressure, and strokes, it's odd that it doesn't have an
> explanation for "hot flashes."

> But looking at this historically, I think this selective ignorance is
> necessary, for the protection of some doctrines that have become very
> important for conventional medicine.

> > When doctors are talking about diseases of the heart and circulatory
> system, it's common for them to say that estrogen is protective, because it
> causes blood vessels to relax and dilate, improving circulation and
> preventing hypertension. The fact that estrogen increases the formation of
> nitric oxide, a vasodilator, is often mentioned as one of its beneficial
> effects. But in the case of hot flashes, dilation of the blood vessels is
> exactly the problem, and estrogen is commonly prescribed to prevent the
> episodic dilation of blood vessels that constitutes the hot flash. Nitric
> oxide increases in women in association with the menopause (Watanabe, et
> al., 2000), and it is increased by inflammation, and hot flushes are
> associated with various mediators of inflammation, but, as far as I can
> tell, no one has measured the production of nitric oxide during a hot flash.
> Inhibitors of nitric oxide formation reduce vasodilation during hot flushes
> (Hubing, et al., 2010).

> > Starting in the 1940s, the doctrine that menopause is the result of
> changes in the ovaries, involving a depletion of eggs and an associated loss
> of estrogen production, was widely taught to medical students. By the 1970s,
> the taboo against discussing menopause publicly was fading, and the mass
> media began teaching the public that hot flashes are the result of an
> estrogen deficiency, and that "estrogen replacement" is the most appropriate
> and effective treatment, and in the next 20 years almost half the women in
> the US began taking it around the time of menopause. This practice became
> routine at a time when "evidence based medicine" was being promoted as a new
> standard, but there was no evidence that women experiencing hot flashes were
> deficient in estrogen (in fact, there was evidence that they weren't), and
> there was evidence that hot flashes began when the first menstrual period
> was missed, which coincided with, and resulted from, a failure to produce a
> functional corpus luteum, preventing the production of a normal amount of
> progesterone. But the silly old doctrine of deficiency is often restated by
> professors, as if there was no doubt about it (for example, Rance, 2009;
> Bhattacharya and Keating, 2012).

> > This extremely persistent disregard for important evidence about the
> nature of menopause and its symptoms was guided by the estrogen industry,
> which began in the 1930s to call estrogen "the female hormone," disregarding
> the facts about the biological roles of estrogen and progesterone, because
> chemicals with estrogenic effects were numerous and cheap, while
> progesterone was expensive, and had no synthetic equivalents. At the time
> the pharmaceutical industry began promoting estrogen as the female hormone
> to prevent miscarriage, it was already well known that it could produce
> abortion, as well as causing inflammation and cancer, and some of the most
> famous estrogen researchers were warning of its multiple dangers in the
> 1930s.

> > Menopause is a major landmark of aging, and if its meaning is radically
> misunderstood, a coherent understanding of aging is unlikely, and without an
> understanding of the loss of functions with age, we won't really understand
> life. More specifically, the real causes of the many serious problems
> occurring in association with the menopause will be ignored. Finding the
> causes of the seemingly trivial hot flash will affect the way we understand
> aging and its diseases.

> > If a common occurrence is thought to have some importance in itself, or to
> relate closely to something of importance, it will be described carefully,
> and its general features will become part of the common understanding. It's
> clear that our medical culture hasn't considered the hot flash to be
> important, because there are still physicians who believe that the hot flash
> represents a rise of body temperature caused by a sudden increase of heat
> production, which they sometimes explain as an upward fluctuation of thyroid
> gland activity. Measurement of body temperature before and during hot
> flashes has shown clearly that the internal temperature is lowered slightly
> by the hot flash, as heat is lost from the skin, as a result of
> vasodilation. Physiologists have been studying the differences in
> temperature regulation between men and women, and the effects of hormones on
> temperature regulation, for more than 70 years, but the medical profession
> in the United States showed almost no interest in the subject for about 50
> years.

> > August Weismann's doctrine of "mortal soma, immortal germ line," led
> people to postulate that "primordial germ" cells migrated into the ovary
> (consisting of "somatic" cells) during embryonic development, and that the
> baby was born with a supply of germ cells that was used up during the
> reproductive lifetime, accounting for the decline of fertility with aging.
> The fact that menstrual cycles ended around the time that fertility ended
> was explained by the idea that ovulation caused the release of estrogen, and
> that the absence of eggs caused a failure to produce estrogen, and that the
> absence of estrogen led to the failure of the cyclical uterine changes. It
> was all deduced from a mistaken ideology about the nature of life.

> > Cancer of the endometrium (lining) of the uterus and breast cancer were
> known to be the first and second cancers, respectively, produced by
> uninterrupted exposure to estrogen (for example, Lipshutz, 1950).
> Investigation of the causes of endometrial cancer showed that women with
> anovulatory cycles, that failed to produce progesterone, or who had a
> reduced production of progesterone, developed overgrowth of the endometrium,
> and that these were the women who were later most likely to develop cancer
> of the endometrium. The peak incidence of endometrial cancer is in the
> postmenopausal years, resulting from prolonged exposure to estrogen,
> unopposed by progesterone. The medical belief* that "ovulation produces
> estrogen," and that the absence of menstruation means an absence of
> estrogen, has been very harmful to women's health.

> > Several laboratories, from the 1950s through the 1980s, investigated the
> causes of age-related infertility. A.L. Soderwall, among others,
> demonstrated that an excess of estrogen makes it impossible for the uterus
> to maintain a pregnancy.

> Subsequently, his lab showed that neither changes in the eggs nor changes in
> the uterus could explain age related infertility. Altered pituitary hormone
> cycles, resulting from changes in the brain, could account for the major
> changes in the ovaries and uterus.

> > Other experimenters, including P.M. Wise, V.M. Sopelak and R.L. Butcher
> (1982), P. Ascheim (1983), and D.C. Desjardins (1995) have clarified the
> interactions between the ovaries and the brain. For example, when the
> ovaries of an old animal are transplanted into a young animal, they are able
> to function in response to the new environment, but when the ovaries of a
> young animal are transplanted into an old animal, they fail to cycle.
> However, if the ovaries are removed from an animal when it's young, so that

> throughout its life, transplanted young ovaries will fail to cycle.

> > The work of Desjardins and others has demonstrated that free radicals
> generated by interactions of estrogen and iron with unsaturated fatty acids
> are responsible for damage to brain cells (Desjardins, et al., 1992). The
> damaged inhibitory nerve cells allow the pituitary to remain in a
> chronically active state; in old rats, this can produce a state of constant
> estrus. Several groups (Powers, et al., 2006; Everitt, et al., 1980;
> Telford, et al., 1986) have shown that removal of the pituitary gland can
> greatly extend lifespan, if thyroid hormone is supplemented.

> > One of the animal "models" used to study hot flashes is morphine
> withdrawal. The model seems relevant to human hot flashes, because estrogen
> can stop the morphine withdrawal flushing, and estrogen's acute and chronic
> effects on the brain-pituitary-ovary system involve the endorphins and the
> opioidergic nerves (Merchenthaler, et al., 1998; Holinka, et al., 2008).

> In young rats, sudden morphine withdrawal caused by injecting the anti-
> opiate naloxone, causes the tail skin to flush, with a temperature increase
> of a few degrees, and causes the core body temperature to fall slightly.
> However, old animals respond to the withdrawal in two different ways. One
> group responded to the naloxone with an exaggerated flushing and decrease of
> core temperature. The other group of old rats, which already had a lower
> body temperature, didn't flush at all (Simpkins, 1994). I think this
> provides an insight into the reason that menopausal treatment with estrogen
> can relieve some hot flashes--estrogen treatment might create a flush
> resistant state similar to that of the cooler old animals in Simpkins'
> experiment.

> It has been known for a long time, from studies in animals and people, that
> estrogen lowers body temperature, and that this involves a tendency to
> increase blood flow to the skin in response to a given environmental
> temperature, that is, the temperature "set-point" is lowered by estrogen.
> Besides increasing heat loss, estrogen decreases heat production. These
> physiological effects of estrogen can be seen in the normal menstrual cycle,
> with progesterone having the opposite effect of estrogen on metabolic rate,
> skin circulation, body temperature, and heat loss. This causes the familiar
> rise in temperature when ovulation occurs. Occasionally, young women will
> experience hot flashes during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle
> because of insufficient progesterone production, or at menstruation, when
> the corpus luteus stops producing progesterone.

> > Estrogen increases the free fatty acids circulating in the blood, and this
> shifts metabolism away from oxidation of glucose to oxidation of fat, and it
> also reduces oxidative metabolism, for example by lowering thyroid function
> (Vandorpe and Kühn, 1989). These changes are analogous to those of fasting,
> in which metabolism shifts to the oxidation of fatty acids for energy,
> causes decreased body temperature, and in some animals leads to a state of
> torpor or hibernation.

> > Despite decreasing oxidative metabolism, estrogen stimulates the adrenal
> cortex, both directly and indirectly through the brain and pituitary,
> increasing the production of cortisol. Cortisol, by increasing protein
> turnover, can increase heat production, but this effect isn't necessarily
> sufficient to maintain a normal body temperature. It increases blood
> glucose, mainly by blocking its use for energy production, but the glucose
> is derived from the breakdown of muscle protein. It allows some glucose to

> Simpkin's cooler old rats, which failed to flush during morphine withdrawal.
> Menopausal estrogen treatment is known to lower temperature (Brooks, et al.,
> 1994).

> > Since the Women's Health Initiative publicized the dangers of estrogen,
> there has been some interest in alternative treatments for hot flashes.
> Since a reduced production of progesterone has been associated with hot
> flushes for several decades, it isn't surprising that it is now being tested
> as an alternative to estrogen. Recently, 300 mg of oral progesterone was
> found to be effective for decreasing hot flashes, and a month after
> discontinuing it, the hot flushes were still less frequent than before using
> it (Prior and Hitchcock, 2012). Previously, transdermal progesterone was
> found to be effective (Leonetti, et al., 1999).

> > One of the things progesterone does is to stabilize blood sugar. In one
> experiment, hot flashes were found to be increased by lowering blood sugar,
> and decreased by moderately increasing blood sugar (Dormire and Reame,
> 2003).

> Hypoglycemia increases the brain hormone, corticotropin release hormone, CRH
> (Widmaier, et al., 1988), which increases ACTH and cortisol. CRH causes

> With advancing age, most tissues become less sensitive to adrenaline and the

> occurring around the menopause, such as the rise of free fatty acids and
> decrease of glucose availability, increase the sensitivity of the CRH
> nerves, causing the fluctuations of the adrenergic system to cause larger
> increases of ACTH and cortisol. Estrogen is another factor that increases
> the sensitivity of the CRH nerves, and unsaturated fatty acids (Widmaier, et
> al. 1995) and serotonin (Buckingham, et al., 1982) are other factors
> stimulating it. Serotonin, like noradrenalin, rises with hypoglycemia
> (Vahabzadeh, et al., 1995), and estrogen contributes to hypoglycemia, by
