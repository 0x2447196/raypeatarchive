> When energy fails: Edema, heart failure, hypertension, sarcopenia, etc.**

> > More than 100 years ago the idea of a morphogenetic field was proposed by
> A.G. Gurwitsch, as a way to explain the orderly movements of cells in
> embryos and growing tissues, and to understand the principles that cause
> cells to change appropriately when their location in the organism changes.
> For 30 years, the concept guided research in embryology, but also led to
> important discoveries in the biology of cancer, aging, wound repair, and
> other important areas. But by the late 1940s, a more abstract approach to
> biology, based on the gene doctrine of Mendel and Weismann, took charge of
> academic and governmental biological research. This ideology at first said
> that organisms are determined by unchanging units of inheritance, "genes,"
> and later when genes were found to be susceptible to mutation, the changes
> were said to be always random. The Central Dogma of the ideology was that
> any meaningful, adaptive changes that occur in an organism can't influence
> the genes. For many years, adaptive changes were said to be nothing but
> changes in the size or function of existing cells, because the cells of the
> major organs of the body were supposed to be created before birth, or in
> infancy.

> > Besides the purely ideological commitment to the theory of genes, there
> were other influences that contributed to the culture of Molecular Biology.
> People learned histology from slides or pictures made by killing, hardening,
> dehydrating, and slicing parts of organisms. Biochemists studied the
> chemistry of life mainly by grinding cells or tissues, and extracting water
> soluble materials to study the actions of enzymes on various materials.
> These unrealistic artifacts filled the textbooks and the minds of
> generations of biologists and physicians. The culture of molecular biology
> used these artifacts to create theories of embryology and physiology, and
> holistic ideas such as the developmental field were disregarded.

> > The mental image of a living organism that has been created by that
> culture is simply wrong. The concept of a developmental field is essential
> for understanding embryology, because things that exist on a scale bigger
> than molecules and cells govern the functions of the molecules and cells,
> and the principles of embryology don't arbitrarily stop operating at birth,
> but can be seen to continue operating during maturity and aging. The
> interactions of cells with their environment are different at different
> stages of life, but there are commonalities that are extremely important.

> > The processes that govern the pregnant woman's blood circulation, in
> sustaining the development of a fetus, are very similar to the processes
> that govern anyone's blood circulation, providing for the maintenance and
> renewal of all the body's organs. The common problems of pregnancy involving
> the circulatory system can provide insights into the problems of the various
> organs that have been the focus of the medical specialties, and to some
> basic medical issues, including aging, obesity, and inflammation.

> > The development of a fertilized egg into an embryo consumes energy at a
> very high rate, and the way the embryo develops depends on a continuously
> adequate supply of oxygen and sugar, and other nutrients. The intense flow
> of energy through each stage of a developing structure shapes the following
> stage. The necessary energy and materials are provided abundantly by the
> mother's blood. When the development has advanced far enough to make life
> possible outside the uterus, energy will be used more slowly, for growth,
> maintenance, and renewal of tissues.

> > Failure to renew cells and tissues leads to the loss of function and
> substance. Bones and muscles get weaker and smaller with aging. Diminished
> bone substance, osteopenia, is paralleled, at roughly the same rate, by the
> progressive loss of muscle mass, sarcopenia (or myopenia). The structure of
> aging tissue changes, with collagen tending to fill the spaces left by the
> disappearing cells. It's also common for fat cells to increase, as muscle
> cells disappear.

> > When conditions are ideal, as during healthy development in the uterus,
> tissue damage is corrected by the multiplication of cells to replace any
> that were lost. But when conditions are less perfect, injuries are
> imperfectly repaired, usually with highly collagenous scar tissue bridging
> the area that was destroyed. During this imperfect repair, there is
> inflammation, which apparently exists to the extent that the substances
> needed for regeneration are lacking. For example, when oxygen is lacking,
> lactic acid is likely to be produced, along with increases of pro-
> inflammatory regulators such as histamine and serotonin, leading to the loss
> of many important proteins and functions, and the over-production of
> collagen instead.

> > Since cellular renewal of tissues, in a healthy individual, is a constant
> process, we can think of the metabolic rate of a healthy adult as just what
> is needed to sustain this constant, limited sort of regeneration, but not
> quite intense enough to produce scarless healing of a wound (without special
> intervention).

> > If something reduces the systemic ability to produce energy, there will be
> a gap between the available energy and the energy needed for the constant
> turnover of cells in each tissue and organ, and a generalized inflammation
> will develop. The replacement of cells will be slowed, and the organism will
> mobilize the processes used for producing scar tissue, producing an excess
> of collagen, filling the spaces left by the lost cells.

> > We are susceptible to many things that interfere with energy production---
> the substitution of iron for copper in the respiratory enzyme, the
> absorption of endotoxin, the accumulation of PUFA, a deficiency of thyroid
> hormone, the formation of increased amounts of nitric oxide, serotonin, and
> histamine, etc. Different environments will condition the way the defensive
> mechanisms of inflammation are produced.

> > Toxemia of pregnancy, or preeclampsia, is a state of generalized
> inflammation, and some of the causes and remedies are known. Despite the
> predominance of crazy genetic theories of preeclampsia in 20th century
> medical literature, there was clear evidence (reviewed by Tom Brewer,
> Douglas Shanklin, and Jay Hodin) that it was caused by malnutrition, and
> that it could be cured by adequate protein, salt, and calcium.

> > The old medical practice of restricting salt intake during pregnancy was
> an important factor in causing it, so it's interesting to look at the
> effects of salt restriction as a treatment for hypertension.

> > The pregnant woman's blood volume expands, to permit the supply of energy
> to match the needs of the embryo. If the blood volume doesn't increase, or
> if it decreases, as in pregnancy toxemia, her blood pressure will increase.
> Typically, the decrease of blood volume is accompanied by an increase in the
> extracellular fluid, edema, resulting from leakage of fluid through the
> walls of the capillaries, and albumin appears in the urine as it leaks
> through the capillaries in the kidneys. The amount of blood pumped by the
> heart, however, is increased in toxemia (Hamilton, 1952), showing that the
> increased blood pressure is at least partially compensating for the smaller
> volume of blood.

> > A similar situation, **reduced blood volume and edema, can be seen
> (Tarazi, 1976) in "essential hypertension," the "unexplained" hi** gh blood
> pressure that occurs more often with increasing age and obesity. At the
> beginning of "essential hypertension," the amount of blood pumped is usually
> greater than normal.

> > In both situations, preeclampsia and essential hypertension, there is an
> increased amount of aldosterone, an adrenal steroid which allows the kidneys
> to retain sodium, and to lose potassium and ammonium instead. A restriction
> of salt in the diet causes more aldosterone to be produced, and increased
> salt in the diet causes aldosterone to decrease. One effect of aldosterone
> is to increase the production of a substance called vascular endothelial
> growth factor, VEGF, or vascular permeability factor, which causes
> capillaries to become leaky, and causes new blood vessels to grow.

> > While **increased salt in the diet tends to lower both aldosterone and
> VEGF, reducing the leakiness of blood vessels,** sodium also has a direct
> effect that tends to prevent the leakage of water and albumin out of the
> blood vessels, helping to maintain the blood volume which is needed to
> perfuse the kidneys, preventing them from producing signals to increase
> blood pressure and aldosterone. There is a large amount of albumin in the
> blood serum, and sodium ions associate with the negative electrical charges
> on the albumin molecule. This association causes the complex of albumin and
> sodium to attract a large amount of water, that is to exert osmotic or
> oncotic pressure. This oncotic pressure causes any excess extracellular
> water to be attracted into the blood vessels, preventing edema while
> maintaining the blood volume. When there is too little sodium, the albumin
> molecule itself easily leaves the blood stream along with the water.

> > Instead of considering the significance of sodium's effects on albumin,
> aldosterone, and VEGF, textbooks have often talked about the factors that
> "pump" sodium, and factors that specifically regulate the movement of water.
> Experiments in which an excess of aldosterone is combined with a high salt
> intake produce increased blood pressure, and--by invoking various genes--
> salt is said to cause hypertension in certain people. This reasoning is
> hardly different from the reasoning of the drug companies in the 1950s who
> said that since women with toxemia have hypertension and edema, they should
> be treated with a diuretic and a low salt diet, to eliminate water and to
> reduce blood pressure.

> > The physiological loss of sodium occurs when energy metabolism fails, as
> in **diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperestrogenism, and starvation.** What
> these conditions have in common is an increased level of free fatty acids in
> the blood. Increased free fatty acids impair the use of glucose. The
> consumption of carbohydrate, like an increase of thyroid hormone, insulin,
> or progesterone, increases the retention of sodium; fructose is the most
> effective carbohydrate (Rebello, et al., 1983).

> > The loss of sodium is often accompanied by the retention of water,
> reducing the osmotic pressure of the body fluids. The leakiness of blood
> vessels allows the extracellular fluid volume to increase, as understood in
> the standard definition of edema. However, when this fluid is hypo-osmotic,
> it will enter cells, causing them to swell. Cell swelling excites cells
> (Ayus, et al., 2008; Baxter, et al., 1991), and can kill them if they are
> unable to produce enough energy to restore their original volume, by
> measures including the excretion of amino acids and potassium. Both low
> sodium (hyponatremia) and low osmotic pressure stimulate the adrenergic
> nervous system.

> > The increase of adrenalin,f caused by a deficiency of sodium, is one of
> the factors that can increase blood pressure; if the tissues's glycogen
> stores are depleted, the adrenalin will mobilize free fatty acids from the
> tissues, which tends to inhibit energy production from glucose, and to
> increase leakiness. After I had read Tom Brewer's work on preventing or
> curing preeclampsia with added salt, I realized that the premenstrual
> syndrome involved some of the features of preeclampsia (edema, insomnia,
> cramps, hypertension, salt craving), so I suggested to a friend that she
> might try salting her food to taste, instead of trying to restrict salt to
> "prevent edema." She immediately noticed that it prevented her monthly edema
> problem. For several years, all the women who tried it had similarly good
> results, and often mentioned that their sleep improved. I mentioned this to
> several people with sleep problems, and regardless of age, their sleep
> improved when they ate as much salt as they wanted. Around that time,
> several studies had shown that salt restriction increases adrenalin, and one
> study showed that most old people on a low sodium diet suffered from
> insomnia, and had unusually high adrenalin. When they ate a normal amount of
> salt, their adrenalin was normalized, and they slept better.

> > It's very common for physicians who are aware of progesterone's "anti-
> aldosterone" activity to think that both estrogen and progesterone are
> responsible for the increased risk of sodium loss in women, especially
> during pregnancy, but Hans Selye demonstrated that progesterone will
> normalize sodium retention even when there is no aldosterone at all,
> following removal of the adrenal glands. It is estrogen which is responsible
> for the dangerous loss of sodium.

> > The ratio of estrogen to progesterone--regardless of age or gender--is an
> important factor in regulating minerals and water, cell energy metabolism,
> and blood pressure. The ratios of many other regulatory substances
> (including serotonin/dopamine, glucagon/insulin, and
> aldosterone/cortisol+progesterone) vary according to the quality of the
> individual's level of adaptation to the environment. Improving the
> environment can shift the ratio in the direction of restoration, rather than
> mere survival.

> > Gershom Zajicek and his colleagues have demonstrated an organized renewal
> of tissues, in which new cells are born with the division of stem cells, and
> "stream" away from their origin as they mature, and finally are shed or
> dissolved. A few studies have demonstrated a similar kind of migration of
> new cells in the brain (Eriksson, et al., 1998; Gould, et al., 1999), a
> process which differs by the absence of systematic dissolution of mature
> brain cells. While Zajicek has demonstrated the conversion of one kind of
> cell, such as a pancreatic ductal epithelial or acinar cell into insulin-
> secreting beta cells, other researchers have shown that after injury to the
> pancreas beta cells can be formed from glucagon-secreting alpha cells, as
> well as from other beta cells.

> > Stress, increasing the need for energy, increases the formation of
> cortisol and free fatty acids when glucose isn't available, and those--while

> medical culture still claims that "sugar causes diabetes."

> > In the adrenal glands, renewing cells stream from the capsule on the
> surface of the gland toward the center of the gland. The first cells to be
> produced in a regenerating gland are those that produce aldosterone, the
> next in the stream are the cortisol producing cells, and the last to be
> formed are the cells that produce the sex hormones, the androgens including
> DHEA, and progesterone. In aging, after the age of thirty, the renewal
> slows, but the dissolution of the sex hormone zone continues, so the
> proportion shifts, increasing the ratio of the aldosterone and cortisol
> producing cells to the layer that produces the protective androgens and
> progesterone (Parker, et al., 1997).

> > Even before aldosterone was identified, progesterone's role in regulating

> to progesterone is recognized.

> > While stress typically causes the adrenal glands to produce cortisol,

> influence the production of the adrenal steroids, arachidonic acid, even
> without being converted to prostaglandins, is an important activator of

> liberates free fatty acids from the tissues, so when the tissues contain
> large amounts of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, the production of
> aldosterone will be greater than it would be otherwise.

> > The continuing accumulation of polyunsaturated fats in the tissues is
> undoubtedly important in the changing relationship between the pancreas and
> the adrenal glands in aging. Aspirin, which is antilipolytic, decreasing the
> release of free fatty acids, as well as inhibiting their conversion to
> prostaglandins, lowers the production of stress-induced aldosterone, and
> helps to lower blood pressure, if it's taken in the evening, to prevent the
> increase of free fatty acids during the night. Aspirin increases insulin
> sensitivity. A low salt diet increases the free fatty acids, leading to
> insulin resistance, increasing free fatty acids in the blood, and
> contributing to atherosclerosis (Prada, et al., 2000; Mrnka, et al., 2000;
> Catanozi, et al., 2003; Garg, et al., 2011).

> > The same factors that support or interfere with cellular renewal in the
