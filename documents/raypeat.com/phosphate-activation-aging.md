> ## **Phosphate, activation, and aging**

> > Recent publications are showing that excess phosphate can increase
> inflammation, tissue atrophy, calcification of blood vessels, cancer,
> dementia, and, in general, the processes of aging. This is especially
> important, because of the increasing use of phosphates as food additives.

> > Previously, the complications of chronic kidney disease, with increased
> serum phosphate, were considered to be specific for that condition, but the
> discovery of a phosphate-regulating gene named klotho (after one of the
> Fates in Greek mythology) has caused a lot of rethinking of the biological
> role of phosphate. In the 19th century, phosphorus was commonly called brain
> food, and since about 1970, its involvement in cell regulation has become a
> focus of reductionist thinking. ATP, adenosine triphosphate, is seen as the
> energy source that drives cell movement as well as the "pumps" that maintain
> the living state, and as the source of the cyclic AMP that is a general
> activator of cells, and as the donor of the phosphate group that activates a
> great number of proteins in the "phosphorylation cascade." When tissues
> calcified in the process of aging, calcium was blamed (ignoring the
> existence of calcium phosphate crystals in the tissues), and low calcium
> diets were recommended. Recently, when calcium supplements haven't produced
> the intended effects, calcium was blamed, disregarding the other materials
> present in the supplements, such as citrate, phosphate, orotate, aspartate,
> and lactate.

> > I have a different perspective on the "phosphorylation cascade," and on
> the other functions of phosphate in cells, based largely on my view of the
> role of water in cell physiology. In the popular view, a stimulus causes a
> change of shape in a receptor protein, causing it to become an active
> enzyme, catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to another
> protein, causing it to change shape and become activated, and to transfer
> phosphate groups to other molecules, or to remove phosphates from active
> enzymes, in chain reactions. This is standard biochemistry, that can be done
> in a test tube.

> Starting around 1970, when the involvement of phosphorylation in the
> activation of enzymes in glycogen breakdown was already well known, people
> began noticing that the glycogen phosphorylase enzyme became active
> immediately when the muscle cell contracted, and that phosphorylation
> followed the activation. Phosphorylation was involved in activation of the
> enzyme, but if something else first activated the enzyme (by changing its
> shape), the addition of the phosphate group couldn't be considered as
> causal, in the usual reductionist sense. It was one participant in a complex
> causal process. I saw this as a possible example of the effect of changing
> water structure on protein structure and function. This view of water
> questions the relevance of test tube biochemistry.

> > Enzymes are known which suddenly become inactive when the temperature is
> lowered beyond a certain point. This is because soluble proteins arrange
> their shape so that their hydrophobic regions, the parts with fat-like side-
> chains on the amino acids, are inside, with the parts of the chain with
> water-soluble amino acids arranged to be on the outside, in contact with the
> water. The "wetness" of water, its activity that tends to exclude the oily
> parts of the protein molecule, decreases as the temperature decreases, and
> some proteins are destabilized when the relatively hydrophobic group is no
> longer repelled by the surrounding cooler water.

> > In the living cell, the water is all within a very short distance of a
> surface of fats or fat-like proteins. In a series of experiments, starting
> in the 1960s, Walter Drost-Hansen showed that, regardless of the nature of
> the material, the water near a surface is structurally modified, becoming
> less dense, more voluminous. This water is more "lipophilic," adapting
> itself to the presence of fatty material, as if it were colder. This change
> in the water's properties also affects the solubility of ions, increasing
> the solubility of potassium, decreasing that of sodium, magnesium, and
> calcium (Wiggins, 1973).

> > When a muscle contracts, its volume momentarily decreases (Abbott and
> Baskin, 1962). Under extremely high pressure, muscles contract. In both
> situations, the work-producing process of contraction is associated with a
> slight reduction in volume. During contraction of a muscle or nerve, heat is
> given off, causing the temperature to rise. During relaxation, recovering
> from excitation, heat is absorbed (Curtin and Woledge, 1974; Westphal, et
> al., 1999; Constable, et al. 1997). In the case of a nerve, following the
> heating produced by excitation, the temperature of the nerve decreases below
> the starting temperature (Abbot, et al., 1965). Stretching a muscle causes
> energy to be absorbed (Constable, et al., 1997). Energy changes such as
> these, without associated chemical changes, have led some investigators to
> conclude that muscle tension generation is "entropy driven" (Davis and
> Rodgers, 1995).

> > Kelvin's description (1858) of the physics of water in a soap bubble, "â€¦if
> a film such as a soap-bubble be enlarged . . . it experiences a cooling
> effect . . . ," describes the behavior of nerves and muscles, absorbing
> energy or heat when they are relaxing (or elongating), releasing it when
> they are excited/contracting.

> > Several groups of experimenters over the last 60 years have tried to
> discover what happens to the missing heat; some have suggested electrical or
> osmotic storage, and some have demonstrated that stretching generates ATP,
> arguing for chemical storage. Physical storage in the form of structural
> changes in the water-protein-lipid system, interacting with chemical changes
> such as ATP synthesis, have hardly been investigated.

> Early studies of muscle chemistry and contraction found that adding ATP to a
> viscous solution of proteins extracted from muscle reduced its viscosity,
> and also that the loss of ATP from muscle caused its hardening, as in rigor
> mortis; if the pH wasn't too acidic, the dead muscle would contract as the
> ATP content decreased. Szent-Gyorgyi found that a muscle hardened by rigor
> mortis became soft again when ATP was added.

> > Rigor mortis is an extreme state of fatigue, or energy depletion. Early
> muscle studies described the phenomenon of "fatigue contracture," in which
> the muscle, when it reaches the point at which it stops responding to
> stimulation, is maximally contracted (this has also been called delayed
> relaxation). Ischemic contracture, in the absence of blood circulation,
> occurs when the muscle's glycogen is depleted, so that ATP can no longer be
> produced anaerobically (Kingsley, et al., 1991). The delayed relaxation of
> hypothyroid muscle is another situation in which it is clear that ATP is
> required for relaxation. (In the Achilles tendon reflex test, the relaxation
> rate is visibly slowed in hypothyroidism.) A delayed T wave in the
> electrocardiogram, and the diastolic contracture of the failing heart show
> the same process of delayed relaxation. Supplementing the active thyroid
> hormone, T3, can quickly restore the normal rate of relaxation, and its
> beneficial effects have been demonstrated in heart failure (Pingitore, et
> al., 2008; Wang, et al., 2006; Pantos, et al., 2007; Galli, et al., 2008).

> > A large part of the magnesium in cells is bound to ATP, and the magnesium-
> ATP complex is a factor in muscle relaxation. A deficiency of either ATP or
> magnesium contributes to muscle cramping. When a cell is stimulated, causing
> ATP to release inorganic phosphate, it also releases magnesium. Above the pH
> of 6.7, phosphate is doubly ionized, in which state it has the same kind of
> structural effect on water that magnesium, calcium, and sodium have, causing
> water molecules to be powerfully attracted to the concentrated electrical
> charge of the ion. Increasing the free phosphate and magnesium opposes the
> effect of the surfaces of fats and proteins on the water structure, and
> tends to decrease the solubility of potassium in the water, and to increase
> the water's "lipophobic" tendency to minimize its contacts with fats and the
> fat-like surface of proteins, causing the proteins to rearrange themselves.

> > These observations relating to the interactions of water, solutes and
> proteins in muscles and nerves provide a coherent context for understanding
> contraction and conduction, which is lacking in the familiar descriptions
> based on membranes, pumps, and cross-bridges, but I think they also provide
> a uniquely useful context for understanding the possible dangers of an
> excess of free phosphate in the body.

> > A few people (M. Thomson, J. Gunawardena, A.K. Manrai) are showing that
> principles of mass-action help to simplify understanding the networks of
> phosphorylation and dephosphorylation that are involved in cell control. But
> independently from the phosphorylation of proteins, the presence of
> phosphate ion in cell water modifies the cell's ion selectivity, shifting
> the balance toward increased uptake of sodium and calcium, decreasing
> potassium, tending to depolarize and "activate" the cell.

> > About 99% of the publications discussing the mechanism of muscle
> contraction fail to mention the presence of water, and there's a similar
> neglect of water in discussions of the energy producing processes in the
> mitochondrion. The failure of mitochondrial energy production leads to lipid
> peroxidation, activation of inflammatory processes, and can cause
> disintegration of the energy producing structure. Increased phosphate
> decreases mitochondrial energy production (Duan and Karmazyn, 1989), causes
> lipid peroxidation (Kowaltowski, et al., 1996), and activates inflammation,
> increasing the processes of tissue atrophy, fibrosis, and cancer.

> > For about twenty years it has been clear that the metabolic problems that
> cause calcium to be lost from bones cause calcium to increase in the soft
> tissues, such as blood vessels. The role of phosphate in forming calcium
> phosphate crystals had until recently been assumed to be passive, but some
> specific "mechanistic" effects have been identified. For example, increased
> phosphate increases the inflammatory cytokine, osteopontin (Fatherazi, et
> al., 2009), which in bone is known to activate the process of
> decalcification, and in arteries is involved in calcification processes
> (Tousoulis, et al., 2012). In the kidneys, phosphate promotes calcification
> (Bois and Selye, 1956), and osteopontin, by its activation of inflammatory
> T-cells, is involved in the development of glomerulonephritis, as well as in
> inflammatory skin reactions (Yu, et al., 1998). High dietary phosphate
> increases serum osteopontin, as well as serum phosphate and parathyroid
> hormone, and increases the formation of tumors in skin (Camalier, et al.,
> 2010). Besides the activation of cells and cell systems, phosphate (like
> other ions with a high ratio of charge to size, including citrate) can
> activate viruses (Yamanaka, et al., 1995; Gouvea, et al., 2006). Aromatase,
> the enzyme that synthesizes estrogen, is an enzyme that's sensitive to the
> concentration of phosphate (Bellino and Holben, 1989).

> > More generally, increased dietary phosphate increases the activity of an
> important regulatory enzyme, protein kinase B, which promotes organ growth.
> A high phosphate diet increases the growth of liver (Xu, et al., 2008) and
> lung (Jin, et al., 2007), and promotes the growth of lung cancer (Jin, et
> al., 2009). An extreme reduction of phosphate in the diet wouldn't be
> appropriate, however, because a phosphate deficiency stimulates cells to
> increase the phosphate transporter, increasing the cellular uptake of
> phosphate, with an effect similar to the dietary excess of phosphate, i.e.,
> promotion of lung cancer (Xu, et al., 2010). The optimum dietary amount of
> phosphate, and its balance with other minerals, hasn't been determined.

> > While increased phosphate slows mitochondrial energy production,
> decreasing its intracellular concentration increases the respiratory rate
> and the efficiency of ATP formation. A "deficiency" of polyunsaturated fatty
> acids has this effect (Nogueira, et al., 2001), but so does the consumption
> of fructose (Green, et al., 1993; Lu, et al., 1994).

> In a 1938 experiment (Brown, et al.) that intended to show the essentiality
> of unsaturated fats, a man, William Brown, lived for six months on a 2500
> calorie diet consisting of sucrose syrup, a gallon of milk (some of it in

> disappearance of the normal fatigue after a day's work, as well as the
> normalization of his high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and the
> permanent disappearance of his frequent life-long migraine headaches. His

> during the experimental diet, his fasting plasma inorganic phosphorus was
> 3.43 and 2.64 mg. per 100 ml. of plasma, and six month after he had returned
> to a normal diet the number was 4.2 mg/100 ml. Both the deficiency of the

> > In 2000, researchers who were convinced that fructose is harmful to the

> presumably weren't growing very much. To steadily accumulate both calcium
> and magnesium, with the calcium retention much larger than the magnesium,
> the minerals were probably mostly being incorporated into their bones. Their

> > Another important effect of carbon dioxide is in the regulation of both
> calcium and phosphate, by increasing the absorption and retention of calcium
> (Canzanello, et al., 1995), and by increasing the excretion of phosphate.
> Increased carbon dioxide (as dissolved gas) and bicarbonate (as sodium
> bicarbonate) both increase the excretion of phosphate in the urine, even in

> > This calcium solubilizing effect of bicarbonate, combined with its

> prevention of vascular calcification by the thyroid hormones (Sato, et al.,
> 2005, Tatar, 2009, Kim, et al., 2012). Distensibility of the blood vessels
> and heart, increased by carbon dioxide, is decreased in hypothyroidism,
> heart failure, and by phosphate.

> > While fructose lowers intracellular phosphate, it also lowers the amount

> > Niacinamide is another nutrient that lowers serum phosphate (Cheng, et

> al., 2000; Kuro-o, et al., 1997; Osuka and Razzaque, 2012). The foods
