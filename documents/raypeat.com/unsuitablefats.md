Suitable Fats, Unsuitable Fats: Issues in Nutrition**  
  

For fifty years, the mass media have been making the public think about the
fats in their diet, filling the culture with clichés about bad saturated
animal fats that raise cholesterol, or lately the trans-fats in margarine, and
images of arteries clogged by bad fats. The public instruction about the fats
we should eat resembles the owner's manual for a car, that tells you what kind
of motor oil and fuel and coolant to use; they are telling us that they know
how our body works, and that they know what it needs. But now, even after the
human genome has supposedly been partly "decoded," the biological functions of
the fats have hardly begun to be investigated.

To understand the present issues regarding fats in nutrition and medicine it's
helpful to look at the historical development of biochemical and physiological
fat research in a variety of contexts, including agriculture and economics, as
well as considering the effects of the changing ideas about cell structure,
vitamins, hormones, immunology, brain development, evolution, and the growing
understanding of the way physiology interacts with ecology. We need to
recognize the complexity of the physiology of fats, to appreciate the
complexity of the living organism.

Financial considerations have driven fat research in very obvious ways. In
1883, Mark Twain described how commercial fraud was making use of new
technology to substitute cheap fats and oils for butter and olive oil.. Hard
fats such as tallow, which had been used for making soap and candles, began to
be widely used as a substitute for butter in the 19th century. Around 1912,
chemists found economical ways to solidify (for use as a butter substitute)
the very cheap liquid oils, such as cottonseed oil, linseed oil, whale oil,
and fish oils, which been used mostly as fuels or varnish. The seed oils were
so cheap that meat packers quickly became major producers of hydrogenated
cottonseed and soy oils, to extend their limited supply of lard or tallow for
sale as shortening or margarine.

Between 1912 and 1927 there were several studies that reported that animals
could live on a fat-free diet, and that in fact they lived longer, and without
the normal mortality from cancer. In the 1940s and 1950s, most textbooks that
mentioned the idea that certain fats were essential nutrients described it as
a controversial idea. But the oil industries used public relations effectively
to sell the medical (heart protective) benefits of a diet containing increased
amounts of linoleic and linolenic acids, which they called the essential fatty
acids. They began citing a 1929 publication (by G. Burr and M. Burr) that
claimed to demonstrate the essentiality of those fatty acids, while ignoring
the publications that pointed in different directions.

The cheapness of the seed oils led to their use in animal feeds, to promote
growth. By the 1940s, the polyunsaturated oils, including fish oils, were
known to cause deterioration of the brain, muscles, and gonads in a variety of
animals, and this was found to be caused mainly by their destruction of
vitamin E. A little later, the disease called steatitis or yellow fat disease
was found to be produced in various animals that were fed too much fish or
fish oil.

The reason linseed oil and fish oil were used for making varnishes and paints
was that they are "drying oils," reacting with oxygen to polymerize and
harden. The physical and chemical propertiess of the oils are fairly well
understood, and among the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) the omega -3
fatty acids react most easily with oxygen. Heat, light, and moisture increase
their spontaneous interactions with oxygen, and besides polymerizing, these
oils produce a variety of reactive particles, including acrolein, which
combine with other substances, such as cellular proteins and DNA, with highly
toxic effects. At low temperatures and low oxygen concentrations these oils
are not highly reactive. Fats that harden at low temperatures (as saturated
fats do) wouldn't be convenient for organisms that live in a cool environment,
and so organisms regulate the type of fat they synthesize according to the
temperature of their tissues. The fact that certain types of polyunsaturated
fatty acids function nicely in fish, worms, and insects, doesn't mean that
they are ideal fats for mammals.

The fact that vitamin E prevented or cured some of the major diseases in farm
animals caused by excessive PUFA, and that it could retard the development of
rancidity in stored oils, led quickly to the persistent belief that lipid
peroxidation is the only toxic effect of the vegetable oils. However, the oils
were being seen to cause other problems, including accelerated aging and
obesity, but those problems weren't of interest to farmers, who wanted to sell
plump young animals as cheaply and quickly as possible. Even fresh oils have
toxic effects, and the oxidative damage they do is often the consequence of
these other toxic actions.

Another cheap food additive, coconut oil, was found to increase feed
consumption while slowing weight gain, so it wasn't popular in the meat
industry. The highly unsaturated seed oils had the opposite effect, of
producing a rapid fattening of the animal, while decreasing feed consumption,
so by 1950 corn and soybeans were widely considered to be optimal feeds for
maximizing profits in the production of meat animals. It was at this time that
the industry found that it could market the liquid oils directly to consumers,
as health-promoting foods, without bothering to turn them into solid
shortening or margarine. Somehow, few physiologists continued to think about
the implications of metabolic slowing, obesity, and the related degenerative
diseases.

As vitamin research advanced in the 1940s, Roger Williams' lab at the Clayton
Foundation Biochemical Institute, University of Texas at Austin, recognized
the "fat deficiency disease" of the Burrs as a deficiency of vitamin B6, and
showed that when they produced the condition with a diet similar to the one
the Burrs had used, they could cure it by administering vitamin B6. In the
early 1930s George Burr had discovered that animals on a fat free diet had an
extremely high rate of metabolism, but he didn't investigate the important
ramifications of that observation, such as their increased need for vitamins
and minerals, in accordance with their rate of metabolism. The PUFA slowed
metabolism, and that effect was good for agriculture.

The commercial pressure on fat research has created a new way of writing
research reports, that several decades earlier wouldn't have been acceptable.
For example, the effects of a specific fat on a few of the components of a
complex process such as clotting are often described in the title,
introduction, and conclusion of an article as if they were revealing a way to
prevent heart disease. The effects of unsaturated fats on cells _in vitro_ are
often the opposite of their effects in living animals, but editors are
allowing authors to claim that their _in vitro_ results justify dietary or
therapeutic use of the fats. Journals of medicine and nutrition are now
preferred sites for commercial press releases, composed to superficially
resemble scientific reports.

The suppressive effects of unsaturated fats on mitochondrial energy production
have been widely investigated, since it is that effect that makes animal
fattening with PUFA so economical. Rather than interpreting that as a toxic
effect, using the innate structure and function of the mitochondrion as a
point of reference from which to evaluate dietary components, the consumption
of "good" oils is being used as the reference point from which to evaluate the
meaning of metabolism ("efficiency is good," "low oxygen consumption is
good"). Building on the idea that the oils are health-promoters which increase
metabolic efficiency, the never-viable "rate of aging" theory was
resuscitated: The anti-respiratory effect of PUFA is used (illogically) to
return to the idea that aging occurs in proportion to the amount of oxygen
consumed, because animals which lack the supposedly essential nutrients
("defective animals") consume oxygen rapidly--burning calories rapidly, they
are supposed to be like a candle that won't last as long if it burns
intensely. The old theory is simply resuscitated to explain why the anti-
respiratory action of PUFA might be beneficial, justifying further promotion
of their use as food and drugs.

Ordinarily, in biochemistry and physiology the inhibition of an enzyme is
taken as a suggestion of toxicity, but when the point of reference is the idea
of the goodness of PUFA, the _activity_ of an intrinsic enzyme is taken to be
evidence of harm, and its _inhibition_ (by PUFA) is taken to be the proper,
healthful situation. The enzyme that produces the Mead fatty acid is strongly
inhibited by PUFA seed oils (less strongly by fish oils), and so the presence
of the Mead acid in the tissues is taken as evidence that the animal is
suffering damage resulting from the absence of PUFA. The Mead acid happens to
have some valuable anti-inflammatory effects, and is associated with many
biological advantages, but research in that direction is prevented by the lack
of funding.

By 1920, the polyunsaturated fatty acids were recognized to inhibit
proteolytic enzymes. At that time, the production of unsaturated fat was
considered to be a feature of certain pathogens, able to overcome the
proteolytic-phagocytic functions of the immune system.

Scattered studies have found that polyunsaturated fats inhibit the proteolytic
enzymes involved in the digestion of food, in the removal of clots, in the
formation of thyroid hormone, and many other essential physiological
processes. But currently, the only implication being drawn from this broad
class of effects of the PUFA is that some proteolytic enzymes are involved in
disease processes, and consequently increased consumption of PUFA would be
appropriate, because of their ability to suppress a conditionally harmful
proteolytic enzyme. Since the organism consists mainly of proteins, there are
complex innate systems for regulating the proteolytic enzymes, activating or
inactivating them as needed, and such complexity isn't likely to depend on
variable, unstable dietary factors. Exogenous substances that inhibit some
proteases could create an unlimited variety of functional and anatomical
irregularities.

Some of the interesting enzymes affected specifically by polyunsaturated fatty
acids are those involved in hormone production. While they inhibit the
formation of progesterone and androgens, they activate the synthesis of
estrogen, which in turn activates the release of more free polyunsaturated
fatty acids from the tissues, in a positive feedback pattern.

The inhibition of detoxification enzymes by PUFA (Tsoutsikos, et al., 2004)
affects many processes, such as the elimination of estrogen, contributing to
the positive feedback between estrogen and the oils. The meaning of this tends
to be lost, because of the estrogen industry's effective campaigns.

Another situation in which fatty acids participate in a positive feedback
system is the stress reaction, in which the released fatty acids impair
mitochondrial energy production, increasing the stress and leading to further
release of fatty acids.

One of the perennial theories of aging that has remained viable is the
metaplasm/lipofuscin/age pigment theory, the idea that a toxic material
accumulates in tissues over time. The age pigment contains proteins, cross-
linked PUFA, and metals. The inhibition of proteolytic enzymes is involved in
its accumulation, and the ratio of PUFA to saturated fatty acids is an
important factor in its formation. Estrogen is one of the factors that can
promote the formation of age pigment, probably partly because its lipolytic
action increases the cells' exposure to free fatty acids. The lipofuscin
contributes to inhibition of proteolysis, probably partly through increased
production of free radicals and hydrogen peroxide.

The proteolytic enzymes are an essential part of innate immunity, and the
highly unsaturated fatty acid, EPA, which is the most immunosuppressive of the
fats, strongly inhibits proteolysis in some cells. The natural killer (NK)
cells and phagocytic cells are two types of cell that are suppressed by PUFA,
and they are involved in many kinds of physiological events, not just the
killing of tumor cells and virus infected cells.

The immunosuppressive effects of PUFA are very general. Many metabolites that
are known to have harmful effects on the immune system are increased by the
PUFA (histamine [Masini, et al., 1990], serotonin, lactate, nitric oxide
[Omura, et al., 2001]). These substances are also involved in tumor
development.

Besides inhibiting enzymes and being converted into prostaglandins, the
polyunsaturated fatty acids have direct effects, as signals (or interference
with signals) on many tissues. The belief that the PUFA are essential
nutrients has influenced the way cellular excitability thresholds are being
interpreted. Anxiety and panic may be interpreted as alertness, calmness may
be interpreted as stupidity. Specifically, long-term potentiation (LTP) may
contribute to seizures, senility, and excitotoxicity, as well as to learning,
but many titles and conclusions equate increased LTP with "improved LTP,"
implying that it has biological value to the animal.

The ability of nerve cells to become quiescent after excitation is essential
to learning and perception. This ability is lost with aging, as the functional
balance in the brain shifts away from GABA-ergic to glutamatergic nerves. The
polyunsaturated fatty acids promote the excitatory nervous state. The
combination of respiratory inhibition with excitation can produce excitotoxic
cell death. If the doctrine of "essentiality of PUFA" hadn't been so
influential, different interpretations of excitatory thresholds, energy
metabolism, and even cell structure would have been allowed to develop more
fully.

The concentration of polyunsaturated fats in the brain has led many people to
say that the "nutritionally essential fatty acids," especially the omega -3
fatty acids, are essential for brain development (for the formation of nerve
cell membranes), and for the formation of synapses, and that increasing the
amount of those fats in the diet would be desirable. The types of argument
they use simply ignore the real evidence **:** Cells can multiply indefinitely
in culture dishes without the essential fatty acids, insects can multiply for
generations on diets without the unsaturated fats, forming normal synapses and
brains, and mammals fed diets with extremely small amounts of the unsaturated
fats grow with perfectly normal--possibly superior--brains.

One of the fats in the omega -9 series, that the human body can synthesize,
nervonic acid, is a major constituent of brain tissue, but its important
functions in brain development have hardly been investigated. Unlike the
unsaturated fatty acids oleic acid, linoleic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA), nervonic acid isn't associated with the "coronary risk factors," and it
has been suggested that it might be used in adults to prevent obesity-related
diseases. (Oda, et al., 2005).

One major area of research that has been neglected involves the role of fats
in modifying the ways in which proteins and nucleic acids interact with water
--arguably the most basic of all physiological processes. Unsaturated fats are
more water soluble than saturated fats, and they are involved in many problems
of permeability and edema.

In aging and evolution, there are systematic changes in tissue water content
that appear to correspond to changes in rate of metabolism, to the degree of
unsaturation of cellular fats, and to thyroid function and temperature.
Metabolic intensity and longevity can be modified by changing the degree of
saturation of fats in the diet and tissues, but--despite almost a century of
sporadic investigations--no one has yet worked out in detail the most
appropriate way to do this. But it has become clear that the "uncoupled"
mitochondrion, that "wastes oxygen and calories," is protective against free
radicals, cancer, and aging. Thyroid hormone and the absence of PUFA are
important factors in supporting the "wasteful" mitochondrion.

Although the complex interactions of anatomy, energy, temperature, fat
nutrition, tissue water content, and hormones haven't been systematically
investigated, some of the principles regarding the biological suitability of
specific fats are already being applied in the limited context of therapy.

At present, the most important issue is to recognize the dangers presented by
the intrusion of corporate power into science, especially as it relates to
nutrition and medicine, and to consider the implications of the known effects
of the PUFA on all of our biological systems.

The food-derived polyunsaturated fatty acids play important roles in the
development of all of the problems associated with aging--reduced immunity,
insomnia, decreased learning ability, substitution of fat for muscle,
susceptibility to tissue peroxidation and inflammation, growth of tumors,
etc., and are probably involved in most other health problems, even in
children. If research hadn't been guided by the economic interests of the seed
oil industry, many of those problems would have been solved by now.

The influence of the mass media on science can be seen in two issues that are
currently well known.

A popular test used for evaluating diabetes is the measurement of glycated
hemoglobin, the attachment of a sugar-like fragment to the protein of
hemoglobin. This is used to judge whether blood sugar is being controlled
adequately. The glycation of proteins is widely believed to be a central
process in aging, and is often used to argue that people should reduce their
sugar consumption.

Another well publicized problem supposedly involving the reaction between
sugars and proteins has to do with the discovery of the carcinogen,
acrylamide, in breads and french fries. The Whole Foods Market was sued in
California for selling whole wheat bread without a warning that it contained a
carcinogen.

But the changes in proteins that occur in diabetes are mainly produced by the
breakdown products of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Acrylamide is produced
largely by the reaction of PUFA with proteins.

Sugar, by reducing the level of free fatty acids in the body, actually tends
to protect against these toxic effects of the PUFA. Diabetes, like cancer, has
been known for a long time to be promoted by unsaturated oils in the diet,
rather than by sugar. The seed oil industry has been more effective than the
sugar industry in lobbying and advertising, and the effects can be seen in the
assumptions that shape medical and biological research.

1-adrenoceptor-mediated contractile responses and inositol phosphate formation
in rat cardiomyocytes.** Reithmann C, Scheininger C, Bulgan T, Werdan K. The
results presented show that **chronic n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid
pretreatment of rat cardiomyocytes leads to a marked impairment of alpha
1-adrenoceptor-induced positive inotropic effects and induction of arrhythmias
concomitant with a n-3 fatty acid-induced decrease in IP3 formation.**

by the load, a small amount of daily EPA intake clearly decreased fibrinolytic
activity and increased coagulation activity.**

high-fat-fed mice are linked to high glycotoxin intake.** Sandu O, Song K, Cai
W, Zheng F, Uribarri J, Vlassara H. These results demonstrate that the
development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes during prolonged high-
fat feeding are linked to the excess AGEs/advanced lipoxidation end products
inherent in fatty diets.

Nutr Cancer 1998;30(2):137-43. **Effects of dietary n-3-to-n-6 polyunsaturated
fatty acid ratio on mammary carcinogenesis in rats.** Sasaki T, Kobayashi Y,
Shimizu J, Wada M, In'nami S, Kanke Y, Takita T. "Dietary fat was fed to the
rats as 10% of the total feed weight, starting two weeks before the
initiation. An increase in the n-3/n-6 ratio did not suppress the incidence or
reduce the latency of mammary tumor development. The number and weight of
mammary tumors per tumor-bearing rat tended to be large in the group with an
n-3/n-6 ratio of 7.84 compared with those in the other groups. **As the
n-3/n-6 ratios were elevated, the total number and weight of tumors increased
gradually."** "These results suggested that the increase in the n-3/n-6 ratio
of dietary fat with the fixed PUFA-to-saturated fatty acid ratio cannot
suppress the mammary carcinogenesis but can promote development of tumors,
despite reduced PGE2 concentration in the tumor."

susceptible to peroxidation are increased in plasma and tissue lipids of rats
fed docosahexaenoic acid-containing oils.** Song JH, Fujimoto K, Miyazawa T..
"Thus, high incorporation of (n-3) fatty acids (mainly DHA) into plasma and
tissue lipids due to DHA-containing oil ingestion may undesirably affect
tissues by enhancing susceptibility of membranes to lipid peroxidation and by
disrupting the antioxidant system."

Diabetes Nutr Metab. 2002 Aug;15(4):205-14. **Long-term effect of fish oil
diet on basal and stimulated plasma glucose and insulin levels in ob/ob
mice.** Steerenberg PA, Beekhof PK, Feskens EJ, Lips CJ, Hoppener JW, Beems
RB. We have investigated, in comparison to low and high fat diets, the effect
of a fish oil diet on basal and stimulated plasma glucose and insulin levels
in male and female ob/ob mice. Intercurrent deaths were found especially in
the fish oil diet group. Compared to the other diet groups, plasma insulin
levels of the fish oil diet group were significantly increased 3 months after
the start of the diet and remained higher for another 3 months. At 12
months, microscopy revealed an increased severity of hepatic brown pigment
accumulation and extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen of mice fed with
fish oil. Fish oil diet also increased intercurrent mortality. However, a
consistent course of death could not be established using morphological
parameters.

J Biol Chem. 2002 Feb 15;277(7):5692-7. **Unsaturated fatty acids inhibit
cholesterol efflux from macrophages by increasing degradation of ATP-binding
cassette transporter A1.** Wang Y, Oram JF. These findings raise the
possibility that an increased supply of unsaturated fatty acids in the artery
wall promotes atherogenesis by impairing the ABCA1 cholesterol secretory
pathway in macrophages.

J Biol Chem. 2005 Oct 28;280(43):35896-903. Epub 2005 Aug 23. **Unsaturated
fatty acids phosphorylate and destabilize ABCA1 through a phospholipase D2
pathway.** Wang Y, Oram JF. "ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1 mediates
the transport of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to HDL
apolipoproteins and thus modulates HDL levels and atherogenesis. Unsaturated
fatty acids, which are elevated in diabetes, impair the ABCA1 pathway in
cultured cells by destabilizing ABCA1 protein." "Unsaturated but not saturated
fatty acids stimulated phospholipase D (PLD) activity, the PLD inhibitor
1-butanol prevented the unsaturated fatty acid-induced reduction in ABCA1
levels, and the PLD2 activator mastoparan markedly reduced ABCA1 protein
levels, implicating a role for PLD2 in the ABCA1 destabilizing effects of
fatty acids." "These data provide evidence that intracellular unsaturated
acyl-CoA derivatives destabilize ABCA1 by activating a PLD2 signaling
pathway."

Isr J Med Sci. 1996 Nov;32(11):1134-43. **Diet and disease--the Israeli
paradox: possible dangers of a high omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid diet.**
Yam D, Eliraz A, Berry EM. Thus, rather than being beneficial, high omega-6
PUFA diets may have some long-term side effects, within the cluster of
hyperinsulinemia, atherosclerosis and tumorigenesis.
