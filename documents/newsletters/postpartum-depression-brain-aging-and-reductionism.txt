Postpartum depression, brain,
aging, and reductionism
There’s an important trend in medicine toward
an enforced conformity, based on “evidence-basedguidelines for diagnosis and management,” andthis is associated with a campaign to changemedical education, eliminating the “basic science”instruction (biochemistry, molecular biology,neuroscience, physiology) of the first two years ofmedical school as a waste of time.  Vinay Prasad(2013) has said that those subjects are worse than awaste of time, because they “encourage a danger-ous cognitive bias: subordinating evidence-basedmedicine to pathophysiological reasoning,” whichplays “a key role in popul arizing unproven medical
practices.”
Since very large, expensive, studies (random-
ized, controlled trials) are the “gold standard” ofmedical practice, “evidence based” medicine is away to herd individual practitioners into a way ofdoing medicine that maintains the profits of thecorporations that are able to fund the studies thatare big enough to be acceptable to those who setthe standards. It’s true that the “pathophysiologicalreasoning” based on knowledge of the basicsciences has very often been wrong, but thesolution is to improve the quality of the basicscience education, rather than abandoning activereason in favor of passively following guidelinesestablished by the corporations with their interestin the most profitable treatments.
About 12% of new mothers in the US, and a
higher percentage in less industrialized countries,experience serious depression in the first several
months after the birth ; when the birth is premature,
the percentage is much higher. Women whopreviously experienced premenstrual symptoms,
and who had various symptoms during pregnancy,are more likely to have serious postpartum depres-sion. Hair loss, seizures, rapid bone loss, edema,fainting, fibromyalgia, joint pain, insomnia, andhypertension are sometimes associated with thedepression.
Physiological reasoning will
lead to mistaken conclusions ifthe properties of the factorsinvolved are misunderstood.
The FDA has approved the first treatment for
postpartum depression (PPD), and the companyplans to charge $34,000 for the drug, which has tobe administered intravenously in a hospital, during60 hours. The drug is allopregnanolone, the mainmetabolite of progesterone in the brain. Takingprogesterone reliably increases the brain contentof allopregnanolone, with a small oral dose ofprogesterone tripling (196% increase) the concen-tration of allopregnanolone (Andréen, et al.,2006). Supplementing pregnenolone alsoincreases allopregnanolone.
The approval of the “New Drug,” Zulresso,
was possible because of the recognized commit-ment of the FDA, the insurance industry, and alarge part of the medical profession, to the ideathat each disease can be treated by a specific drug,and that the only way to have confidence that theright drug has been chosen, is to permit a monop-oly that will justify the investment needed forresearch. The FDA has been committed to theprivatization of generic drugs for many years; forexample, a cheap drug, gamma hydroxybutyrate,Ray Peat's Newsletter

When some older methods of treating sickness
are used instead of “Evidence-Based” treatments,doctors risk losing their license. Some doctors stillprefer to use reasoning, rather than authority, toguide their practice. When medical reasoning fails,it’s usually because the facts taken into account aremistaken. The basic assumption of medical reduc-tionism is that the parts of a system can be under-stood and defined, and that t hose definitions can be
trusted as a basis for pathophysiological reasoning.To the extent that the interests of the drug industryhave guided research, publication, and education,the facts, the “basic sciences,” have to bereconsidered. 
Whenever a major industry sells
a substance, with profits of billionsof dollars, reasoning involving thatsubstance should begin with askeptical and detailed investigationof the substance, in as many differ-ent contexts as possible.
The problems that occur in the months after
having a baby have, historically, been treated in agreat variety of ways. Chamomile tea (Chang andChen, 2016), massage, and counseling seem to beeffective. The popularity of the “selectiveserotonin reuptake inhibitors,” SSRI, has led totheir frequent use for postpartum depression:“Despite the lack of good-quality evidencecomparing SSRIs with placebo directly, SSRIs arelikely to be beneficial for the treatment of postnataldepression based on evidence of their effectivenessin treating depressive disorders in general, and alsoin the treatment of premenstrual dysphoricdisorder” (Craig, 2016).
The popularity of the SSRI antidepressants,
which is heavily influenced by advertising, leadsto their use for PPD despite the absence of specificevidence, and despite the clearly establishedharmful side effects, especially bone loss, which is
already a major postpartum problem (Weaver, etal., 2019; Weaver and Hernandez, 2018; Weaver,et al,, 2018). Several studies have reported thatthey increase estrogen or its effects (Kempan, etal., 2011, Lupu, et al., 2017, Hansen, et al., 2017,Shea, et al., 2019), and there is evidence that theyincrease breast cancer mortality (Busby, et al.,2018). The pharmaceutical myth about serotonin,the “happy hormone,” has led most people, evenresearchers, to ignore the fact that it increasesinflammation and activates the stress system,while reducing the efficiency of energyproduction.
Drug company manipulation of information
about estrogen has been more extreme than itstreatment of serotonin. Activated by stress, alongwith serotonin, it is one of the major activators ofthe corticotropin release hormone, CRH, whichactivates the pituitary and adrenal glands, andpromotes inflammation, and is a major factor inPPD (Glynn and Sandman, 29014, Hahn-Holbrook, 2016), as well as in other types ofdepression, and aging, and Alzheimer’sdisease.  CRH activates aromatase, creating apotential vicious circle, but progesterone canprevent that effect (Roy, et al., 1999). CRH inhib-its progesterone production, while increasingestrogen (Jeschke, et al., 2005; Yang, et al., 2006;Stamatelou, et al., 2009; Gao, et al., 2012).
Estrogen increases the brain’s capacity to
synthesize serotonin (Hiroi, et al., 2006). If itweren’t for the advertising culture, it wouldprobably be generally recognized that both estro-gen and serotonin have important roles in causingdepression, migraine, and Alzheimer’s disease, allof which occur much more often in women than inmen. 
Physiological reasoning will lead to mistaken
conclusions if the properties of the factorsinvolved are misunderstood. Whenever a majorindustry sells a substance, with profits of billionsof dollars, reasoning involving that substanceshould begin with a skeptical and detailed investi-gation of the substance, in as many differentcontexts as possible.
In the 1960s, Fritz Verzar found that treating
animals with estrogen accelerated the aging oftheir connective tissues, modifying their collagen.2Later, A.V. Everitt reviewed studies in rabbits
showing that the endogenous estrogen ofpregnancy increased the stiffness of their connec-tive tissues, but that the continuing increasedproduction of progesterone between littersreversed that effect. They found that the connec-tive tissues of animals that had borne many littersseemed to be younger than the tissues of animalsof the same age that had never been mated.
In women, MRI images show (Hoekzema, et
al., 2017) that the grey matter of the brain shrinksconsiderably during pregnancy, similar to thechanges of advanced aging, and in some womenthese changes were still present after two years.However, another study has found a very rapidrestoration of brain structure in the second postpar-tum month. In these healthy women, the brainrestoration in that two month period was equiva-lent to five years of rejuvenation (Luders, et al.,2018).
In healthy women, progesterone in the postpar-
tum period is much higher than beforepregnancy—seven times higher in the plasma,three times higher in the cerebrospinal fluid (Datta,et al., 1986). This corresponds to the time of brainrestoration. Many studies over the last 60 yearshave shown the positive effects of progesterone onbrain development—increasing the size of thebrain, the thickness of the cortex, the resistance toinjury, and the quality of functioning. 
For at least as long, the opposite effects of
estrogen on the brain have been shown in a greatvariety of situations. Prenatally, an excess of estro-gen inhibits cell growth, resulting in a smallerbrain at birth, with a thinner cortex. In matureanimals, it can cause seizures and excitotoxic celldeath.
Despite the fact that hundreds of millions of
women have been treated for decades with estro-gens, only a few studies have bothered to seewhether its effects on the human brain are similarto the effects seen in the animal studies.  In avariety of situations, they have reported that estro-gen treatment causes reduction of grey matter inthe brain; as the grey matter volume decreases, thefluid volume increases. 
For example: “HT users had significantly less
gray matter and more cerebrospinal fluid thannonusers,” Greenberg, et al., 2006); “We found ahighly significant negative correlation of regional
gray matter volume in the anterior cingulatecortex with estradiol concentrations,” De Bondt,et al., 2013; people currently receiving hormonetreatment “had significantly smaller ratios of graymatter to ICV and increased atrophy (CSF/ICVratio),” Ryan, et al., 2014; “HT [hormone therapy]had adverse effects on GM [grey matter] volumesand risk for cognitive impairment and dementia inolder women,” Zhang, et al., 2016. Espelund, etal, 2015, observed shrinkage in the brains of olderdiabetic women receiving hormone therapy, andSeiger, et al., 2016, reporte d that in male to female
transexuals receiving estrogen and anti-androgens,there was shrinkage in the hippocampal region,with enlargement of the ventricles, i.e., more fluid.
Cholesterol is the precursor to pregnenolone,
progesterone, and the other neurosteroids, and itsown properties include stabilizing effects similarto progesterone’s. Normally, cholesterol, likeprogesterone, is higher during the postpartummonths. Several studies have observed an associa-tion of lower postpartum cholesterol withsymptoms of anxiety and depression (Ploeckinger,et al., 1996, Nasta, et al ., 2002, Troisi, et al., 2002,
Troisi, et al., 2018). With insufficient cholesterol,the normally high postpartum concentration ofprogesterone isn’t likely to be maintained, andinstead of brain restoration, the variouspro-inflammatory effects of serotonin and estro-gen will predominate, with effects such as depres-sion, joint pain, anxiety, and brain edema. 
Stress is experienced when processes that are
normally adaptive begin to have maladaptiveeffects. That happens when the organism’sresources aren’t adequate to meet the demands ofthe situation. The stimulation of CRH productionby histamine, serotonin, endorphins, IL-1, nitricoxide, and/or estrogen in good health leads to theactivation of complex and appropriate antistressreactions. When stress is very intense orprolonged, or if nutrition hasn’t been adequate, allof the activating signals, CRH itself, and the antis-tress glucocorticoids, can produce effects thataren’t integrated into the organism’s functions asit confronts its problems, and that producesymptoms and, eventually, degenerative processesand aging. That failure of integration is almostalways the result of insufficient metabolic energy.3In pregnancy, the placenta serves as a large
antistress organ that increases the mother’s adapt-ability, but it and the growing fetus increase themother’s nutritional needs. The role of nutrition inpreventing toxemia of pregnancy was shownclearly by Tom Brewer, Douglas Shanklin, and JayHodin, but there has been less attention to theadaptational problems of the mother following thebirth. Tom Brewer emphasized the importance ofprotein and salt, but he generally recommendeddrinking two quarts of milk daily duringpregnancy, and three quarts daily during lactation.A study in Japan asked women during pregnancyhow much milk they had drunk in the precedingmonth. Based on that small amount of information,they saw a 49% reduction of the incidence ofpostpartum depression in those who drank themost milk (Miyake, et al., 2016).
The importance of salt and calcium in
pregnancy relates to their effects on the respiratoryenergy system, and the fact that these effects aren’twidely known has led most doctors to believe thata diet that supplies “all the required nutrients” isadequate for pregnancy and lactation. Despite thepresence of all the required nutrients, that wouldbe adequate for someone with a generally suppor-tive environment, a “good” diet won’t necessarilybe adequate for someone with a problematicenvironment, or a history of stressful experiences. 
The levels of aldosterone and parathyroid
hormone are increased by stress, with serotoninacting on the adrenal cortex and the parathyroidgland to increase their secretion. All three of thosehormones act on the mitochondria to lower oxida-tive energy production. Increasing the amount ofsodium and calcium (and vitamin D, which alsohelps to lower parathyroid hormone and aldoster-one) in the diet can lower the secretion of aldoster-one and parathyroid hormone, with a resultingincreasing in oxidative energy production. 
The use of SSRI antidepressants has increased
greatly in the last 20 years. Recently, doctors,fearing that the strange new drug, allopreg-nanolone, could appear in the mother’s milk andaffect the baby, have said that breast feedingwould have to be stopped during the treatment, sothey prefer, as “first line treatment” for postpartumdepression, the standard SSRIs. Used duringpregnancy, those chemicals increase birth defects,but the benefit is usually considered to be worth
the harm.That has seemed to be the only medicalconsideration; the effect on the mother’s healthseems to be of no interest. The activation of thestress system by serotonin affects the mother’sability to support the gestation; there is evidencethat use of the SSRI in the 2nd and 3rd trimestersincreases premature delivery (Huybrechts, et al.,2014). Those same changes contribute to postpar-tum depression.
In this situation, the people who say medicine
should be guided by authoritative studies, ratherthan by so-called pathophysiologcal reasoning,might seem to have a case, since a progesteronemetabolite, even when it’s dissolved with a cyclo-dextrin and administered intravenously, is likelyto be more helpful than the usual antidepressants.But the use of antidepressa nt drugs isn’t guided by
biological reasoning, it’s guided by advertising,and the anti-biological beliefs associated withserotonin.  
Physiological reasoning would use the avail-
able knowledge about the nature of pregnancy andthe nature of stress, and would identify the mostimportant factors that can be optimized with exist-ing resources. Healthier pregnancies will result inhealthier and happier postpartum life. 
Some of these factors would be sunlight,
vitamin D, milk, cheese, eggs, fruits and wellcooked vegetables, fibrous foods, and optimizingthyroid function and pregnenolone and progester-one (which support mitochondrial function,protecting against aldosterone, parathyroidhormone, excess serotonin, CRK, and cortisol,besides increasing allopregnanolone), and usingthe safest antiinflammatory and antiserotonindrugs, such as aspirin and cyproheptadine, whenthey are needed.
