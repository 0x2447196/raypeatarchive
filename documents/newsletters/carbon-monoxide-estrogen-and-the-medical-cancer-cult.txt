THE ORIGINAL ARGUMENT:
Cancer istheresult ofordinary physiological
processes which become autonomous because of
regulatory weaknesses intheorganism.
Respiration isessential forthemaintenance of
thehigher forms oflife, and itisarespiratory
'defect, onboth the cellular and theorganismic
levels, which allows cancer topersist anddevelop.
The heme group, because itserves many respi-
ratory functions--hemoglobin, mitochondrial respi-
ratory enzymes, steroid synthesizing enzymes,
formation of thyroid hormone, detoxifying
enzymes--is regulated inrelatively primitive ways
within each cell, and inmore complex ways at
higher organismic levels.
When thecell needs more respiratory energy,
some fuel isdiverted into theproduction ofporphy-
rin, which isthen turned into heme, which would
normally provide forthe efficient production of
energy andprotective factors.
When the efficient energy-producing systems
areblocked, byinjury, oxygen deficiency, toxins, or
bythelack ofone ormore essential nutritional
factors, heme production isactivated.
Excess heme isdestroyed bytheenzyme heme
oxygenase, which converts heme into biliverdin and
carbon monoxide. Both ofthese factors have effects
onthecellwhich arecharacteristic ofcancer.
Estrogen, radiation, chemical carcinogens, and
other forms ofstress, activate theheme oxygenase
enzyme.
Estrogen causes both porphyria and jaundice
and isassociated with increased formation ofcarbon
monoxide. Itinhibits many types ofliver function,
including detoxification.
The production ofcarbon monoxide bycancer
cells can account for cancer's self-sustaining,
"hereditary," property, without invoking genetic
mutations which arenow known tobeconsequences,
rather than causes ofcancer.
The production ofcarbon monoxide and biliv-
erdin can account formany ofthestructural and
biochemical abnormalities ofcancer cells, and for
their induction ofabnormalities inadjacent cells.
"Genetic" theories ofcancer have now reached
adead end, and the epigenetic, developmental-
physiological approach remains astheonly plausible
description ofcancer.Carbon monoxide, estrogen,
andthemedical cancer cult
Previously when Iwrote about therole of
endogenously formed carbon monoxide incancer,
Iprobably didn't sayenough about theway the
idea fitsinto ourcultural context. Ifanidea is
very different from theexisting cultural matrix,
it'sprobably useful toconsider itinitshistorical
setting, andtocontrast itstheoretic models and
implications with conventional models and
practices, besides looking atsome oftheevidence
thatcould confirm it.
During Otto Warburg's lifetime, many people
working onthecancer problem were sufficiently
aware ofhiswork (because ofhisNobel prize)
that they occasionally mentioned itdismissively.
Now, very fewpeople even know about hiscancer
research andhisconclusion that theprime cau,se :
ofcancer isacellular respiratory defect. Forabout
30years, thedunces were inconfederacy against
him, then they forgot what itwas about hiswork
thathadbothered them.
Dean Burk, who was head ofthe cell
biochemistry laboratory attheNIH formany
years, was theonly well known American who
defended Warburg's interpretation ofcancer, and
now thatthey both have died, cancer researchers
just don't feel theneed tomention Warburg's
work atall.
Inpractice, science isn't amatter ofarational
evaluation ofevidence, butrather it'samatter of
power, funding, andpropaganda. Inourculture,
theunderstanding ofcancer hasbeen guided since
thelate1940s bythepropaganda oftheAmerican
Cancer Society, supported bythecorporate cancer
industry and, especially since Nixon's War on
Cancer began in1971, bygovernment funding.
Warburg's work showed that anything which
causes tissue atrophy contributes tothedevelop-
ment ofcancer, and that interference with the
cells' ability touseoxygen forenergy production
was theessential factor incancer. Warburg was
exploring this simple deterministic biochemical,
physiological and developmental process in
Germany just asquantum mechanics wasdestroy-
ingclassical physics and Nazism was enforcing
thedogma ofgenetic determinism and eugenics.
The revision ofDarwinism taking place atthis
time turned thedoctrines ofrandom mutation of
genes and selection of"superior genes" into the
essential core ofbiology andmedicine.
The same concepts were used todescribe
socially undesirable people (people whose genes
had"degenerated") andthebiologically undesir-
able cells ofcancer.
There were reasons forcommerce andgovern-
ment tofavor atheory ofcancer inwhich amyste-
riously random process turned anormal cellintoa
deadly alien cell that multiplied wildly and
invaded and destroyed surrounding healthy
tissues. One reason was that causes ofcancer,
such assoot, radiation, and estrogen, would
become very unpopular ifthepublic recognized
thecausal pathways between them andcancer, and
polluters could besued oraccused ofmurder, and
drug companies would lose thechance tomarket
alloftheir injinitely profitable estrogens.
Andtheidea ofamysteriously mutated cancer
cellruled outtheidea ofanytherapy that would
cause thecancer toregress ordisappear ina
physiological manner that didn't harm anyother
part ofthebody. The already established treat-
ments ofsurgical removal, destruction byradia-
tion, ordestruction bycytotoxic chemicals were
justified bythedoctrine that tL'1etumor, theclone
ofcells produced from the mutant cell, was
irreversibly committed toitscondition.
The scientific foundation forthat view of
,cancer hasreally been destroyed over thelastfifty
years, butitisrare toencounter aphysician or
professor ofmedicine who isaware ofthat. Even
themajority ofbiology professors haven't realized
thedecisive nature oftheevidence against it,
because most ofthem don't read outside their own
specialty.
Oncology (which should mean thestudy of
tumors) isreally amedical religion, filled with
rituals and incantation-like use oflanguage.
Despite the abundant evidence that access to2
medical diagnosis andtreatment doesn't improve
health, most people aremysteriously bound tothe
"health care system." Hotels don't have 13th
floors, many people don't likeitwhen ablack cat
crosses their path, orthey knock onwood atodd
moments inaconversation, even though they
aren't superstitious. The culture influences behav-
ior,just bybeing there. When your friends recite
their version ofthemedical incantations, andyour
doctor repeats them while wearing awhite jacket
andexpensive shoes, itseems only decent togo
along with thesystem. Even ifpatients would like
toquestion their doctors' assumptions, they can't
doitsuccessfully within themedical culture, and
few people arewilling totake ahostile stance
toward asystem that monopolizes many useful
drugs.
The mutant cell/clonal theory ofcancer
reduces theissue toamatter ofchoosing thebest
way tokillthepatient's tumor without killing the
patient. Very slowly, thepractice ofusing asingle
modality against each type oftumor isbeing
replaced bytrials using several substances atthe
same time, orsequentially, and oncologists now
sometimes magnanimously allow their patients to
take vitamins aswell aspsychotherapy, though
many have feared thatthevitamins might interfere
with their work.
Outside themedical world ofoncogenes and
mutations, theunderstanding ofcancer asadisor-
ganization of metabolism and regulatory
processes isadvancing.
Johanes Muller argued in1840 that cancer
might originate atthe level oftissues, rather
than inthe nature' ofthe individual cells
making upthe tissue. More recently, David
Smithers described cancer asaproblem oforgani-
zation, analogous toatraffic jam, which can
disrupt the system even while noparticular
vehicle isdefective. Generally, this view speaks
ofa"cancer field," inwhich whole regions ofan
organ show different degrees ofaprecancerous or
cancerous state.
The "precancerous" condition ofsome ofthe
cells within thecancer field canbeshown tobe
induced bysomething emitted byseriously injured
cells nearby. Inradiation research, these effects
arenow described asthe"bystander effect," in
which unirradiated cells that are exposed to
radiation-damaged cells will develop some ofthe
physiological features oftheirradiated cells. Some
kind of"toxic signal" hasbeen released from an
injured cell, inducing asimilar injury inthe
healthy cells.
Irradiated tissues respond with most ofthe
features that are involved ingeneral systemic
stress--lipid peroxidation, free radicals, increased
glycolysis, and ashift ofmetabolism toward
production ofthe "emergency" factors that
increase resistance intheshort term. Other kinds
ofinjury--overstimulation orenergy deprivation,
forexample--cause cells toproduce thesame sorts
ofsignals that affect surrounding cells. The extra-
cellular matrix inwhich cells areembedded trans-
mits these signals, partly byundergoing itsown
transformation into adifferently structured matrix.
Systemic metabolic problems make local
problems worse, andifalocal injury isserious, it
can cause the liver toproduce stress-related
proteins called "acute phase proteins," including
fibrinogen and serum amyloids Aand P,
C-reactive protein, andother inflammation-related
proteins. These proteins areaprimitive sort of
immune system, that· can directly bind tosome
harmful substances. Endotoxin absorbed from
bowel bacteria isprobably thecommonest reason
forincreased production ofthese proteins. The
acute phase proteins contribute tothe develop-·
ment oftumors invarious ways. For example
fibrinogen degradation products are
pro-inflammatory. Although these arecalled acute
phase proteins, they sometimes might better be
called chronic inflammation proteins, since they
are associated with diabetes, cancer, and heart
disease.
The systemic principle ofcancer involves the
same inflammatory mechanisms that areinvolved
incirculatory diseases, strokes, multiple sclerosis,
multiple organ failure, etc. An inflammatory
process that isn't controlled causes blood vessels
toleak, andtheprocess ofdisposing oftheleaked
materials, ifthe leakage isextensive, leads to
reactions ofthe whole organism; usually, the
signals reaching thehigher levels oforganization
evoke astress-limiting response, and stability is
restored, but ifconditions aren't just right, the
stress-induced damage accumulates. With
repeated injury, andwith chronic accumulation of3
polyunsaturated fats, fibrosis, atrophy andinflam-
mation increase, and the energetic intensity of
corrective responses decreases.
The first reaction toserious injury, challenge
ordeprivation istoprepare forgrowth and cell
division. The simple production oflactic acid
when oxygen supply isn't adequate causes blood
vessels todilate. Energy production becomes
inefficient; the fatty acid enzyme
system isactivated, even when large amounts of
fatarebeing made available bylipolysis under the
influence ofstress. Inproportion tothechallenge,
capillaries become more permeable, andcells may
begin toenter thetissues from thebloodstream,
along with water and nutrients. Asurge ofcell
division allows renewal ofdamaged cells. Ifthe
inflammation persists, new capillaries grow, and
larger vessels develop. Some oftheimmigrant
cells may eat themselves todeath removing
debris, but others remain ascolonists. Every
inflammation isanincipient neoplasm. Anorgan
such astheintestine, theliver, ovary, orthymus
gland, isalways influx, renewing itscells, but
when that renewal isdisordered, thefunctions of
the organ change, such that we speak ofa
neoplasm, anew growth, which inasense is
new organ. Ithas been suggested (Zajicek) that
the neoplastic organ has anadaptive, 'survival
value, producing one ormore substances that the
body lacks.
Zajicek supports hisidea with careful analysis
ofcancer statistics, and points outthat it'svery
common fortheremoval ofalarge tumor tobe
followed quickly bythe appearance ofmyriad
small tumors. Hethinks itwould bebetter to
leave theoriginal tumor inplace. Hisorientation
isinthetradition of"chalone" research, inwhich
every tissue stops growing atthe proper time
because itemits asubstance which specifically
inhibits itsown growth. Over thelast50years the
idea has been confirmed bymany experiments,
butithasn't made any impression onthecancer
industry. Stating theidea invery broad terms, we
might say that aging orstress causes atrophic
processes including "sarcopenia" and
"osteopenia," thereduction ofthemass ofvarious
tissues below theproper level, andthattumors are
theresult ofanuneven attempt torestore the.
proper mass oftissue.
Ithink Zajicek's idea would bemore accept-
able ifitwere stated inmore general terms,
without denying thepossible role ofchalones, or
something like chalones that tends toprotect the
body orsuppress tumors. Using LeChatelier's
principle, *.that asystem adjusts todisturbance in
away that reduces thedisturbance, wecould say
that one function ofatumor might betodispose
ofsomething thathasdisturbed homeostasis.
For example, insulin resistance produces an
inability tooxidize glucose, andisassociated with
chronic hyperglycemia, or"type 2diabetes."
Diabetes ofthattype isassociated with ahigh risk
ofcancer (e.g., Yam, etaI.,1996). V.S. Shapot's
decades ofresearch ledhim todescribe atumor as
aglucose scavenger (1979). When thesystem is
disturbed bychronic hyperglycemia andaninabil-
itytouse glucose, a sort ofequilibrium will be
restored bytheproduction ofatumor that pumps
glucose out ofthe system. Although tumors
consume sugar andrelease lactic acid, they aren't
really living on the sugar, they are doing
something very odd: They convert alarge amount
ofglucose into fat,andthen oxidize thefat.The
enzyme system, fatty acid synthase (FAS), isan
effective way todispose ofglucose, because ofits
energetic. inefficiency.
-Allother way tolook atZajicek's idea isto
recognize thatthemain cause ofinsulin resistance
isthedietary consumption of(both omega -6and
omega -3)polyunsaturated fatty acid, andthatthe
fats produced bythe FAS intumor cells are
mainly saturated fatty acids, with some ofthe
antiinflammatory omega -9series. Inthis case,
Zajicek's suggestion that thetumor isproducing
something the body needs would beliterally
correct.
The same "epigenetic" processes that create
our organs, under new conditions can create
tumors. The doctrine ofgenetic determinism has
almost reversed thebasic meaning of"epigenetic,"
since developmental biologists talk asifdevelop-
ingorgans were allprogrammed inthegenome,
andthat they were created 'asiffrom ablueprint
contained inthegenes. During ordinary develop-
ment, wethink ofepigenesis asaprocess that
creates anorganism inacertain environment, and
werecognize that even theprotected intrauterine
environment allows great individuality of4
development, influenced byslight differences in
conditions ofnutrition, hormones, temperature,
etc., during anindividual's development. Epige-
nesis accounts foralotofnormal variation in
traits--size ofbrain and other organs, rate of
maturation, degree ofpigmentation, etc.--and for
many developmental defects. Epigenesis isan
even more important concept forunderstanding
tumors, despite thefact that somuch money has
been invested inexplaining tumors according to'
oncogenes andother ideological inventions ofthe
genetic determinists. Even oncogenes' expression
isenvironmentally determined.
The normal cyclic function oftheovaries isa
model forthe potentially creative role ofan
inflammation-like stress. Every month (in a
rhythm influenced bymany cues), aproductive
crisis comes toafocus intheovary, with the
formation ofestrogen, prostaglandins, carbon
monoxide, and other signal substances, causing
rapid changes both locally and systemically, with
water, hormones, and nutrients gathering around
theovum (aswell asinother parts ofthebody,
such asthefeet). Then asthefollicle ruptures with
the release of an ovum, the excitatory,
inflammation-like state isresolved, with a
massive increase intheproduction oftheantiin-
flammatory, ·antistress substance, progesterone,
leading tothe suppression ofthe excitatory
substances. These monthly processes aredevel-
opmental, they arepart oftheepigenetic devel-
opment oftheorgan.
Most, ifnotall,ofthesubstances involved in
ovarian physiology areinvolved inthediseases of
stress anddegeneration, which.progress inpropor-
tion totheinability toproduce theresolution of
inflammation andrestoration ofthestable condi-
tion. The ovary isamajor source ofestrogen,
which canproduce theexcited, activated, inflam-
matory andproliferative state inanytissue ofthe
body, though itactsmainly ontheuterus, breasts,
and pituitary. But theovary isalso, inresponse,
able toproduce massive amounts oftheprotective
progesterone, which interrupts theinflammatory
effects ofestrogen onthe various tissues and
organs, largely bysuppressing theproteins that
hold estrogen within cells (especially the"estro-
genreceptor"), butalso bychanging theactivities
of many enzymes away from the
estrogen-controlled, inefficient pattern. The
developmental actions ofthe ovary cause
continuing epigenetic processes in other
organs, causing noticeable changes intheir
structure every month.
The ovary' plays aspecialized coordinating
role inpreparing thewhole body forpregnancy,
butmost ofitsregulatory features canbeseen ina
diminished form inother organs, andinanytissue
that isunable tocompletely resolve acrisis of
inflammation. Considering ovarian processes and
structures indetail will offer some insights into
theprocesses that occur during inflam-
mation andtumefaction.
One oftherules ofclassical mechanistic
endocrinology was that ahormone doesn't acton
theorgan that produces it,and acts only onits
"target organ," one with thespecial "receptors"
that allow ittorecognize and respond tothe
hormone. But now, allorgans are known to
contain "estrogen receptors," and many ofthose
same organs canproduce very significant amounts
ofestrogen. The ovary, according totheclassical
doctrine, wouldn't beable torespond toestrogen.
Oral contraceptive manufacturers used thatidea to
argue that excessive estrogen couldn't cause
ovarian cancer, and' {;.fact prevented it,by
preventing ovulation. Butthecells oftheovary do
respond toestrogen, multiplying, and during in
vitro exposure, developing apre-cancerous
appearance. For more than 20years, there has
been clear evidence that use ofsupplemental
estrogen increases theincidence ofovarian cancer.
Related claims were made about estrogen and
theprostate gland formore than 50years: "Estro-
gencan't doanything toamale organ except to
decrease itsmaleness," that is,itcouldn't stimu-
latecelldivision orcause prostate cancer, butit
would cause theprostate toshrink, and prevent
prostate cancer. Many ofthose claims arestill
being made, andestrogen isstillbeing prescribed
totreat itbyalarge portion ofthemedical profes-
sion, though experiments aredemonstrating estro-
gen's clear contribution totheprostate gland's
degeneration intocancer.
The ovary hasbeen afocus ofseveral types of
ideology inbiology, aridasaresult realinvestiga-
tion ofovarian physiology hasbeen retarded for
100 years. Weismann's genetic doctrine ofthe5
"isolation ofthegerm line" ledtoafalse theory of
ovarian aging, theegg-depletion theory. Despite
theabsence ofevidence forthefinite-egg-supply
theory, and the increasing accumulation of
evidence that eggs arecontinually produced in
adult ovaries, many people still cling tothe
unfounded theory. The real nature ofovarian
aging isvery similar totheaging ofanyorgan,
andtheextreme specialization oftheovary makes
some oftheissues clearer when welook atanalo- .
gous processes inother organs, such asthe
prostate, orbreast, oruterus, orthe"adventitious .
organs" ofinflammation andtumefaction.
Inthenormal ovary, under theinfluence ofthe
pituitary follicle stimulating hormone, several
pockets offluid (primary follicles) begin forming
intheovary, and thelargest ofthese follicles
suppresses thedevelopment oftheothers, sothat
only oneusually reaches fulldevelopment. Under
theinfluence ofthepituitary luteinizing hormone,
progesterone, and other substances, the ovum
completes itsmeiosis, thefollicle ruptures andthe
ovum along with the fluid containing ahigh
concentration ofestrogen isreleased. The cells
that had surrounded and supported the ovum
(granulosa cells) multiply tofill the space,
forming thecorpus luteum, theyellow body that
produces mainly progesterone. The corpeus
luteum isathoroughly new organ that's produced
periodically, under the influence ofchains of
interacting stimuli.
Warburg's main point about cancer wasthatit
always hasa"respiratory defect," causing itto
produce lactic acid even inthepresence ofoxygen
(aprocess called aerobic glycolysis), while
oxygen causes normal cells tosuppress lactic acid
formation (this iscalled the Pasteur effect).
Warburg believed that this defect inthecells'
energy production system meant thatitlacked the
ability toperform many ofitsnormal functions,
but that itremained able todivide. Healso
believed thatoxygen deprivation wasoneofmany
stressors that could damage thecells' respiratory
system, and heshowed that even very' small
tumors areusually very hypoxic. Other experi-
menters (including Hans Selye) found that
mechanical barriers such asaglass tube orabent
piece ofplastic film implanted into ananimals
tissues would cause cancer todevelop among the
enclosed cells (following aperiod ofatrophy).
There areafew normal situations inwhich
aerobic glycolysis occurs--the n;tina, theovarian
follicle during itspreparation forovulation, the
Sertoli cells ofthetesticle, which areinvolved in
thematuration ofsperm cells, and sometimes in
theplacenta. Except fortheretina, these tissues
are subject tostrong stimulation byestrogen,
which stimulates lactic acid formation while inter-
fering with oxygen use. Aerobic glycolysis is
associated with theformation offatty acids (R.A.
Walli, 1978), bytheenzyme fatty acid synthase,
which isincreased byestrogen, andtheactivity of
which corresponds tothe malignancy ofmany
types ofcancer.
Estrogen and other stimuli can cause the
formation oflactic acid even inthepresence of
oxygen (i.e., aerobic glycolysis). Lactic acid has
some hormone-like actions, causing, forexample,
vasodilation and increased permeability ofcapil-
laries. Ithas been suggested that ithas some
involvement inthe process ofmeiosis, inthe
formation ofmature germ cells.
There aresome compartments inthebody that
have very little oxygen, and that aredamaged by
increased oxygen. The thymus maintains avery
low oxygen tension, but ithas astrong Pasteur
effect, sonormally doesn't produce excess lactic
acid. The testicle stops producing testosterone if
theoxygen isincreased too much. The vitreous
body oftheeyenormally haslow oxygen tension.
Aspecial feature oftheovary isthat thecells
around theovum arenotonly isolated from the
blood supply, causing localized hypoxia, butthey
arealso (unlike thehypoxic thymus) stimulated by
estrogen.
Intheexpanded ovarian follicle, theovum isa
considerable distance from the closest blood
vessels, and soitand itsadjoining cells receive
very little oxygen. Glucose diffuses into thefolli-
cle, and the granulosa cells around the ovum
metabolize itinto lactic acid. The concentration of
lactate inthefollicular fluid increases, along with
estrogen, asthe follicle matures, approaching
ovulation. Immediately following ovulation, the
granulosa cells multiply, filling thespace that was
formerly thefollicle, and theblood vessels that
had surrounded the follicle now infiltrate the6
developing corpus luteum, sothat itreceives an
abundant oxygen supply asitbegins forming
progesterone.
The permutations ofthese variations in
oxygen tension, glucose supply, and excitatory
stimulation canaccount foravariety ofdevelop-
mental processes, andtheresulting concentrations
oflactic acid, carbon dioxide, fatty acids, andpH
increase the range offormative possibilities.
Carbon monoxide has the ability tomimic'
hypoxia even inthepresence ofoxygen.
Estrogen, inmany different organs, increases
theproduction oftheenzyme heme oxygenase,
which produces carbon monoxide, which inhibits
respiration and also inhibits avariety ofenzymes
that usetheheme group. (Tian, etaI.,2003, 2004;
Tschugguel, etaI.,2001).
Intheovary, carbon monoxide increases the
production ofestrogen, butdecreases theproduc-
tion ofprogesterone. An excess ofestrogen,
acting partly through theincreased carbon monox-
ide, blocks theformation ofprogesterone, and
prevents asuccessful ovulation.
These arejust some oftheinteractions within
the ovary that are similar toprocesses inthe
cancerization process wherever itoccurs. Any
inflamed tissue becomes subject toestrogenic
stimulation, by the activation of enzymes,
especially beta-glucuronidase, which cause estro-
gen tobedeposited inthe cells. Any hypoxic
tissue, including inflammations ofany sort, will
express theheme oxygenase enzyme, producing
carbon monoxide. Presumably, intheshort term,
these increases ofestrogen and carbon monoxide
have their adaptive functions, such asstimulating
cell division forhealing, andblocking some kinds
offree radicals and excessive calcium uptake.
But, asintheovary, when thesystem isn't able to
suppress them, they become self-sustaining, and
begin tospread their influence toneighboring
cells. Cancer cells arevery resistant toinjury from
free radicals, which innormal cells accelerate the
spontaneous dissolution apoptosis, and
carbon monoxide isoneoftheir defense mecha-
nisms, that makes them relatively immortal
(Ghattas, etaI.,2002).
When anorganism isfunctioning normally
and adapting tostresses, the operation ofa
functional system, including the part ofthe
nervous system that coordinates the function,
causes that system tobestabilized, andtobecome
more efficient, and even togrow. Work causes
muscles and bones toenlarge and become
stronger, learning causes the brain togrow.
Chronic inflammations have some oftheproper-
tiesofafunctional system, with participation of
thenervous system, adjustments oftheimmune
system, and changes inthe circulatory system,
except thatthenormal anddesirable functions are
progressively lost, rather than improved. The
operation oftheshort term protective measures
contribute, ifthey persist toolong, toatrophy and
fibrosis, andpotentially, todisordered growth.
Insome cases, weknow that anexcess of
stimulation, inreaction tothe organ's reduced
functioning, promotes thegrowth andspread ofa
tumor, forexample, prolactin contributes tobreast
cancer, thyrotropic hormone tothyroid cancer, and
gonadotropin toovarian cancer. Ovarian teratomas
arenow believed tobeparthenogenic, deriving
from anunfertilized ovum, and Ihave suspected
that thedirection oftheir development reflects the
endocrine situation, forexample when ateratoma
consisting ofthyroid tissue appears inawoman
who hastaken extremc::ly bigdoses ofiodine fora
long time. ..' "'
Inthecltronic inflammatory state that devel-
ops with stress and aging, besides theextrinsic
stimuli that were thesubject matter ofclassical
endocrinology--pituitary hormones driving the
ovaries, ovarian hormones driving the uterus,
etc.--the inflamed tissues begin tostimulate
themselves: The breast anduterus begin tosynthe-
sizeestrogen, forexample.
Some ofthethings produced bytumors, such
asestrogen andcarbon monoxide, appear tobethe
result ofashort-term adaptive factor thatbecomes
maladaptive when thesystem can't turn itoff.It's
generally assumed that when atumor produces a
hormone, itseffects will necessarily beharmful,
but sometimes itisn't clear whether they are
harmful orbeneficial, and inafew cases, they
clearly seem tobebeneficial.
Many cancers cause agreat increase inthe
concentration ofcalcium intheblood, andthisis
often theresult oftheproduction ofparathyroid
hormone-related protein (pTH-rP) bythetumor.
Insome cases, PTH-rP can induce apoptosis by7
causing cells totake upcalcium, butinother cases
itisasurvival factor, forexample fornerve cells
inthe brain. Some experiments show that
increased calcium inatissue suppresses heme
oxygenase and carbon monoxide (Zhang, etaI.,
2003, 2004). PTH-rP and the parathyroid
hormone itself have some functions that overlap
with those ofvitamin D,which isnow known to
help tosuppress many cancers.
Inhibitors offatty acid synthase cause many
types ofcancer cells todie. Vitamin D,which
stops thegrowth ofbreast, prostate, and bowel
cancer cells, inhibits FAS (Qiao, etal.,2003).
This could beanother example ofZajicek's
principle, since ithas been discovered that
prostate andother cancer cells areable tocreate
the active form ofvitamin D.Vitamin D also
acts asanantiestrogen, andestrogen isafactor in
thedevelopment prostate cancer, breast cancer,
and many other types ofcancer (Swami, etaI.,
2000; Demirpence, etaI.,2001).
Insome cancers, vitamin Doperates through
ceramide (Pirianov and Colston, 2001), Palmitic
acid, isaproduct ofFASand acomponent of
cerami de,which inhibits cancer cellgrowth.
Understanding thecauses oftissue atrophy as
afailure ofenergy that allows inflammation to
become chronic, leading toadisorganized attempt
toregenerate tissue and stabilize thesystem, our
response toboth atrophy andcancer should beto
restore metabolic processes ofthehighest type,
based onthe oxidation ofglucose with the
production ofcarbon dioxide, rather than lactic
acid and fatty acids, and toeliminate inflamma-
tion and itsproducts that have disrupted the
normal balance between cell renewal and cell
elimination. Aspirin, byinhibiting theproduction
ofestrogen, ofcarbon monoxide, andofseveral
cytokines and toxic lipid products, and by
supporting normal respiration, helping tocorrect
hyperglycemia, and suppressing lactate
production, isanespecially valuable therapy.
Sacca etaI., have recently (October, 2004)
demonstrated that aspirin's anticancer effect
appears toinvolve the inhibition ofheme
oxygenase.
Caffeine, byinhibiting FAS and sparing
glucose, and inhibiting many ofthetoxic lipid
REFERENCESinflammatory mediators,
additive effects whenproducts and other
should have atleast
combined with aspirin.
Vitamin D,byitsantiestrogenic and antiin-
flammatory actions, and bysuppressing FAS,
parallels theeffects ofaspirin and caffeine in
several ways.
Gelatin, bylowering serotonin, should help to
prevent excessive activation ofheme oxygenase
andformation ofcarbon monoxide during injury
orstress (ontherole ofserotonin: Sharma and
Westman, 2003; Sharma, etaI.,2003).
The lower incidence of,and mortality from,
cancer athigh altitudes might partly beexplained
byexperiments that show that reduced atmos-
pheric oxygen tension down-regulates heme
oxygenase inhuman cells (Kitamuro, 2003).
