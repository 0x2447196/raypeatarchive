Progesterone, thyroid, cancer
Inthefirst half ofthetwentieth century, Otto
Warburg and Albert Szent-Gyorgyi proposed that
proliferation isthenatural "primordial" tendency
ofallcells, including those incomplex multicellu-
larorganisms, inwhich many cells remain ina
quiescent, non-proliferating state foryears. Their
orientation was similar tothat ofJohanes Muller,
who in1840 argued that cancer might originate at
thelevel oftissues, rather than inthenature ofthe
individual cells making upthetissue.
Both Warburg and Szent-Gyorgyi showed that
oxidative metabolism iscrucial inmaintaining the
relative quiescence that makes itpossible for
multicellular toexist and topreserve
their organization. Inthese organisms, theindivid-
ualcells areembedded inaglue-like matrix, inthe
case ofanimals, orinawoody scaffolding, inthe
case ofplants; theoxygen and nutrients needed by
thecells diffuse through thematrix, soitscondi-
tion iscrucial forthecells' functions. The
lular matrix, and thematerials that pass through
it,constitute the"field" within which cells develop
and function.
Early researchers understood that theconnec-
tive tissue matrix changes progressively inaging,
which isevident inthefact that themeat ofold
animals istougher than that ofyoung animals. Leo
Loeb, studying the effects ofestrogen onthe
uterus, showed that itincreased theformation of
collagen, causing cells tobeseparated from their
blood supply byathickened barrier ofwater and
collagen.
Estrogen, byaltering thecellmatrix, alters the
developmental field itself. Simply by creating a
thickened barrier, itmakes itdifficult forcells to
maintain their proper place intheorganism, and
some ofthem, intheenergy-deprived state, revert
totheprimordial proliferative state.
Thyroid hormone, the regulator ofoxidative
metabolism, isthebasic hormone making possible
therespiration which generates and sustains the
multicellular state.The simple idea ofantagonism between
hormones, forexample between catabolic and
anabolic steroids, orbetween progesterone and
estrogen, isfrrmly based onexperiments, butthere
isanattitude inmedical endocrinology, based on
thenames ofthesubstances, that insists ona
"synergy" between estrogen ("the hormone of
estrus, creating areadiness tocopulate") and
progesterone ("the hormone ofpregnancy").
Sequential, coordinated action isn't thesame as
synergy. Hunger canlead tosatiety, butnoone
denies that these are contrasting conditions.
Hundreds ofbiological actions created byestro-
genarereversed byprogesterone, andvice versa.
Shock, capillary leakage, excessive clotting of
the blood, epilepsy, goiter, hyperactivity, and
countless other biological problems arecreated by
anexcess ofestrogen, andnormalized byproges-
terone. Theproblem ofcancerization byestrogen,
and itsopposition byprogesterone, was clearly
defined byAlejandro Lipschutz more than fifty
years ago, butaseries ofdeliberate actions bythe
drug industry, and its"regulatory agencies," has
prevented a rational andcoherent approach tothe
useofhormones inpreventing andcuring cancer.
Forover fifty years, estrogen hasbeen widely
promoted fortheprevention and treatment of
various cancers, andthroughout the20th century
agents ofthedrug industry claimed thatitwasnot
carcinogenic, andprevented theUSgovernment
from classifying itassuch..During the same
period, and formany ofthesame commercial
reasons, natural progesterone has occasionally
been claimed either tocause cancer, ortobe
ineffective initstreatment. While billions of
dollars were spent in"cancer research," theuseful
basic knowledge about theprevention andcure of
cancer was ignored. Not just ignored, but
suppressed: Medical journals ofallsorts have
simply declined topublish favorable research on
progesterone, andmedical conferences onfemale
endocrinology that claim tobeopen toallviews
arenotopen tofavorable reports onprogesterone.
Some researchers have observed that only
about onepercent ofmedical research isscientifi-
cally sound, butthat view ignores thefactthat the
"valid onepercent" iscertainly going tobemisin-
terpreted, unless thereader understands that the
medical journals are intensely subjective and
biased inwhat they choose topublish, and that
they exclude theresearch that would provide the
essential contexts forevaluating thethings that
are published. Tofind anadequate context in
which tointerpret current research, wehave to go
back atleast fifty years, toatime when thescience
journals were relatively independent.
The idea of"genetic determination," which I
have written about many times, hasbeen useful to
thedrug industry. Ifmoderate amounts ofestrogen
didn't cause mutations ofcertain genes that were
thought todistinguish normal cells from cancer
cells, then how could itbecarcinogenic? And if
cancer cells are "genetically committed," then
only lethal cytotoxic methods could beconsidered
astherapies.
The history ofestrogen and progesterone
research offers analternative view ofcancer, and
ofphysiology itself. Inthe 1940s, Hans Selye
demonstrated that progesterone produced very
deep anesthesia, and that itsactions were essen-
tially instanteous. Estrogen's characteristic
actions, too (such asthe uptake ofwater by
tissues, andnervous excitation) were sorapid that
itwas clear thattheeffects were produced without
theactivation ofspecial "genes." Butthese quick
actions were generally ignored, because their
existence wasn't compatible with thedoctrine of
genetic determination.
Estrogen acts atmany different levels, modify-
ingthestate ofwater, ofproteins andfats, ofthe
immune, circulatory, andnervous systems. Itisn't
just a"carcinogen," orjust a"female hormone."
Many substances, processes, or conditions
(cholera toxin, x-rays, oxygen deprivation) imitate
many ofestrogen's effects.
Energy generates order, and maintains it.
Destruction oforder degrades theability ofcells
toproduce energy.2
Progesterone (and related substances), too, act
onmany levels oforganization atthesame time.
The interactions ofproteins andwater arechanged
immediately, with circulatory and nervous and
bioelectrical responses coinciding with changes of
cells' functions, including changes intheproteins
ofthe"receptor systems." The functional changes
that canbeseen inthefirst minutes ofprogester-
one's actions lead tometabolic changes andthen
tomore basic structural changes.
Stabilization and activation ofmitochondria
byprogesterone, andashift away from glycolysis
(Joe andRamirez, 2001: GAPDH inhibition), are
exactly theopposite ofestrogen's toxic effects on
the mitochondria (by increasing NO, for
example), andactivation ofglycolysis.
On the molecular level, progesterone and
estrogen have different structural effects, that
account fortheir globally opposite regulatory
effects. Their systematically different effects on
energy production lead toglobal differences inthe
regulation of cytokines, neurotransmitters,
hormones, andcellular organelles, which contrib-
utetomacroscopic shifts inthedistribution of
substances throughout the organism, including
water, fats, andthematerials such ascollagen and
glycoproteins that make upthe extracellular
matrix.
Ifprogesterone istobenamed "the hormone
ofgestation," then estrogen might becalled "the
hormone ofmiscarriage."
The characteristic metabolic end-product of
progesterone-dominated metabolism iscarbon
dioxide. During gestation, thefetus isexposed to
large amounts ofprogesterone and carbon
dioxide. Thevery high concentration ofprogester-
oneduring gestation keeps tissues from retaining
excess estrogen, even when estrogen ispresent in
theblood stream. The very high concentration of
carbon dioxide has many protective effects,
Every tumor isabiologically unique
substance, but itisbiologically compatible
with itshost. This isanalogous tothetissue
compatibility oftwins which share asingle
placenta, even though they may begeneti-
cally different fraternal twins.
including protection against theformation oflactic
acid.
The characteristic metabolic end-product of
estrogen-dominated metabolism islactic acid.
Increasing lactic acid displaces carbon dioxide.
Carbon dioxide combines spontaneously with
amine groups, asinthelysine residues ofproteins,
andthisinfluences theinteractions oftheproteins
with other substances, forexample, inhibiting
glycation ofproteins; protein glycation occurs
during stress and aging, and degrades the
functions ofproteins andcells andsystems. These
changes arebelieved tocontribute totheharden-
ingofconnective tissues with aging.
The fibrosis ofaging isassociated with a
generalized state ofinflammation, producing
catabolism and atrophy ofmost systems, with
isolated regions escaping the general cachexia,
and regenerating their cells and tissues indisor-
ganized ways, producing many abnormalities that
could bediagnosed as"precancerous," afew of
which develop intotumors.
A.V. Everitt's book onthepituitary andaging
mentions some studies that relate toprogesterone
andaging. Uterine collagen aging, which increases
under theinfluence ofestrogen, islowest inthe
oldrodents that have been bred themost often,
andthisisprobably partly theresult ofprogester-
one's action oncollagenase andfibroblasts, aswell
asitsability todisplace estrogen from thetissues.
Leo Loeb showed that excess estrogen andaging
both produced similar increases incollagen.
Alejandro Lipschutz found that chronic estrogen
treatment produced fibrosis ofpractically all
tissues, and that cancer later developed inthose
fibrotic tissues. Then hetested various steroids,
and found that progesterone had the strongest
antifibromatogenic action, and that pregnenolone
was next ineffectiveness. (Brief intermittent
exposures toestrogen didn't produce theharmful
effects, and now it's known that progesterone
decreases the tissues' retention ofestrogen.)
Lipschutz' 1950 book onsteroid hormones and
tumors summarizes hiswork.
Contemporaries of Loeb and Lipschutz,
Joseph Needham, C.H. Waddington andJ.W. Orr,
argued that cancer evolves through aseries of3
developments inthetissues, rather than insingle
cells.
Afewyears later, Hans Selye showed thatthe
partial isolation oftissue itself (for example,
growing inside asmall glass tube implanted ina
rat)caused atremendous acceleration oftheaging
process intheisolated cells andmatrix. Animper-
meable sheet ofplastic implanted inananimal
tends tocause acancer todevelop, ifitisfolded
toform aconcavity. The thickened connective
tissue matrix that develops with aging, irritation,
and stress creates innumerable areas inwhich
cells aresimilarly cutofffrom fullcontact with
their normal environment.
Estrogen treatment atmenopause produces
alkalosis and hyperventilation. Alkalosis stimu-
lates peroxidation and various other harmful
stress-products. Prenatally, ifestrogen excess
doesn't killthefetus, itretards itsbrain growth,
because many ofitsmetabolic actions arepower-
fully antigestational--actions that are used
medically inthecontraceptive pills and abortion
pills.
Allcancer cells produce lactate even inthe
presence ofoxygen, andthisincreases their intra-
cellular alkalinity, promoting swelling, calcium
uptake, and proliferation. Continued exposure to
lactic acid increases collagen formation andfibro-
sis.
Ithink ofhigh altitude asanalogous tothe
protected gestational state. (Both progesterone
and carbon dioxide are increased inpeople
adapted tohigh altitude.) Respiratory acidosis,
meaning theretention ofcarbon dioxide, isvery
protective, andisanoutstanding feature oflifein
theuterus. Even atthetime that anembryo is
implanting intheuterus, adequate carbon dioxide
iscrucial. Many ofthemysteries ofembryology
and developmental biology have been explained
bythepresence ofahigh level ofcarbon dioxide
during gestation. For example, aninjury tothe
fetus heals without scarring, thatis,with complete
regeneration instead oftheformation ofasortof
collagenous plug. Over thelastfifty years, several
people have discovered that simply enclosing a
wound (forexample anamputated finger tip)inan
air-tight compartment allows remarkably
complete regeneration, even inadults, who
supposedly have lost thepower ofregeneration.
(Exposure oftissues toaircauses them tolose
carbon dioxide.)
High altitude sickness isnow treated with
acetazolamide (which causes carbon dioxide
retention, andrespiratory acidosis), orwith direct
inhalation ofcarbon dioxide. Sleep apnea, which
hasbeen treated formany years with progesterone,
isnow being treated with acetazolamide, inrecog-
nition that itiscaused byalkalosis. Both proges-
terone and acetazolamide increase the carbon
dioxide content ofthetissues, bydecreasing sensi-
tivity tocarbon dioxide, yetthey both stimulate
respiration byincreasing sensitivity tooxygen
deprivation: (Wagenaar, etaI., 2000.) Drugs
similar toacetazolamide, sulfonamides thatinhibit
carbonic anhydrase, have recently been discovered
tostop thegrowth ofawide variety oftumors.
Carbon dioxide, progesterone, and the
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors stabilize andprotect
cells invery general ways. Forexample, they all
inhibit epileptic seizures. Allofthem areinvolved
inregulating calcium, preventing bone loss and
hypercalcemia. Incancer, hypercalcemia isvery
common, anditisimportant tobeable tocorrect
it,because uncontrolled calcium isprofoundly
dangerous. (In"Homeostasis" and other newslet-
ters Ihave written about the regulation of
calcium.)
Increased intracellular calcium isexcitatory,
and interferes with mitochondrial energy produc-
tion. Prolonged oxygen deprivation increases
intracellular calcium (Smith, etaI.,2001). When a
cancer cellinteracts with other cells, itcandisturb
their calcium regulation, and this can cause the
celltobreak itscontacts with other cells (Tsuji, et
aI.,2002), andincreased intracellular calcium can
cause acell toreorganize its intracellular
structure, and tobetransformed into spontane-
ously proliferating cells (Furst, etaI.,2002). The
intracellular architecture which isdepolymerized
bycalcium excitation forms alink between the
extracellular matrix andtheregulation ofgenes in
thenucleus. Generally, things (estrogen, prolactin,
alkalinity, swelling, cadmium, iron) that increase
intracellular calcium increase cellular
proliferation. Drugs that decrease intracellular4
calcium areincreasingly being seen tostop the
proliferation ofcancer cells.
Increased intracellular calcium also increases
theformation ofcollagen, and drugs thatdecrease
intracellular calcium decrease collagen secretion.
Ifcancer consists ofaspontaneous process of
healing andregeneration that goes wrong because
ofchanges initsenvironment, because ithaslost
contact with its"formative field," then theonly
reasonable approach totheprevention and treat-
ment ofcancer istorestore that formative field.
The conditions ofgestation, formammals, consti-
tuteaformative field inthehighest degree thatwe
know.
During gestation, after organs have differenti-
ated, nerve cells extend their fibers from thebrain
toinnervate muscles andother tissues. The special
conditions oflife inthe uterus support this
process, butsomething similar canhappen during
adult life, when damaged nerves regenerate. A
major difference between injury tothefetus, and
injury toanadult, isthat thewound regenerates
perfectly without ascar inthefetus, butinthe
adult, regeneration isoften impaired, and a
connective tissue scar replaces normally function-
ingtissue.
The intestinal nerves ofstressed animals have
been found tofragment; before theaxons actually
break, they form beads. (Beaded nerves areoften
seen infresh tissue specimens that aren't treated
bydehydration and embedding.) The surface
tension ofanaxon hastobevery low, foritto
remain stable with such anextreme ratio of
surface tovolume: thediameter ofanaxon is
similar tothat ofabacteriun1. Ordinary water,
with itshigh surface tension, breaks upinto drops
rather than forming afilament. Ifsomething
increases thesurface tension ofanerve, ittends to
round up;theglial cells and Schwann cells that
surround theaxons offast-acting nerves provide
pregnenolone and progesterone totheaxon, and
theextreme lipophilicity ofprogesterone lowers
the surface tension ofcytoplasm. Progesterone
powerfully improves nerve cell regeneration.
During stress, cells runoutofoxygen andproduce
lactic acid instead ofcarbon dioxide, and the
lipophilic andacidic gasisreplaced bythehydro-
philic lactate.
Carbon dioxide protects nerves andmuscles
against excessive excitation. Itinhibits lactic acid
formation, andlipid peroxidation (measured inthe
blood) canbecompletely suppressed byapC02
ofabout 90mm, which isn't high enough to
produce acidosis.
Hospital respirators arenormally settohyper-
ventilate patients, and theuseofsupplemental
oxygen tends tomake hyperventilation worse,
making breathing and circulation more difficult.
Carbogen, 95% oxygen with 5%carbon dioxide,
isavailable, but isseldom used. Hyperbaric
oxygen isboth safer and more effective when
carbon dioxide isadded, buttheamount ofcarbon
dioxide needed varies with thepressure. More
people would recover from brain andspinal cord
injuries ifphysicians understood nerve andrespi-
ratory physiology.
One ofthe most commonly recognized
features ofestrogen excess isleakiness ofthe
capillaries. Simple hyperventilation isenough to
cause capillaries toleak, andthisinvolves many
related events, including decreased carbon
dioxide, and increased release ofserotonin.
Edema, fibrosis, andinflammation (resulting from
capillary leakage) contribute toachange incellu-
larenergy production, andalong with theactions
ofserotonin and other regulatory substances
released during thealkalosis ofstress, cells are
stimulated tomultiply.
The excitation ofcells produced by a
deficiency ofcarbon dioxide increases their need
for energy. Iftheir energy production is
suppressed (asbyestrogen, serotonin, andedema),
they willeither adapt or die.
Intheisolation ofadegenerating extracellular
matrix, with adefective energy supply, some cells
will react asthough they aregoing torepair a
wound orregenerate tissue, proliferating and
degrading the damaged matrix, butinstead of
encountering healthy tissue, they sometimes
encounter only more damaged tissue, and other
cells inthesimplified, proliferating state. Without
finding thestable field ofahealthy organism, they
willcontinue toadapt anddevelop, butwith refer-
ence toafield that hasnofunction. Eventually,
thatkind ofdisoriented adaptation canproduce a
malignant tumor.5
A1951 Symposium onSteroids inExperi-
mental andClinical Practice (held inCuemavaca),
edited byAbraham White, hasachapter byRoy
Hertz, etaI,"Observations ontheeffect ofproges-
terone oncarcinoma ofthecervix," that follows
upontheantitumorigenic effects ofprogesterone
discovered byLipschutz, andthechapter includes
some very interesting photographs ofcervical
tumors before and after treatment, and they
reported that"Ineleven ofthe17treated patients
visible andpalpable evidence ofregressive altera-
tion ofthetumor' mass could bedemonstrated.
This consisted of(a)distinct reduction insizeof
thevisible portion ofthecancer aswell asreduc-
tionofthepalpable extent ofthemass, (b)reduc-
tion invascularity and friability ofthevisible
lesion with aclearly demonstrable epithelization
ofpreviously raw surfaces and (c)markedly
increased pliability ofthepreviously rigid and
infiltrated parametria." [That is, the bloody
messes started healing, and the woody lumps
began tofeel like normal tissue.] Despite the
amazingly favorable results, they conclude "We
donotconsider theregressive changes observed
tobesufficient toindicate theuseofprogesteone
asatherapeutic agent incarcinoma ofthecervix."
This conclusion isespecially interesting, consider-
ingthattwopages later, Escher, eta1.,saythatthe
highly ambiguous effects ofestrogens onbreast
cancer "areofvalue toadvanced-cancer groups." I
think it'slikely thattheinstitutional sponsorship
ofthesymposium influenced those conclusions.
Hertz, eta1.,gave thewomen 250 mgof
progesterone in5mlofvegetable oili.m., usually
daily, fortento170days. They didn't mention any
side effects ofsedation oranesthesia. Hans Selye
found that large doses ofprogesterone caused
profound anesthesia inrats, but this effect has
never been reported inhumans, because the
pharmaceutical forms ofprogesterone don't
permit adequate doses. Using progesterone
dissolved intocopherol (at10% or20% concen-
tration), ittakes only 100mgtosemi-anesthetize
some people, andvery profound anesthesia canbe
produced bylarger doses. (In this form, avery
large dose cankillarat,though itstimulates the
respiratory center atlower anesthetic doses.)
Progesterone isbarely soluble inordinary
vegetable oils, and publications rarely mention
that theformulations which contain 250 mg/ml
also contain the"bacteriostat," benzyl alcohol,
which istheactual solvent, butwhich issosoluble
inwater thattheprogesterone crystallizes immedi-
ately after intramuscular injection. (Ihave previ-
ously written about the history ofmedical
progesterone, and the fraudulent claims and
doctrines thathave shaped itsuse.)
Although myobservations show that proges-
terone ismuch more effective intreating many
kinds ofcancer than most ofthepublished litera-
ture indicates, journal editors "know" otherwise.
When 1applied forthepatent ontheformulation
ofprogesterone invitamin E,thepatent examiner
toldmethat1must remove anymention ofcancer
if1wanted myapplication tobeapproved. The
"evil mutant cell" theory ofcancer, andtheofficial
description ofprogesterone asa"gestational
hormone" orprogestin, combine tocreate an
attitude thatdoesn't want tothink very long about
progesterone's general regulatory functions inthe
organism.
Synthetic "progestins" have some ofthe
properties ofprogesterone, andmany studies have
shown thatthey canbecurative when used against
several kinds ofcancer. Buttheprevailing cancer
culture hasledtotheir useincombination with
cytotoxic chemicals, and/or radiation, rather than
with thefactors that would really synergize with
their "progestational" actions: The factors that
would correct theformative, organismic field.
Since partofprogesterone's therapeutic action
isitsability toraise theconcentration ofcarbon
dioxide inthe tissues, other techniques that
increase carbon dioxide should beused atthe
same time. Thyroid's action iscrucial forthe
production ofcarbon dioxide, andfortheavoid-
ance oflactic acidosis, adrenalin excess, andother
processes thatlower carbon dioxide concentration.
(And, ofcourse, thyroid isessential forthesynthe-
sisofprogesterone, andforrestraining thesynthe-
sisofestrogen, and accelerating itselimination
from thebody.)
Progesterone, thyroid, andcarbon dioxide all
protect against thecancer-promoting actions of
calcium, andthey dothisbyincreasing respiratory6
energy, which favors intracellular magnesium
over calcium. Adequate magnesium inthedietis
extremely important. Itiscounterproductive toeat
acalcium-deficient diet, since that tends to
increase theintracellular calcium attheexpense of
calcium taken from thebones.
The immense power ofthepharmaceutical
industry, anditscontrolled government agencies,
creates asituation inwhich thework ofpeople
likeLipschutz andNeedham iswritten outofthe
culture. With theloss ofameaningful context,
individuals with anauthoritarian inclination will
believe that science consists ofcomparing the
latest therapeutic products ortechnologies with
theearlier products ortechnologies. Some ofthe
newer products andtechnologies will besold as
"alternative medicine," byadifferent branch of
industry. But ifthe newer alternatives still
conform totheview ofcancer andlifethat was
created toselltheoldproducts, they cannever
make arealdifference.

Among various nutrients, calcium isoneofthefewthat is
still deficient inindustrialized countries such asJapan and
many Western countries. Calcium deficiency isreadily
connected with osteoporosis, which isadecrease ofbone
calcium content. Less well known isthecalcium outflow
from bone. thatoccurs toprevent decrease ofblood calcium
incalcium deficiency caused bytheparathyroid hormone,
with consequent calcium overflow into softtissues andthe
intracellular compartment. Such intracellular paradoxical Ca
overload asaconsequence ofnutritional calcium deficiency
may give risetoanumber ofdiseases common inoldage:
hypertension, arteriosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, neurode-
generative diseases, malignancy, and degenerative joint
disease.

influx triggers thesequential proteolysis ofextracellular

ofbeta-catenin from cell-cell contacts. ItoK,Okamoto I,
Araki N,Kawano Y,Nakao M,Fujiyama S,Tomita K,
Mimori T,Saya H.Cadherins aremajor cell-cell adhesion
molecules inboth tumor andnormal tissues. Although serum
levels ofsoluble E-cadherin have been shown tobehigher in
thecancer patients than inhealthy volunteers, thedetail
mechanism regulating release ofsoluble E-cadherin remains
tobeelucidated. Here weshow that theectodomain of
E-cadherin isproteolytically cleaved from some cancer cells
byamembrane-bound metalloprotease toyield soluble form,
and theresidual membrane-tethered cleavage product is
subsequently degraded byintracellular proteolytic pathway.
Futhermore, weshow that extracellular calcium influx, that
isinduced bymechanical scraping ofcells orionomycin
treatment, enhances the metalloprotease-mediated8
E-cadherin cleavage andthesubsequent degradation ofthe
cytoplasmic domain. Immunocytochemical analysis demon-
strates thatthesequential proteolysis ofE-cadherin triggered
bythecalcium influx results intranslocation ofbeta-catenin
from thecell-cell contacts tocytoplasm. Our data suggest
that calcium influx-induced proteolysis ofE-cadherin not
only disrupts thecell-cell adhesion butalso activates beta-
catenin-mediated intracellular signaling pathway, potentially
leading toalterations inmotility andproliferation activity of
cells.

Progestins and cancer. Sitruk-Ware R,Plu-Bureau G.
"Progestins exert different effects according tothe
steroid from which they are derived, e.g. pregnanes
derived from progesterone, estranes orgonanes derived
from testosterone. Some estrane derivatives areable to
stimulate breast cellmultiplication invitro through anestro-
gen receptor-mediated pathway. Most pregnanes donot
exert such aneffect. Also, some pregnane derivatives stimu-
late apoptosis, leading tocell death. However, itiswell
established thathigh doses ofprogestins have been success-
fully used inthetreatment ofadvanced breast cancer as
second-line endocrine therapy. Finally, striking differences
have been observed inprogestin useinEurope and inthe
USA. InFrance, where the rate ofprogestin use per
/lead ishigher than intheUSA, therate ofbreast cancer
has not increased assharply asobserved inNorth
America. Although cancer genesis ismultifactorial, itmay
beconcluded that progestins doprotect endometrial tissue
against theproliferative action ofestrogen andifthey donot
protect breast tissue, atleast they donotstimulate itsprolif- .
eration. Also, they areuseful agents asasecond-line therapy
forbreast cancer, when used athigh doses."
