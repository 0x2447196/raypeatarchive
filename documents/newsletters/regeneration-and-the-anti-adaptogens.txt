Idon't think aging isnecessary, andIthink I
have begun toseetheorganism inacontext that
canexplain thecause ofaging inarelatively simple
way.

Every important issue inlifeisanopportunity
fQrpowerful self-interest tointervene and take
control. Intransportation,' corporations interested
inselling gasoline and cars destroyed thecities'
elegant systems ofelectric trolleys, inenergy the
nuclear andpetroleum interests fought thedevel-
opment ofsolar andwind power, andthetimber
industry lobbies against innovation inhouse con-
struction. The issue ofaging anddeath isonethat
hasbeen consciously dealt with throughout human
existence, andithasaccumulated amost complex
system ofmental commitments. This investmentofemotion andbelief affects every aspect ofthe-
oryand practice inbiology and medicine. We
have tokeep asking "isthis researcher ignoring
some facts that might seem toconflict with his
ideology?"
Previously, Ihave talked about thedoctrine
thatourcells aredivided intotheimmortal cells of
"the germ line," andthemortal "somatic" cells of
alltherestofthebody. This doctrine says "people
aremortal, sotheir cells must beintrinsically mor-
tal,butthey canhave descendants adinfinitum, so
their germ cells must bedifferent from alltherest
oftheir cells, andimmortal." Alexis Carrel was fa-
mous fordemonstrating that heart cells could be
immortal intheright environment, buthiswork is
now ignored ordismissed. "Only cancer cells and
thegerm lineareimmortal," thepresent doctrine
says; ("and maybe embryonic cells"). Itseems that
theimmortalization ofourmortal somatic cells is
acceptable, aslong asthese cells have thefunction
ofkilling us.
Ithink some ofCarrel's ideas about thenature
ofliving organization andofaging areworth quot-
ing. (Man theUnknown, 1935.)
"Isolated cells have the singular power of
reproducing ...theedifices characterizing each or-
gan, Ifafew redcorpuscles, impelled bygravity,
flow from adrop ofblood placed inliquid plasma
and form atiny stream, banks aresoon built up.
Then, these banks cover themselves with filaments
offibrin, andthestream becomes apipe, through
which theredcells glide just asinablood vessel.
Next, leucocytes come, adhere tothesurface of
thepipe, and surround itwith their undulating
membrane. The blood stream now assumes the
appearance ofacapillary vessel enveloped in a.
layer of cells. Thus, isolated redand
white corpuscles manage toconstruct asegment
ofcirculatory apparatus, although there isneither
heart, circulation, nor tissues tobeirrigated."
"The spontaneous tendency toward formation of
.theorgans bytheir constitutive cells, likethesocial
aptitude oftheinsects, isaprimary datum ofob-
servation." (page 107.)
"The simplest system, where thephenomenon
ofsensescence isobserved, consists ofagroup of
tissue cells cultivated inasmall volume ofnutritive
medium. Insuch asystem, themedium isprogres-
sively modified bytheproducts ofnutrition and, in
itsturn, modifies thecells. Then appear senes-
cence anddeath. Therhythm ofphysiological time
depends ontherelations between thetissues and
their medium. Itvaries according tothevolume,
themetabolic activity, thenature ofthecellcol-
ony, andthequantity and thechemical composi-
tion ofthe fluid and gaseous media. .The
technique used in the preparation ofacultureaccounts fortherhythm oflifeofsuch culture.
Forexample, afragment ofheart fedwith asingle
drop ofplasma intheconfined atmosphere ofa
hollow slide, andanother oneimmersed inaflask
containing alarge volume ofnutritive fluids and
gases, have quite different fates. The rate ofaccu-
mulation ofthewaste products inthemedium, and
thenature ofthese products, determine thecharac-
teristics oftheduration ofthetissues. When the
composition ofthemedium ismaintained constant,
thecell colonies remain indefinitely inthesame
state ofactivity." "If,byanappropriate technique,
their volume isprevented from increasing, they
never grow old. Colonies obtained from aheart
fragment removed inJanuary, 1912, from achick
embryo, aregrowing asactively today astwenty-
three years ago. Infact, they areimmortal." (Page
173.)
Heart cells arerecognizable even inisolation,
because they beat. Itwould beimpossible tomis-
take them foranother type ofcell.
.Years later, Hans Selye was observing there-
action toasmall glass tube inserted under arat's
skin. Henoticed thatthetube was soon enclosed
byacapsule offibrous tissue, and that thecells
gradually grew inastrand from theends down the
channel ofthetube. These cells were isolated
from thefluids that normally surround cells, and
Selye found that after ashort time they took on
theappearance ofcells from avery oldanimal,
while thecells ofthe surrounding capsule re-
mained normal. Selye drained theflui1 atinter-
vals, allowing ittobereplaced byfresh fluid, and
found thatattheendoftherat's life-span, thecells
ofthisfilament showed nosigns ofaging.
Carrel's work with tissue-culture ledhimtobe-
lieve that changes intheorganism's fluids were a
major part oftheaging process. Extracts from
animal embryos have been used medically for
treating oldpeople, because oftheir confirmed ef-
fect oncellfunction. "Blood plasma alone dis-
plays, throughout theeptire life-time, progressive
modifications characterizing thesenescence ofthe
body asawhole. Weknow thatitcontains these-
cretions ofalltissues andorgans. Plasma andtis-
sues being aclosed system, anyalteration inthe
tissues reacts ontheplasma, andvice versa. Dur-
ing the course oflife, this system undergoes
continuous changes. Some ofthese changes may
bedetected both bychemical analysis and by
physiological reactions. The plasma ortheserum
ofanaging animal hasbeen found toincrease its
restraining effect onthegrowth ofcell colonies.
The ratio ofthearea ofacolony living inserum, to
that ofanidentical colony living inasaline solu-
tion and acting asacontrol, iscalled thegrowth
index. The older theanimal towhich theserum
belongs, thesmaller isthis index." "During the
first days oflife, blood serum does notinhibit the
growth ofcell colonies any more than does the
control solution. Atthis moment thevalue ofthis
index approaches unity. As theanimal becomes
older, itsserum restrains cell multiplication more
effectively. And index decreases. During the
last years oflife, itisgenerally equal tozero."
{Page 168.)
In1921, aresearcher (A.1.Lotka) looking for
ajob attheRockefeller Institute visited Carrel's
laboratory. "Isaw ayoung lady making chicken
hash inthemost heartless butthoroughly scientific
manner. Isaw alittle piece ofchicken heart fool-
ishly throbbing after alloccasion forthrobs had
long ceased. Isaw athirteen year olddog reju-
ventated bytheinfusion ofyounger blood. Itwas
hardly converted into agiddy young thing, but
they told methere was still marked· improvement
even after twelve months." (S.E.Kingsland, Mod-
eling Nature, Univ. ofChicago Press, 1995.)
Carrel discussed Lecomte duNouy's equations
fordescribing ¢eregenerative activity ofthebody
atagiven age. (A21year-old person heals twice
asquickly asa40year-old person.) The rate of
healing andthegrowth index ofplasma, according
toCarrel, "•••correspond tosuccessive states in
the chemical composition ofthe humors. The
proteins ofblood serum become more. abun-
dant and their characters are modified. Itis
chiefly thefats which give toserum theprop-
erty ofacting upon certain ceO types and ofdi-
minishing the rapidity oftheir multiplication.
These fats increase inquantity and change in
nature during life." (Page 174.)
Here, Iwant toreview some oftheeffects of
fats that Ihave talked about elsewhere. Polez-
haev's work inregeneration hassuggested that the
fatty residue leftfrom degenerating cells stimulatestheformation ofnew cells. Linoleic acid, like
phorbol esters and estrogen, activates protein
C,andthecellgrowth system.
Inlooking atatissue slide that was used todi-
agnose "ductal carcinoma insitu," Inoticed that
thestructures resembled cross-sections oftuber-
cles. Inthebreast ducts, fatty residues from milk
secretions should beable tostimulate celldivision.
The fats formed bythetuberculosis bacillus stimu-
latethecellular reaction that produces thetubercle
structure. Since atuberculous breast grossly re-
sembles acancerous breast, itisimportant that the
possible structural similarity ofthetwo diseases,
under themicroscope, beconsidered. The bacteria
candisappear from thecells inatubercle, and the
"defining" presence ofgiant cells inthetubercular
lesion isn't invariable.)
Ithasbeen suggested that thetubercle devel-
opsandpersists because thebody's proteolytic en-
zymes areinhibited bytheunsaturated fats. (Even
older ideas of"fatty degeneration," going back to
thevery beginnings. ofbiochemistry, were based
onthefact that proteins aredeposited from solu-
tion ataninterface, such asthat formed byadrop
ofoil,forming asortofproteinaceous skin around
fatdroplets.) Whether theprocess issimply .the
result ofinactivating proteolytic enzymes, orthe
result ofamore specific disordering ofcellcontrol
systems, itisawell established experimental fact
that oils stimulate akind offibrous tumor, called
the"oil granuloma. Iftheoilcan't bedigested
andremoved, thebody reacts byforming, agrowth
around it.Inside thecell, unsatura.ted fatty acids
slow many cellular processes, including respiratory
energy production and protein turnover, changes
which parallel thechanges occurring inaging.
About 30years ago, Leonard Haytlick found
that certain animal orhuman cells which can be
grown inadish would dieoutafter about 50divi-
sions. Healso found that cells from oldindividu-
alswould stop dividing sooner when grown in
tissue culture. Heannounced that thislimited abil-
itytodivide sets themaximum limit ofthelifespan.
Hehassaid that this isgoverned bytheprinciple
that entropy tends toincrease. Another group.-
found that thesame kind ofcell continued todi-
vide nicely after 110divisions, and didn't begin to

radically different tissue types (hair, teeth, bones,
fingernails, mammary tissue, e.g.) inaninappro-
priate location-often theovary, butsometimes in
the &ladder, tongue, rectum orother location.
These have been explained as"embryonic rests,"
orundeveloped Siamese twins, asaway toavoid
theidea thatsomatic cells have thecapacity tore-
vert tototipotency. Their occurrence isstrongly
reminiscent ofthesituation inplants, inwhich an
injured (isolated) somatic cell becomes "totipo-
tent," resembling agerm cellorembryonic cell.
Ifcells have systems that regulate their func-
tions, andknown substances distrupt those func-
tions, theendogenous regulatory material must
have some oftheproperties ofthedisruptive ma-
terial. Forexample, digitalis andouabain areplant
steroid-derivatives that arepoisonous toanimal
ceIls--especiaily the heart cells--by acting ata
"site" which isnormally regulated bysubstances
such asDHEA andprogesterone. __
Forplants, cholesterol isahormone, while itis
only a"precursor forhormones inanimals. If
plants ateanimals, they might eventually accumu-
late enough cholesterol todisrupt theprocesses
normally regulated bytheir very small amounts of
cholesterol.
The factthat opium from poppies, similar
substances found inother- plants, have apowerful
effect onanimals, and can befound associated
with certain sites intheir cells, ledtothebelief that
these were regulatory sites, thatmight normally be
controlled byvery small amounts of pro-
dliced intheanimals' tissues, fOTregulatory pur-
poses. This ledtothediscovery oftheendorphins,
.the peptide molecules that have morphine-like
effects.
Valium (orthetraditional valerian root ex- ;\
tract) was found tobeassociat' '.
"receptor site," which isnow known asthe"ben- \
zodlazepme peptide called "en-
ozepme lot enatural regulators ofthat,..-"
control system, butitisalso influenced byGABf
(gamma amino butyric acid), progesterone,
pregnenolone, and other materials. Butyric acid
itself might affect thissystem.
Marihuana acts oncells byacting atasitethat
iscalled the"cannabinoid receptor," because thedieoutuntil they began tousetheserum from a
different calf Their result resembled Carrel's find-
ings, inwhich thefluid from younger organisms
supported more vigorous growth intissue culture,
and clearly casts doubt onHayflick's principle.
Buteven without such contradictions ofHayflick's
tissue culture results, Hayflick's claims couldn't
really" betaken seriously asanything butatheoreti-
calmodel ofwhat ishappening tocells inanaging
organism, because cells that areremoved from
their complex environment intheorganism have
been deprived ofarich and communicative
framework. "
The cells oftheskin andbowel divide thou-
sands oftimes inanormal lifetime, showing that
there isakind ofarrogant silliness intheclaim that
"human cells have astrictly limited capacity todi-
vide." (Icallthis"disproof bydandruff ")
Pieces ofskin ormammary gland, removed
from oldratsandtransplanted into young rats, re-
mained healthy through thelifetimes oftenanimals
inseries. When young animals have been surgi-
cally attached tooldanimals ("parabiosis"), the
pairhaslived out life-span oftheyounger ani-
mal, allowing theolder onetoreach anabnormally
advanced age. Insome studies, beneficial changes
have been seen intheoldindividual, and some
harmful effects appeared intheyoung animal. I
have described these experiments previously.
Selye's experiment, besides showing theimpor-
tance offluid renewal incellaging, also showed
oneoftheways inwhich cells respond tostruc-
tUre. Cells build structures; andthen they respond
tothem. They "know" where they areinagiven
structure. Cells produce materials--some ofthem
soluble, others insoluble--that produce acharacter-
istic local environment. Inplants, theceliulose
scaffolding between cells, andother extracellular
matrix materials, serve aspart oftheinformation
that guides thefunctioning ofcells,1 sothat re-
moval ofthecellulose allows thecelltostop aspe-
cialized function, andbegin togrow andtake on
new functions, even insome cases producing a
complete new organism. Inawound inananimal's
skin, celldivision isstimulated toheal thewound.

body's natural regulator acting onthat siteisn't yet The organization oflifeismaintained bythe
known.
The unsaturated fatty acids, linolenic acid and
linoleic acid, produced byplants, interfere with in-
tercellular communication,2aswell asintracellular
regulatory sites. (pKC, osmotic balance3,respira-
tion.) The body's natural regulatory materials are
probably similar instructure, butproduced incon-
trolled amounts andlocations.
The Mead acids are unsaturated fatty acids
produced insmall quantities bythebody when the'
diet doesn't contain anoverwhelming amount of
theplant-derived fatty acids. Wherever theplant
fats act, wecan. expect tofind aprocess that is
regulated bytheMead acids, though notnecessar-
ilyinthesame way orwith the.same result. Even
ifthematerials had'thesame effect onthecontrol
system, the'increasing accumulation ofanactive
material willtend tomake control impossible, act-
ingasaconstant. signal toactivate thesystem.
(Therefore, even anexaggerated accumulation of
thenatural transmitter substance would bedisrup-
tive ifitwere released inanuncontrolled way.
The regulatory substance ideally would not be
stored inexcess, oritwould bereleased inacon-
trolled way. The Mead acids seem tomeet these
criteria.) [The position ofthecertain type offatty
acid onglyceroi, for example, isregulated byspe-
cific enzymes. J .
Anaturally occurring combination ofafatty
acid with ethanolamine, called anandamide, acti-
vates the"marihuana receptor" ofcells. Itpre-
vents some types ofcell activation. The Mead
acid ethanolarnide, likethearachidonic acid form,
canbeenzymatically formed invarious human tis-
sues, such asthehippocampus, butthetwo sub:'
stances have slightly different effects. Marihuana's
anticonvulsant properties might bemore effec-
tively represented bytheMead acid derivative.
Theanti-excitatory effect might also beeffective in
preventing theloss ofcells inthehippocampus,
hypothalamus, and other brain regions, which
(building onOlney's work 25years ago) isincreas-
ingly understood toresult from excitotoxicity.
The architecture oftissues interacts with the
cytoskeleton andthenuclear scaffolding todefine
thepossibilities andopportunities that areavailable
tothecellandtotheorganism.energy ituses, and theuseofenergy requires a
specific organization. There areprocesses incells
that regulate theinteractions ofgrowth, division
and other functions, butthese processes arere-
sponsive tothecells' environment--they aren't just
"emitted by"or"unrolled from" thecells' reper-
toire ofabilities.
The cell's structure has sensitive "leverage"
points that serve forpurposes of"perception" or
"signalling." When organization fails, itisjustrea-
sonable toconsider whether extraneous conditions
or"signals" have intervened. Ifitwere inlife's na-
ture tobecome disorganized, itishard toimagine
that itwould persist and
