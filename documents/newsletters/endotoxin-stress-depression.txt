Endotoxin, stress, depression:
Serotonin, starches, fatty acids, and
antidotes
Increasingly, intestinal serotonin isbeing
recognized asafactor inosteoporosis, migraine,
irritable bowel syndrome, appendicitis, and
cancer. From ancient times until about 100years
ago, thebowel had avery important place in
medical practice, with purgatives and enemas
being recommended for headaches, persistent
coughs, seizures, and many chronic diseases.
Pavlov stUdied thedigestive system asaway to
understand themind, because it'swhere weinter-
actmost closely with theenvironment.
Up toPavlov's time, traditional medicine
thought interms ofachieving balance inthe
organism, using metaphors such asthe four
humors (phlegm, blood, yellow bile and black
bile) andthefour personality types---phlegmatic,
sanguine, choleric, andmelancholic.
Inwestern Europe andtheUSduring the19th
century, divisions inmedical doctrine began to
appear between traditional, "empirical" practitio-
ners andadvocates ofanew "rational," reduction-
istallopathic doctrine who were coming tobelieve
thatdisea-seilad its-origin incells andtheir defects
ofform orfunction. These "scientific physicians"
began amajor propaganda campaign toridicule
blood-letting and purging asexamples ofthe
unscientific practices oftheir competitors. The
idea ofinternal toxins itself was ridiculed. A
gastroenterology professor (Walter C.Alvarez)
used hisnewspaper column toargue against the
oldideas, forexample that toxins absorbed from
the intestine caused headaches. He described
putting wads ofcotton into therectums ofhis
medical students, and aconsiderable number of
them developed headaches while thecotton wasinplace. That, heasserted, disproved theidea that
absorbed toxins were thecause ofheadaches. It
didn't really dispfDve anything, butitcontributed
totheculture that was discouraging theuseof
laxatives. Russian researchers, who were still
working inPavlov's holistic tradition, foundÂ· that
inflating aballoon inananimal's intestine didn't
have anyobservable effect inanormal animal but,
when theanimal's blood sugar was lowered, the
stretching oftheintestine would produce awide
range ofsymptoms, from asthma toseizures. Itis
likely that some ofAlvarez'S students had low
blood glucose, and were more susceptible than
others totheabnormal stretching oftherectum.
Inflammation ofthebowel used toberecorded
frequently asthecause ofdeath ofolder people,
butnow it'sseldom mentioned inautopsy reports
asthecause ofdeath, ifit'smentioned atall.
Hans Selye had noticed that intestinal bleed-
ingwas astandard feature ofbeing sick, and it
became adefining feature ofhisconcept ofstress.
Oldpeople sometimes getulcers intheir colon or
rectum, adjacent tolumps ofhardened fecal
material. Selye devised animal experiments, in
which heshowed that aninterference with blood
circulation that normally didn't produce serious
ha..rrn, would cause similar (stercorall ulcers, and
also paralysis ofthehind legs, ifheinjected
serotonin into theanimal. If theanti-serotonin
drug, cyproheptadine, was given totheanimal
before theserotonin, they were protected. The
ulcers required the combination ofrestricted
blood circulation, excess serotonin, and the
presence offeces inthelower intestine. Without
the serotonin, the other two factors failed to
produce theulcers (1966). Inaprevious experi-
ment, hehad demonstrated that thecombination
ofimpaired circulation with serotonin would
cause severe muscular dystrophy (1965).
Selye's research group showed how closely the
digestive system andthenervous system interact,
butthey didn't govery farinexploring theeffects
ofdietonthenervous system.
Just friction, orscratching orstretching the
intestine isenough tocause ittorelease serotonin
into the bloodstream. Serotonin increases the
permeability oftheintestine and blood vessels,
andsoislikely tobeamajor cause oftheabsorp-
tion ofendotoxin (and other harmful material)
during intestinal irritation orstress. Thebiological
meaning ofserotonin might bevery different
without endotoxin, but that hasn't been
investigated.
Bacterial endotoxin increases serotonin release
from t.heintestine, and increases itssynthesis in
thebrain (Nolan, etal.,2000) and liver (Bndo,
1983). It also stimulates itsrelease from platelets,
and reduces thelungs' ability todestroy it.The
formation ofserotonin inthe intestine isalso
stimulated bythelactate, propionate andbutyrate
that areformed bybacteria fermenting fiber and
starch, butthese bacteria also produce endotoxin.
The inflammation-producing effects oflactate,
serotonin, and endotoxin are overlapping,
additive, and sometimes synergistic, along with
histamine, nitric oxide, bradykinin, and the
cytokines.
There have been some studies showing that
bacterial fermentation intheintestine can cause
many symptoms, including behavioral changes.
For example, adiet ofsoyprotein increases
aggression inmonkeys (Simon, etal.,2004) and
chickens (McKeegan, etal.,2001).
When various fermentable carbohydrates were
fedtorats, they became anxious and agi"essive,
andthese changes inbehavior corresponded tothe
fermentation ofthese materials bybacteria inthe
lower intestine, with theproduction oflactic acid
(Hanstock, etal.,2003, 2004).
Dietary fiber has been promoted foralong
time, and for many reasons---John Harvey
Kellogg argued that itprevented dirty thoughts,
thecholesterol people argued that itwould lower
cholesterol, Denis Burkitt, inthe1970s, suggested
that itcould prevent colon cancer. When Burkitt
visited theUSand saw that oatbran was being
recommended, hecommented that themain fiber2
intheAfrican diethehadstudied was potato. By
the1980s, studies inanimals were showing that
some kinds offiber, including oatbran, pectin,
corn bran, metamucil, undegraded
carrageenan, agar, psyllium, goar gum, and
alfalfa, were carcinogenic, increasing the
incidence ofcolon cancer, and possibly ovarian
and breast cancer (Toth, 1984, Jacobs, 1986,
Goodman, etal.,2002).
Many advocates ofincreasing dietary fiber
argue that butyric acid isaprotective factor
produced bybacterial decomposition ofstarch and
fiber, and itdoes (atleast invitro) sometimes
cause cancer cells todifferentiate into normal
cells. However, itaccelerates thegrowth ofintes-
tinal cells, andwhen that iscombined with toxins
itmight actasatumor promoter. The lactic acid
produced bybacteria andbytheinflamed intestine
itself isnow recognized asanimportant factor in
thedevelopment ofcancer.
The upper partofthesmall intestine issterile
inhealthy people. ill thelast40years, there has
been increasing interest inthe "contaminated
small-bowel syndrome," orthe "small intestine
bacterial overgrowth syndrome." When peristalsis
isreduced, forexample byhypothyroidism, along
with reduced secretion ofdigestive fluids, bacteria
areable tothrive intheupper partoftheintestine.
Sugars arevery quickly absorbed intheupper
intestine, sostarches and fibers normally provide
most ofthenourishment forbowel bacteria.
Besides avoiding gums and other "soluble
fiber," and starches that aren't quickly digested,
there areseveral things that canprotect against the
toxic effects ofbacterial degradation products.
Beans arefumous fortheir gas-producing polysac-
charides, butallgrains and vegetables and firm
under-ripe fruits contain starches that resist our
digestive enzymes, butthat canprovide food for
bacteria. Undercooked starch, and starches
combined with enzyme inhibitors (including
polyunsaturated fats), tend tobefermented by
bacteria. Ne'Y technology inthe orange juice
industry has converted normal pulp tosoluble
fiber thatsupports bacterial fermentation.
Ahigh ratio ofcalcium tophosphorus reduces
the breakdown offibers, and this probably
contributes tosome oftheprotective effects ofa\
large amount ofcalcium inthediet, forexample
reduction intheincidence ofbowel and ovarian
cancer.
Afew plant fibers have ahigh proportion of
cellulose, that resists bacterial attack, combined
with antibiotics that suppress bacterial growth, but
inmost grains and vegetables, and many fruits,
cellulose iscombined with fibers that support
bacterial growth. Fats, especially saturated fatty
acids, have antiseptic properties, and when they
arecombined with starches andfibers they help to
suppress bacterial growth. Their effects can be
seen invarious ways, including protection against
the anxiety caused byfermentation (Prasad and
Prasad, 1996).
.Thyroid hormone digestive activity,
including stomach acid and peristalsis, and both
thyroid andprogesterone increase theability ofthe
intestine toabsorb sugars quickly; their deficiency
can permit bacteria tolive onsugars aswell as
starches.
Pavlov's and Anokhin's understanding ofthe
organism interms ofitsintegration ofperceptions
oftheactual situation, including itsneeds, andits
projection ofthepossibility ofsatisfying those
needs, gives usaway tounderstand some ofthe
ways that ourdigestive system interacts with our
physical health and our moods and emotions.
Anokhin, inanalyzing Pavlov's Reflex ofPurpose
andExploratory Reflex, described theway that the
cortex ofthebrain creates amodel oftheworld,
including information about thepresent state of
theorganism. Anokhin called this model ofthe
situation theAcceptor ofAction, because itwas
theframework forevaluating behavior. Aproperly
functIoning organism isalways proJecting Or
imagining future possible situations, and project-
ing orimagining itsactions inthose situations,
evaluating thepossibilities.
Any particular external situation can create
stress ornot, depending onwhat itmeans tothe
individual. The perception ofapossibly good
outcome mobilizes thecreative adaptive abilities,
inafunctional system that includes anexternal
goal and relevant physiological processes; the
failure tosee possibility inthe situation--
anticipating failure rather than success--
demobilizes the systems ofadaptation, and the3
excitation caused byunsatisfied needs produces
generalized catabolic processes.
As the organism prepares toenact these
imagined possible futures, itmobilizes theappro-
priate resources, activating some systems and
inactivating other systems, constructing, consum-
ing and redistributing itsown substance, while
assimilating substances from the environment.
The anabolic hormones, such asthyroid, and the
tissue-catabolic hormones such ascortisol, act
both locally and systemically, according to
various regulatory processes, mainly nervous
processes. Afunctional system iscreated for
achieving thegoaL Astheorganism achieves its
purposes oradapts, thecatabolic hormones will
subside .
Sensory nerves intheintestine contribute to
the organism's assessment ofthe situation--the
Acceptor ofAction--and motor nerves adjust the
state oftheintestine and other organs. The inter-
play between the state ofthe intestine and the
assessed state ofthestressful situation determines
whether theindividual will withdraw (often with
incontinence ofthebowel and bladdet) orpersist
andstruggle toadapt.
Defensive aggression isprobably aresponse
intermediate between fearful giv.ing upandconfi-
dent achievement. When aratisrestrained, held
down onitsback, itquickly develops ulcers, butif
ithas astick tobite, itisvery resistant tothe
formation ofthe ulcers. The ability todo
something with adefensive meaning prevents the
excessive production ofserotonin and itsconse-
quences, such asincreased production ofcortisol
and other stress hormones, and disturbance of
citulation ancl energy production-:-Encrotoxirr and
prostaglandins activate these same systems, and
progesterone andaspirin areamong theprotective
factors that canoppose those effects.
When physical andmental activity areintensi-
fied tomeet anadaptive crisis, the adrenergic
sympathetic nervous system optimizes muscular
energy production, but inhibits the digestive
system. In the state of anxious-helpless
withdrawal, theparasympathetic and serotonergic
systems demobilize the active neuro-
skeletomuscular systems, andactivate thebladder,
intestine and stomach, tending toempty the
contents bycausing diarrhea, vomiting, andurina-
tion. Serotonin reduces energy production in
muscles; this isprobably related tothemuscular
dystrophy itproduced inSelye's experiments, and
themyopathy produced bytryptophan (Castot, et
aI., 1991). Antiserotonin drugs are used for
controlling diarrhea and vomiting, and some of
them areprotective against ulcers (Ramesh, etaI.,
2009).
Chronically elevated cortisol iscommonly
seen indepressed people, butgiving asupplement
ofcortisol iseffective inrelieving depression.
Both cortisol and the pituitary corticotropic
hormone that stimulates itsproduction, ACTH,
have some antidepressant effects, andthey inhibit
thehypothalamic corticotropin release honnone,
CRR. CRR ismore directly associated with
depression than cortisol is,and itbyitself
activates many inflammatory processes, including
the release ofhistamine, cytokines, and nitric
oxide. CRR ispromoted inthehypothalamus (and
in many other tissues) by inflamriI.ation,
endotoxin, serotonin, interleukins, and prosta-
glandins, butalso bytheperception ofunavoid-
able difficulties.
Besides cortisol, progesterone and androgens
areinternal factors that decrease theactivity of
CRR. Estrogen and hypothyroidism increase its
activity.
The convergence, interaction, andsummation
ofinflammatory molecules with the perceived
meaning ofasituation isasubject carefully
avoided bythose. who think oftheorganism asa
sum ofitsmolecules and cells. They accept that
transmitter molecules and receptor molecules
regulate behavior, and inftuenceperception, but
they can't explain how understanding andinterpre-
tation can make the profound differencesÂ· in
.feeling, behavior, and biochemistry that they in
factdomake.
The model ofnerves ason-off switches,
governed bythestate oftheir membrane, has
made theproblem ofintegrating meaning with
chemistry seem impossibly complex. Inrecent
years ithas been recognized that nerves can
produce orrespond tomore than one kind of
signal, butfewpeople have understood nerve cells
inaway that could allow individual cells to4
handle complex and subtle signals, and tomake
rational judgments based onsuch signals. P.K.
Anokhin, G.Albrecht-Buehler and afew others
have observed the importance ofrecognizing
cellular complexity, and theability ofcells to
integrate complex information. The cell physiol-
ogy ofGilbert Ling and Albert Szent-Gyorgyi
demonstrated thebasis onwhich these complex
integrating processes canbeunderstood.
Nerves andmuscle cells should beconsidered
together, because they respond tomany things in
similar ways. The membrane people don't like to
think that nerves have anycontractile properties,
but infact they do tWitch slightly when
stimulated, showing that itistheentire cytoplasm
that responds toinformation, notthehypothetical
plasma membrane. When they areoverstimulated,
they swell, asmuscles dowhen they arefatigued.
When amuscle isstretched while it'strying to
contract (asinrunning downhill; this iscalled
"eccentric contraction") itbecomes inflamed, and
the structural damage can becumulative. By
exercising muscles with "concentric contractions,"
allowing them toshorten against resistance, the
cellular damage canberepaired.
Stretching anerve causes some metabolic
changes similar tothemuscle ineccentric contrac-
tion, butnerves arenormally protected against
injuries ofthat sort. However, intense stimu-
lation ofanerve fiber can disrupt itsinternal
structure, causing "beading," an intermittent
clumping ofthenerve filaments andmicrotubules
along the axon, asifthe internal structure is
contractmg insegments, while theoverall axon
doesn't contract. With intense stress, thebeaded
fiber can separate into individual pieces, like
droplets ofcytoplasm, instead oftheelongated
cylinder. Long before stress causes ittodisinte-
grate inthatmanner, itislikely thatitcauses itto
lose itsfunctional coherence.
The excessive stimulation ofacell increases
itsinternal alkalinity, causing ittotake upmore
water. The mediators ofinflammation, such as
CRR, serotonin,Â· and endotoxin cause cell
swelling and increased alkalinity. CRR and
endotoxin can increase the susceptibility to
seizures, butthey can also block theability of
cells torespond tonormal stimulation.

Serotonin, asanalkaloid, isbound andinacti-
vated byacidic cells. Carbon dioxide, produced by
respiration, normally keeps cells slightly acidic.
Hyperventilation, ortheproduction ofless carbon
dioxide and more lactic acid, causes serotonin to
bereleased from platelets andother cells where it
hasbeen inactive, allowing ittoenter other cells
where ithas itscharacteristic effects, increasing
lactate, decreasing ATP (Assouline-Cohen, etai.
1998, Koren-Schwartzer, etaI.,1994), increasing
pH,andstimulating contraction ormitosis.
One ofthe very neglected mechanisms of
serotonin's action isitsability toactivate carbonic
anhydrase, aclass ofenzymes that convert carbon
dioxide to bicarbonate, and tend toincrease the
alkalinity of cells. Inhibitors of carbonic
anhydrase arecurrently being investigate fortheir
ability tostop thegrowth ofcancer cells and to
permit their recovery ofnormal functions. One of
thecarbonic anhydrase inhibitors, acetazolamide,
has been used formany years totreat epilepsy,
glaucoma, migraine, sleep apnea, mountain
sickness--and even psychosis (Inoue, etaI.,1984).
Serotonin's effects appear tobetheresult ofits
action onthemicrotubules orother elements of
thecell skeleton (Bianchi, etaI.,2003, Grass, et
aI.,2004), which arethemain integrating elements
ofthecell. Chronic disturbance ofthemicrotu-
buIes and neurofilaments, with inflammation and
impaired energy production, ischaracteristic of
Alzheimer's disease.
Iftheinternal and external causes ofstress
converge, additively, onthecell's internal commu-
nication and integration system, then the basic
resistance ofthe organism tostress can be
increased byanyofthefactors which oppose the
signals ofstress.
Carbon dioxide, progesterone, andthyroid act
onmany ofthe factors that interfere with our
ability tohandle stress constructively. Adiet that
reduces fermentation and "endotoxin, with an
abundance ofcalcium--fruit, milk, andcheese, for
example--can help toshift thebalance away from
lactic acid, estrogen, andserotonin, toward carbon
dioxide, progesterone, andthyroid.REFERENCES
