Mary Shomon interview
Mary Shomon: Why dowomen with treated
hypothyroidism frequently still have inappropri-
ately high levels ofcholesterol and high triglyc-
erides, andwhat canthey dotohelp lower these
levels?
RP: Often it's because they were given
thyroxine, instead oftheactive thyroid hormone,
but hypertriglyceridemia can becaused bya
variety of things that interact with
hypothyroidism. Estrogen treatment isacommon
cause ofhigh triglycerides, and deficiencies of
magnesium, copper, andprotein cancontribute to
that abnormality. Toxins, including some drugs
and herbs, can irritate orstimulate theliver to
produce too much triglyceride. D, triiodothy-
ronine, istheactive thyroid hormone, and itis
produced (mainly intheliver) from thyroxine, and
thefemale liver islessefficient than themale liver
inproducing it,asisthefemale thyroid gland. The
thyroid gland, which normally produces some T3,
will decrease itsproduction inthepresence of
increased thyroxine. Therefore, thyroxine often
acts asa"thyroid anti-hormone," especially in
women. When thyroxine was tested inhealthy
young male medical students, itseemed to
function "just like thethyroid hormone," butin
people who are seriously hypothyroid, itcan
suppress their oxidative metabolism even more.
It'savery common, butvery serious, mistake to
callthyroxine "the thyroid hormone."High cholesterol ismore closely connected to
hypothyroidism than hypertriglyceridemia is.
Increased T3 will immediately increase the
conversion ofcholesterol toprogesterone andbile
acids. When people have abnormally low choles-
terol, Ithink it'simportant toincrease their
cholesterol before taking thyroid, since their
steroid-forming tissues won't beable torespond
properly tothyroid without adequate cholesterol.
MS: You feelthatprogesterone canhave anti-
stress effects, without harming theadrenal glands.
Isprogesterone therapy something you feel is
useful tomany ormost hypothyroid patients?
How can apatient know ifshe needs
progesterone? Doyou recommend blood tests?
And ifso,atwhat point inawoman's cycle?
RP: Estrogen blocks therelease ofhormone
from thethyroid gland, and progesterone facili-
tates therelease. Estrogen excess orprogesterone
deficiency tends tocause enlargement ofthe
thyroid gland, inassociation with ahypothyroid
state. Estrogen can activate the adrenals to
produce cortisol, leading tovarious harmful
effects, including brain aging and bone loss.
Progesterone stimulates the adrenals and the
ovaries toproduce more progesterone, butsince
progesterone protects against thecatabolic effects
ofcortisol, itseffects aretheopposite ofestro-
gen's. Progesterone has antiinflammatory and
protective effects, similar tocortisol, butitdoesn't
have theharmful effects. Inhypothyroidism, there
isatendency tohave toomuch estrogen andcorti-
sol,andtoolittle progesterone.
The blood tests canbeuseful todemonstrate
tophysicians what theproblem is,butIdon't
think they arenecessary. There isevidence that
having 50or100times asmuch progesterone as
estrogen isdesirable, but Idon't advocate
"progesterone replacement therapy" intheway it's
often understood. Progesterone can instantly
activate thethyroid andtheovaries, soitshouldn't
benecessary tokeep using itmonth after month. If
progesterone isused consistently, itcanpostpone
menopause formany years.
Cholesterol isconverted topregnenolone and
progesterone bytheovaries, theadrenals, andthe
brain, ifthere isenough thyroid hormone and
vitamin A,andifthere arenointerfering factors,
such astoomuch carotene orunsaturated fatty
acids.
Progesterone deficiency isanindicator that
something iswrong, and using asupplement of
progesterone without investigating thenature of
theproblem isn't agood approach. The normal
time touseaprogesterone supplement isduring
the"latter half' ofthecycle, thetwo weeks from
ovulation until menstruation. Ifitisbeing used to
treat epilepsy, cancer, emphysema, multiple
sclerosis, migraine orarthritis, orsomething else
soserious thatmenstrual regularity isn't aconcern,
then itcanbeused atanytime.
MS:: What supplements doyoufeelareessen-
tialformost people with hypothyroidism?
RP: Because thequality ofcommercial nutri-
tional supplements isdangerously low, theonly
supplement Igenerally" advocate isvitamin E,and
that should beused sparingly. Occasionally, Iwill
suggest limited useofother supplements, butitis
farsafer ingeneral touse real foods, and to
exclude foods which arepoor innutrients. Magne-
sium istypically deficient inhypothyroidism, and
thesafest way togetitisbyusing orange juice
and meats, and byusing epsom salts baths;
magnesium carbonate canbehelpful, iftheperson
doesn't experience side effects such asheadaches
orhemorrhoids.
MS: Doyou feel that there areany special
considerations, issues, ortreatments formen with
hypothyroidism?
RP: Thyroid supplements can beuseful for
prostate hypertrophy andsome cases ofimpotence
andinfertility. Occasionally, aman who can't putonanormal amount ofweight finds thatathyroid
supplement allows normal weight gain. Leg
cramps, insomnia and depression areoften the
result ofhypothyroidism. Heart failure, gyneco-
mastia, liver disease, baldness anddozens ofother
problems canresult from hypothyroidism.
MS: Many people describe how they areclini-
cally hypothyroid, with elevated TSH levels, but
have extremely high pulse rates. Doyouhave any
thoughts astowhat might begoing oninthat
situation?
RP: Inhypothyroidism, thyrotropin-release
hormone (TRH) isusually increased, increasing
release ofTSH. TRH itself cancause tachycardia,
"palpitations," high blood pressure, stasis ofthe
intestine, increase ofpressure intheeye, and
hyperventilation with alkalosis. Itcanincrease the
release ofnorepinephrine, butinitself itactsvery
much like adrenalin. TRH stimulates prolactin
release, and this can interfere with progesterone
synthesis, which initself affects heart function.
Iconsider even thelowest TSH within the
"normal range" tobeconsistent with hypothyroid-
ism; ingood health, very little TSH isneeded.
When thethyroid function islow, thebody often
compensates byover-producing adrenal in.The
daily production ofadrenal inissometimes 30or
40times higher than normal inhypothyroidism.
The adrenal intends tosustain blood sugar inspite
ofthemetabolic inefficiency ofhypothyroidism,
anditcanhelp tomaintain core body temperature
bycausing vasoconstriction intheskin, butitalso
disturbs the sleep and accelerates the heart.
During thenight, cycles ofrising adrenalin can
cause nightmares, wakefulness, worry, and a
pounding heart. Occasionally, aperson who has
chronically had aheart rate of150 beats per
minute orhigher, will have amuch lower heart
rate after using athyroid supplement forafew
days. Ifyour temperature orheart rate islower
after breakfast than before, it'slikely that they
were raised asaresult ofthenocturnal increase of
adrenal inandcortisol caused byhypothyroidism.
M.S.: You have written that forsome people,
there isaproblem converting T4toT3,butthat
diet canhelp. You recommend apiece offruit or
juice ormilk between meals, plus adequate
protein, canhelp theliver produce thehormone.
Can you explain abitmore about this idea and
how itworks?
RP.: The amount ofglucose inliver cells
regulates theenzyme that converts T4toT3.This
means that hypoglycemia ordiabetes (inwhich
glucose doesn't enter cells efficiently) will cause
hypothyroidism, when T4can't beconverted into
T3.When aperson isfasting, atfirst theliver's
glycogen stores will provide glucose tomaintain
T3production. When theglycogen isdepleted, the
body resorts tothedissolution oftissue toprovide
energy. The mobilized fattY acids interfere with
the use ofglucose, and certain amino acids
suppress thethyroid gland. Eating carbohydrate
(especially fruits) canallow theliver toresume its
production ofT3.
M.S.: You have recommended ifsupplemental
T3isused, athyroid patients "nibble ona10-15
mgCytomel tablet throughout theday." Can you
explain why? Would compounded time-released
T3asavailable insome compounding pharmacies
dothesame?
RP.: Most hypothyroid people can success-
fully useasupplement that contains four parts of
thyroxine foreach part ofT3, butsome people
need alarger proportion of T3 for best
functioning. The body normally produces several
micrograms ofT3every hour, but ifalarge
amount ofsupplementary thyroid istaken ina
short time, theliver quickly inactivates some of
theexcess T3.Taking afewmicrograms perhour
provides what the body can use, and doesn't
suppress either theliver's orthethyroid's produc-
tion ofthehormone. Ihave only rarely talked to
anyone who had good results with theso-called
time-release T3,andIhave seen analyses ofsome
samples inwhich there was little ornoT3present.
Itishard tocompound T3properly, andthecondi-
tions ofeach person's digestive system candeter-
mine whether theT3isreleased allatonce, ornot
atall.Idon't think there isavalid scientific basis
forcalling anything "time-release T3."3.
Ihave been told that thecompany which now
owns the Armour name and manufactures
"Armour thyroid USP" hasadded apolymer tothe
formula, and Ithink this would account forthe
stories Ihave heard about itsapparent inactivity.
Some people have found that thetablets passed
through their intestine undigested, soIthink it's
advisable tocrush orpowder thetablets.
M.S.: You feelthatexcessive aerobic exercise
can beacause ofhypothyroidism. Can you
explain thisfurther? How much istoomuch?
R.P.: I'mnotsure who introduced theterm
"aerobic" todescribe the state ofanaerobic
metabolism that develops during stressful
exercise, butithashad many harmful repercus-
sions. Inexperiments, T3production isstopped
very quickly byeven "sub-aerobic" exercise,
probably because ofthecombination ofadecrease
ofblood glucose and anincrease infree fatty
acids. Inahealthy person, restwill tend torestore
thenormal level ofT3,butthere isevidence that
even very good athletes remain inahypothyroid
state even atrest. Achronic increase oflactic acid
and cortisol indicates that something iswrong.
The "slender muscles" ofendurance runners are
signs ofacatabolic state, that hasbeen demon-
strated even intheheart muscle. Aslow heart beat
very strongly suggests hypothyroidism. Hypothy-
roid people, who arelikely toproduce lactic acid
even atrest, are especially susceptible tothe
harmful effects of"aerobic" exercise. The good
effect some people feel from exercise isprobably
theresult ofraising thebody temperature; awarm
bath will dothesame forpeople with low body
temperature.
M.S.: You feelthat chronic protein deficiency
isacommon cause ofhypothyroidism. How much
protein should people get(asmuch as70-100
grams aday?) andwhat types ofprotein, inorder
toprevent hypothyroidism?
RP.: The World Health Organization
standard was revised upward byresearchers at
MIT, and recently theMIT standard has been
revised upward again bymilitary researchers; this
isdescribed inapublication ofthe National
Academy ofSciences (National Academy Press,
The Role ofProtein and Amino Acids inSustain-
ing and Enhancing Performance, 1999). When
toolittle protein, orthewrong kind ofprotein, is
eaten, there isastress reaction, with thyroid
suppression. Many ofthe people who don't
respond toathyroid supplement aresimply not
eating enough good protein. Ihave talked to.many
supposedly well educated people who aregetting
only 15or20grams ofprotein perday. Tosurvive
onthat amount, their metabolic rate becomes
extremely low. The quality ofmost vegetable
protein (especially beans andnuts) issolowthatit
hardly functions asprotein.
Muscle meats (including the muscles of
poultry and fish) contain large amounts ofthe
amino acids that suppress the thyroid, and
shouldn't betheonly source ofprotein.
M.S.: You talk about darkness and shorter
days ofwinter asastress. It'sknown that more
thyroid hormone isneeded bysome patients
during colder weather. Are there other things you
recommend patients doto"winterproof' their
metabolism?
RP.: Very bright incandescent lights are
helpful, because light acts on,and restores, the
same mitochondrial enzymes that aregoverned by
thethyroid hormone. Insquirrels, hibernation is
brought onbytheaccumulation ofunsaturated fats
inthetissues, suppressing respiration and stimu-
lating increased serotonin production. Inhumans,
winter sickness isintensified bythose same
antithyroid substances, soit'simportant tolimit
consumption ofunsaturated fats and tryptophan
(which isthesource ofserotonin). When aperson
isusing athyroid supplement, it'scommon toneed
four times asmuch inDecember asinJuly.
M.S.: You have reported that pregnenolone
can be helpful for Graves' patients with
exophthalmus. Canyouexplain further?
RP.: Graves' disease and exophthalmos can
occur with hypothyroidism oreuthyroidism, as
well aswith hyperthyroidism. Pregnenoloneregulates brain chemistry inaway that prevents
excessive production ofACTH andcortisol, andit
helps tostabilize mitochondrial metabolism. It
apparently acts directly onavariety oftissues to
reduce their retention ofwater. Inthelastseveral
years, allofthepeople Ihave seen who hadbeen
diagnosed as"hyperthyroid" have actually been
hypothyroid, andbenefitted from increasing their
thyroid function; some ofthese people had also
been toldthatthey hadGraves' disease.
M.S.: You areaproponent ofcoconut oilfor
thyroid patients. Can youexplain why?
RP.: Animportant function ofcoconut oilis
thatitsupports mitochondrial respiration, increas-
ingenergy production that hasbeen blocked by
theunsaturated fatty acids. Since thepolyunsatu-
rated fatty acids inhibit thyroid function atmany
levels, coconut oilcanpromote thyroid function
simply byreducing those toxic effects. Itallows
normal mitochondrial oxidative metabolism,
without producing thetoxic lipid peroxidation
thatispromoted byunsaturated fats.
M.S.: Doyou have anythoughts forthyroid
patients who aretrying todoeverything right, and
yetstillcan't lose anyweight?
RP.: Coconut oiladded tothe diet can
increase the metabolic rate. Small frequent
feedings, each combining some carbohydrate and
some protein, such asfruit andcheese, often help
tokeep the metabolic rate higher. Eating raw
carrots can prevent theabsorption ofestrogen
from theintestine, allowing theliver tomore
effectively regulate metabolism. Ifaperson
doesn't lose excess weight onamoderately low
calorie diet with adequate protein, it'sclear that
themetabolic rateislow. The number ofcalories
burned isagood indicator ofthemetabolic rate.
The amount ofwater lost byevaporation is
another rough indicator: For each liter ofwater
evaporated, about 1000 calories areburned.
M.S.: You have talked about internal malnutri-
tion asaproblem formany thyroid patients, dueto
insufficient digestive juices and poor intestinal
movements. Are there ways patients who are
treated forhypothyroidism canhelp alleviate this
problem.
RP.: The absorption andretention ofmagne-
sium, sodium, and copper, and thesynthesis of
proteins, areusually poor inhypothyroidism.
Salt craving iscommon inhypothyroidism,
and eating additional sodium tends toraise the
body temperature, andbydecreasing theproduc-
tion ofaldosterone, ithelps tominimize theloss
ofmagnesium, which inturn allows cells to
respond better tothethyroid hormone. This is
probably why alowsodium dietincreases adrena-
linproduction, and why eating enough sodium
lowers adrenal inandimproves sleep. Thelowered
adrenalin isalso likely toimprove intestinal
motility.
M.S.: You've mentioned eggs, milk and
gelatin asgood forthethyroid. Can youexplain a.
bitmore about this?
RP.: Milk contains asmall amount ofthyroid
and progesterone, but italso contains agood
balance ofamino acids. Foradults, theamino acid
balance ofcheese might beeven better, since the
whey portion ofmilk contains more tryptophan
than thecurd, and tryptophan excess issignifi-
cantly antagonistic tothyroid function. The
muscle meats contain somuch tryptophan and
cysteine (which isboth antithyroid andpotentially
excitotoxic) that apure meat diet can cause
hypothyroidism. Inpoor countries, people have
generally eaten allparts oftheanimal, rather than
justthemuscles--feet, heads, skin, etc.About half
oftheprotein inan animal iscollagen (gelatin),
and collagen isdeficient intryptophan and
cysteine. This means that, inthewhole animal, the
amino acid balance issimilar tothe adult's
requirements. Research intheamino acid require-
ments ofadults hasbeen very inadequate, since it
hasbeen largely directed toward fmding methods
toproduce farm animals with aminimum of
expense forfeed. The meat industry isn't inter-
ested infinding adietforkeeping chickens, pigs,
andcattle healthy into oldage. Asaresult, adult
ratshave provided most ofourdirect information5
about theprotein requirements ofadults, andsince
rats keep growing formost oftheir life, their
amino acid requirements areunlikely tobethe
same asours.
M.S.: Doyou think themaJonty ofpeople
with hypothyroidism gettoomuch ortoolittle
iodine? Should people with hypothyroidism add
more iodine, likekelp, seaweeds, etc.?
RP.: 30years ago, itwas found that people
intheUS were getting about tentimes more
iodine than they needed. Inthemountains of
Mexico and intheAndes, and inafew other
remote places, iodine deficiency stillexists. Kelp
andother sources ofexcess iodine cansuppress
thethyroid, sothey definitely shouldn't beused to
treat hypothyroidism.
M.S.: What areyour thoughts forGraves'
disease/hyperthyroidism patients? Should they
move ahead quickly togetradioactive iodine
treatment, orarethere natural things they might
beable totrytotemporarily -oreven perma-
nently -getaremission?
RP: Occasionally, aperson with agoiter will
temporarily become hyperthyroid asthe gland
releases itscolloid stores inacorrective process.
Some people enjoy the period ofmoderate hyper-
thyroidism, butifthey find ituncomfortable or
inconvenient, they canusually control itjust by
eating plenty ofliver, andmaybe some cole slaw
orraw cabbage juice. Propranolol will slow a
rapid heart. The effects ofathyroid inhibitor,
PTU, propylthiouracil, have been compared to
those ofthyroidectomy and radioactive iodine.
The results ofthechemical treatment arebetter
forthepatient, butnotnearly soprofitable forthe
physician.
Besides afew people who were experiencing
theunloading ofagoiter, andoneman from the
mountains ofMexico who became hypermeta-
bolic when hemoved toJapan (probably from the
sudden increase ofiodine inhisdiet, andmaybe
from asmaller amount ofmeat inhisdiet), allof
thepeople Ihave seen inrecent decades who were
called "hyperthyroid" were not. None ofthe
people Ihave talked toafter they hadradioiodine
treatment were properly studied todetermine the
nature oftheir condition. Radioiodine isafoolish
medical toy, asfarasIcansee, andisnever a
proper treatment.

and increased friendliness. Positive emotional responses

ratsduring light halothane anesthesia. Thyrotropin releasing
hormone (TRH) and two TRH analogues: thedesamidated
form (TRH-OH) and gamrna- butyrolactone- gamrna-
carbonyl-L-histidyl-L-prolinamide citrate (DN 1417) were
administered intracerebroventricularly. TRH 0.5-5 micro-
grams induced amarked tachypnoea with arapid onset and
aduration ofatleast 20min. DN1417, apotent analogue of
TRH with avery low TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone)
releasing activity was more effective instimulating respira-
tory frequency, while TRH-OH, regarded tohave neither
TSH releasing norextra hypothalamic effects, atequimolar
doses was unable toinduce anychanges intherespiratory
pattern. When TRH was given into thefourth ventricle the
dose response curve was slightly shifted tothe left. In
experiments employing theoccluded breath technique, PO.I
was increased inthesame magnitude asthemean inspiratory
flow (VT/TI). The results also indicated anincrease inthe
gain oftheinflation reflex loop whereas thecentral bulbo-
pontine setting forTland TTOT were notsignificantly
changed. Local injection ofTRH into thenucleus tractus
solitarii induced astimulation ofrespiratory frequency
which was slower inonset compared totheresponse seen
after injection into thelateral orfourth ventricles. Concomi-
tantly tothe respiratory changes, i.c.v. TRH injection
induced ahypocarbia and analkalosis. Nochanges in
blood pressure orheart rate were seen. The respiratory
stimulant effect ofTRH could bepotentiated bypretreat-
ment with naloxone, methylatropine oralow dose of
GABA. Haloperidol orpropranolol did not significantly
change the respiratory effects ofTRH, while reserpine
pretreatment seemed toblunt some oftheventilatory effects
ofTRH. Itseems likely that TRH hasfew direct effects on
brain stem neurones involved inthecentral regulation of
respiration, butthemain effects seem tobeelicited inareas
rostral tothebrain stem. The respiratory stimulating effect
ofTRH isunrelated toTSH. Furthermore, other neurotrans-
mitter systems might also beinvolved inmodulation ofthe
respiratory stimulation evoked byTRH.

Thyrotropin releasing hormone increases intraocular
pressure. Mechanism ofaction. LiuJH,Dacus AC, Bartels
SP.Eye Research Institute ofREtina Foundation, Harvard
Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts. Intravenous injec-
tions of1-I00micrograms thyrotropin releasing hormone
(TRH) inrabbits elevated intraocular pressure (lOP). The
2-5rom Hgincrease oflOP lasted forless than 2hr.No
change ofpupil size was observed. This lOP elevation was
notdue toadirect effect ofTRH onocular tissues since
intravitreal injections ofO.Iand Imicrograms TRH didnot
change lOP. Concentrations ofthyroid stimulating hormone
(TSH), triiodothyronine (T-3), epinephrine (Epi) and
norepinephrine (NE) intheplasma were elevated at30min
after ani.v.injection of10micrograms TRH. Plasma levels
ofprolactin and thyroxine were notchanged. Bolus i.v.
injections of0.1-1 micrograms TSH and0.1-1 micrograms
T-3, which would produce anequivalent increase ofrelevant
hormones inthecirculation, didnotincrease lOP. However,
similar Lv.injections of10-100 ngEpi and 100 ngNE
caused a1.5-3 mm HglOP elevation for15-30 min. Thus,
thelOP elevation following TRH administration probably is
caused bytheincrease ofcirculating endogenous catechola-
mines and not bythe stimulation ofthe TSH-thyroid
hormone axis. Heart rate, but not blood pressure, was
increased with 10micrograms TRH. After unilateral transec-
tionofthecervical sympathetic trunk, thelOP elevation in
thedecentralized eyewas larger than that intheintact eye.
Topical treatment of0.1%or1%timolol inthedecentralized
eye inhibited thelOP elevations inboth eyes, but0.1%
prazosin was not effective. Topical 1% atropine and
atropine given subcutaneously at0.6mg/kg decreased
thebilateral lOP elevations. These observations indicate
that beta-adrenergic and muscarinic mechanisms, notan
alpha- I-adrenergic mechanism, areinvolved.

cardiorespiratory activity ofaniodinated analog of
thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Paakkari I,Jarvi-
nen A,Vonhof S,Mannisto PT, Cohen LA, Labroo VM,
Feuerstein O.The biological activity ofthyrotropin-
releasing hormone (TRH) and itsanalogs 4(5)-I-Im-TRH
and 2,4(5)-I2-Im-TRH was assessed bymeans oftheir
effects on:I)themean arterial pressure (MAP), 2)heart rate
(HR), 3)ventilation minute volume (MV), 4)contractility of
theratduodenum, and 5)concentrations ofthyrotropin
(TSH) orprolactin (pRL) inserum. Also their binding to
TRH-receptors inbrain homogenates was studied. In
urethane-anesthetized rats TRH ICV increased MAP, HR
andMV. 4(5)-I-Im-TRH was equally asactive asTRH on
HR and MY but asignificant elevation inMAP was
observed only atadose 100-fold tothatofTRH. However,
themaximal responses of4(5)-I-Im-TRH andTRH didnot
differ. Inconscious rats, TRH IAelevated MAP and HR
but4(5)-I-Im-TRH was active onMAP only. 2,4(5)-I2-Im-
TRH was devoid ofcardiorespiratory activity. TRH dose-
dependently inhibited thecontractions oftheratduode-
num while theiodinated analogs lacked such anactivity. To
induce asignificant release ofTSH sevelal hundred times
more of4(5)-I-Im-TRH and over 1000 times more of
2,4(5)-I2-Im-TRH were needed ascompared toTRH. The
iodoanalogs elevated PRL levels only atdoses 2000-fold
higher than those ofTRH. The iodoanalogs displaced
[3H][3-Me-His2]TRH [(3H]MeTRH) from itsbinding sites
atconcentrations about 1000 times higher than those of
TRH. Substitutions ofthe histidyl moiety ofTRH in
4(5)-I-Im-TRH and2,4(5)-I2-Im-TRH resulted insubstantial
lossoftheendocrine activity. While thedi-iodinated analog
was practically devoid ofany biological activity the
monoiodinated analog exerted similar cardiorespiratory
activity tothat ofTRH.

Endocrine, cardiovascular, and behavioral effects of
intravenous protirelin inpatients with panic disorder.
Stein MB, Uhde TW Section onAnxiety and Affective7
Disorders, National Institute ofMental Health, Bethesda,
Md20892. The effects ofprotirelin administration onthe
anterior pituitary release ofthyrotropin and prolactin were
examined in26patients with panic disorder and22healthy
volunteers. There were nodifferences observed inhormonal
responses toprotirelin between patients and controls.
However, higher Beck Depression Inventory scores were
associated with smaller baseline-corrected maximal changes
inthyrotropin responses. Cardiovascular responses to
protirelin didnotdiffer between asubgroup of15patients
with panic disorder and ISage- andsex-matched healthy
controls. Although protirelin produced robust increases
inheart rate and blood pressure, only one patient with
panic disorder experienced apanic attack during the
infusion. Thehormonal fmdings suggest thatthepresence of
depressive symptoms may have asignificant impact on
various indexes ofneuroendocrine responsivity andshould
betaken into consideration when looking atbiologic
measures inpatients with panic disorder. The cardiovascular
and behavioral findings donotsupport thehypothesis that
allpanic-producing stimuli arenonspecific andsuggest that
theinduction ofphysical stimuli may beinsufficient to
produce panic attacks even insusceptible individuals.

were asked about possible (side-) effects; ventilatory and
cardiovascular monitoring was performed during steady
state. The pulsatile TSH-secretion pattern wasanalyzed and
thyroid and stress hormones were measured intheblood
prior toand following TRH i.v.Frequent symptoms afer
TRH were feeling ofheat (58%), stimulation ofrespira-
tion (61%), palpitations (39%), micturition urge (52%)
and restlessness (32%). Apparative monitoring demon-
strated ashort stimulation ofrespiration and an
increase ofheart rate. After 400 micrograms TRH i.v.,
blood levels ofACTH decreased slightly (pless than
0.01) butlevels ofT3, T4, epinephrine, norepinephrine and
cortisol remained unchanged (pgreater than 0.05).
TSH-levels were lowduring daytime andshowed asurge at
night.
AmJCardiol 1994 Feb 15;73(5):374-8. Usefulness of
L-thyroxine toimprove cardiac and exercise perform-
ance inidiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Moruzzi P,
Doria E,Agostoni PO, Capacchione V,Sganzerla P."The
short-term effects ofL-thyroxine (100 micrograms/day, 10
patients) and placebo (10 patients) onidiopathic dilated
cardiomyopathy were compared." "Adecrease inresting
systemic vascular resistances and anincrease incardiac
output (p<0.05) were also observed. Cardiopulmonary
effort parameters improved (p<0.05) without hemody-
namic changes atpeak exercise. Itisconcluded that
L-thyroxine short-term administration improves cardiac
and exercise performance inpatients with chronic heart
failure, without modifying theadrenergic support tothe
heart and thecirculatory parameters atpeak exercise."
JSteroid Biochem 1983 Jul;19(1B):433-8. Effects of
anterior pituitary hormones and their releasing
hormones onphysiological and behavioral functions in
rats. Lin MT, HoLT, Uang WN "The effects ofdirect
administration ofTRH, TSH, LHRH, LH, ACTH, GH, FSH
and prolactin into cerebral ventricle system onmetabolic,
respiratory, cardiovascular and behavioral responses were
assessed inunanesthetized rats, Intraventricular admini-
stration ofTRH, TSH, LHRH orLHcaused hypother-
mia, decreased metabolism and/or cutaneous vasodila-
tion atroom temperature (22degrees C)." "In addition,
intraventricular administration ofTRH, LHRH orLHcaused
tachycardia, hypertension and areduction in the
epinephrine-induced reflex bradycardia." "Furthermore,
following intraventricular administration ofTRH, but not
TSH, LHRH, LH, FSH, GH, ACTH orprolactin three
main categories ofbehavior were provoked: activity of
normal type--forward locomotion stimulation, head and
body rearing; stereotype activity--increased grooming
and head swaying; and abnormal type behavior--tail
elevation and piloerection inrats."

Astudy ofpituitary-thyroid function during exercise in
man. Sawhney RC, Malhotra AS, Gupta RB, Rai RM
"Exercise induced modulations incirculatory T4, T3and
TSH were monitored in14healthy euthyroid male volun-
teers undergoing exercise onabicycle ergometer at 750
KPM for20minutes." "Serum T4exhibited asignificant
decrease (Plessthan 0.05) from 9.6+/- 0.49 micrograrn/dl
(mean +/-SE) to8.3+/-0.47 microgram/dl at20min after
the termination ofthe exercise, whereas asignificant
decrease (Plessthan 0.01) inT3levels from 158+/-9ng/dl
to144+/-8.2ng/dl was recorded at40min after thetermi-
nation oftheexercise." "These observations suggest that
hormone secretion bythethyroid and itsresponsiveness
toendogenous TSH are maintained after exercise. The
decrease incirculatory T4and T3could bedue toan
increase indegradation ofthehormones ormay reflect a
generalized adaptation phenomenon. The exact mecha-
nism and significance ofthese alterations remains tobe
elucidated."
Arch Intern Med 1984 Jun;144(6):1149-52 Diagnostic
dosages ofprotirelin (TRH) elevate BPbynoncatechola-
mine mechanisms. Zaloga GP, Chernow B,Zajtchuk R,
Chin R,Rainey TG, Lake CR"While performing thyroid
function tests, wenoticed that protirelin (TRH) raised BP,
and, therefore, weinvestigated the effect ofdiagnostic
dosages ofprotirelin (500 micrograms) onplasma catechola-
mine levels and cardiovascular function ineight patients one
day before, one day after, and four weeks following heart8
surgery. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR),
plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI),
dopamine (DA), thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine
IT3], thyroxine), and thyrotropin (TSH) levels were
measured before and after theintravenous injection of
protirelin. Protirelin increased MAP transiently from 88
+/-2to103+/-3mmHg(before surgery), 86+/-4to102
+/-4mm Hg(one day after surgery), and 86+/-4to104
+/-5mm Hg(four weeks after surgery)." "We conclude
the following: (I) diagnostic dosages ofprotirelin
transiently elevate .MAP and SVR byanoncatechola-
mine mechanism, (2)clinicians who perform protirelin
tests should beaware ofprotirelin's transient pressor
effects."

circadian rhythms inplasma hormone levels (ACTH,
aldosterone, cortisol, C-peptide, insulin, DHEA-S, estradiol,
LH, prolactin, 17-0H progesterone, testosterone, T4and
TSH) were studied inApril 1981 in25males and 25
females 57to91years ofage, institutionalized atthe
Berceni Hospital fortheaged." "Incomparison with previ-
ousdata from theEndocrine Rhythms Laboratory ("C. I.
Parhon" Institute) andseries ofyounger subjects studied in
Minnesota (St.Paul-Ramsey Medical Center) aswell asin
comparison with data published from other centers, theaged
seem toexperience anearlier arousal oftheir endocrine
system which may berelated tocertain disturbances of
oldagee.g.ofsleep."

blind cross-over 12-month study ofL-thyroxine treat-
ment ofwomen with 'subclinical' hypothyroidism.
Nystrom E,Caidahl K,Fager G,Wikkelso C,Lundberg PA,
Lindstedt G."Twenty women, who had been randomly
selected from women with subclinical hypothyroidism
identified inapopulation study were treated with
L-thyroxine andplacebo inadouble-blind cross-over design
during 2x6 months." "Heart rate-corrected preejection
period and symptom score decreased (Pless than 0.05).
Four women starting with L-thyroxine showed amarked
and prolonged (4-6 months) rise inthyrotrophin concen-
tration during the subsequent placebo period, but
remained clinically euthyroid." "Subclinical hypothy-
roidism iscommon among middle-aged and oldwomen,
andourfindings indicate that approximately onewoman
infour with this 'subclinical' condition will benefit from
L-thyroxine treatment."
