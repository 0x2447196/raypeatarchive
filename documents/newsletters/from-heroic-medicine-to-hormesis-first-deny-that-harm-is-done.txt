From “heroic medicine” to
“hormesis”:  First deny thatharm is done
  
The holistic view of the organism and its
adaptive potentials, advocated by Hippocrates andAristotle, was rejected by the new science of thelast few centuries. Recovering that view, and usingit creatively, has become urgent, if we want tounderstand the processes of development, includ-ing aging and the degenerative diseases such ascancer, dementia, systemic inflammation, andfibrosis. Systematic efforts are being made to keeporganismic thinking on the sidelines.
When the “heroic medicine” that was taught in
the U.S. 200 years ago was replaced by milder,less risky procedures, some of the old attitudes andideas persisted—for example, the “healing crisis,”in which getting worse means that you’re gettingbetter. When mercury and arsenic were verycommonly used in medicine, a “healing crisis”often involved the same symptoms as poisoning bythose chemicals, but patients were convinced thatthe suffering was caused by the disintegration ofthe bacteria, not the medicine. When patients areruined by surgeries, chemotherapy, and radiation,they are convinced that it was all an effect of thecancer.Looking at the larger culture of western civili-
zation, “mortification of the flesh” for the good ofthe soul might be a relevant context for thesepersistent attitudes in medicine and biology.Athletes are told “no pain, no gain,” and manypeople are accepting the idea that suffering tough-ens you in general ways—fasting, cold showers,jogging, are said to improve immunity and delayaging.
The idea that a little bit of something harmful
is good for you was adopted by the petroleum,chemical and nuclear industries and their agents ingovernment around 1950, and treated as a scien-tific concept, with the name “hormesis.” When thepublic was starting to worry about the increasedradioactivity of the environment because ofnuclear bomb explosions, the US government wasactively suppressing information on the increasingamount of environmental ionizing radiation, butthey were even more active in promoting the ideathat “small amounts” of radiation are harmless andeven beneficial. People like John Gofman andErnest Sternglass were ostracized for demonstrat-ing that sickness and death were increased bythose “harmless or beneficial” amounts ofradiation.
In recent decades, it has been recognized that
our bodies produce small amounts of very toxicsubstances—carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide(NO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and hydrogenRay Peat's Newsletter

opportunity to sell new drugs, and agents of thepolluters have discovered that these endogenoustoxins can be useful to them. The reasoning is thatif every harmful experience of the organismincreases these substances, and if the organismsurvives those experiences, then the substancesmust have been produced as a protective-defensivereaction, meaning that there is an opportunity tosell drugs to increase them to prevent or treatdisease, and an opportunity for polluters to arguethat the substances are direct evidence of thebeneficial effects of the harm they have inflicted.
About 15 years ago, the proponents of the
hormesis idea gave it a more formal-soundingdefinition, as “a biphasic dose response,” whichcan be graphed with a “U” or inverted “U’ shaperather than the more common ascending ordescending line representing the relation of acertain function to increasing doses of a substance.The intention is to make the hormesis phenomenonseem like any general property of nature, such asosmosis, or electrical charge, or gravity, in which amathematical expression corresponds to a generalproperty of matter, advancing our understanding ofnature. 
The claim is that hormesis describes a relation
between an organism and its environment, but inreality each adaptive situation in which there is aresponse to a single substance or stimulus involvesthe whole organism, not simply a single receptorsubstance. The reason that an organism’s responseto a particular stimulus increases or decreasesdepends on the history and condition of the organ-ism, as well as on the nature and intensity of thestimulus. Different aspects of the organism areaffected by different substances or forces, and bydifferent quantities of those substances or forces.The “hormetic principle” corresponds to nothinguseful in the realm of organisms adapting to theirenvironment. The hormetic principle in ecology is analo-
gous to Noam Chomsky’s approach to linguistics,in which a person’s speech function is treated as ablack box, that can be adequately understoodwithout studying the brain and its use of language.It makes things very simple, but at best, it’sperfectly useless. A collection of grammaticalrules, supposedly derived from genes, could“account for” the structures of speech, butsomething else is needed to account for the selec-tion of the right rules in the right order in eachparticular circumstance. Chomsky’s linguisticshad the structure of reductionist science, but whatit lacked was the intelligence that characterizeslanguage use. The hormetic principle suffers fromthe same radical absence of knowledge about thenature of adaptation, which it claims to beexplaining.
The organizations that lavishly fund the
hormesis doctrine are generally those that haveopposed the “precautionary principle” in relationto food and environmental quality (on the groundsthat existing human harm must be demonstratedbefore regulatory action can be taken), and theyare now extending the argument to say that thepublic is being harmed by the regulations thatreduce pollution, because they aren’t getting anoptimal amount of hormetic stimulation. 
If toxins such as CO and NO are beneficial,
“hormetically,” when they occur in city air, thenobviously they must be very beneficial when theyare produced in the body by enzymes, whichevolved through the natural selection of thingsthat supported survival—there is a clear Panglos-sian aspect to neodarwinism, everything existsbecause of its fitness. In the neodarwinian world-view, both on the evolutionary time scale of aspecies and on the time scale of an individualorganism, “the world” sets the problem, and the2

into the world.
In their view of evolution, changes in the
species occur randomly, without meaning for theindividual, and meaningful for the species onlywhen its survival is threatened. That view perme-ated the culture of the 20th century; when HansSelye described his “General AdaptationSyndrome” he said “I call it adaptive because itstimulates defense.” Typical examples of stressorswere “starvation, being hit by a car, or sufferingthrough severe weather.” 
Another view sees every event in life, starting
with fertilization of an ovum, as a process ofadaptation—an active, purposeful, formative,constructive process of interacting with theenvironment and assimilating from it the thingsthat are situationally appropriate. If the environ-ments that the organism encounters are abundantin resources the organism will develop its capacity,tending to maximize its ability to interact construc-tively.  
Experiments over the last 60 years have shown
that more or less glucose, carbon dioxide, warmth,and progesterone during embryonic and fetaldevelopment can affect the growth of the brain,and the brain’s way of guiding future developmentand adaptive ability.
From a very early stage of development, the
nervous system coordinates the interactions oftissues. The rate of growth and function of eachtissue is adapted to the availability of the neededmaterials. Tissues in action consume resources,and idle tissues can dedifferentiate, redifferentiate,or disintegrate, according to the needs of thesystem. The parts of the developing organism arekept in balance by a hierarchy of mechanisms,intracellular, electronic-redox, mechanical, hormo-nal, nervous, and perceptual; Buckminster Fuller’sarchitectural concept of tensional integrity,
“tensegrity,” is a better metaphor for physiologythan the mechanistic medical concepts.
“Defense” is only one specialized aspect of
stress. In some species, prolonged deprivationleads to hibernation or estivation, decreasingenergy needs during the time of dearth.  Defensivereactions that simply assure survival often degradefunctioning of the individual. In any organism,prolonged deprivation has epigenetic effects thatare likely to become transgenerational. Growth ofthe brain, the organ with the highest requirementfor oxidative energy production, is disproportion-ately affected by gestati onal stress, with its growth
being retarded more than the growth of the rest ofthe body. For example, exposure to lead early inlife (Cragg and Rees, 1984), at levels that aren’tdirectly neurotoxic, inhibits the growth of thebrain, while stimulating the growth of the rest ofthe body, producing adults with a smallerbrain/body ratio.
In mediating adaptation, the brain orients the
organism toward aspects of the environment thatare most likely to satisfy its needs, and thisinvolves making judgments of possible futuresituations. In the absence of good prospects, thebrain concerns itself with defensive changes,increasing the stress hormones, the fight-or-flightmechanisms, and begins to convert some of itsown tissues to energy and materials needed for thesurvival of its essential organs, the brain, lungs,and heart. Cortisol, for example, selectivelybreaks down proteins in muscles and thymus, andactivates their conversion to glucose. 
The catabolic turnover of cell materials,
including the process of autophagy, is an alterna-tive to the organized disintegration of a cell,“apoptosis,” during stress.  Autophagy is activatedby stresses such as starva tion, glucose deprivation,
hypoxia, heavy metal poisoning, lipid peroxida-tion, and irradiation, allowing cells to survive.When the process is a direct response of cells toharmful environmental factors, while the nervoussystem is in a defensive state, the survival ofindividual cells will occur without regard to thepattern of the whole organism, and if the processis prolonged, the result will be loss of function ofa tissue or organ, fibrosis, or cancerization. 3
Existing drugs proposed for increas-
ing heme oxygenase include resveratrol,metformin and the statins.  However,many researchers have recognized thatthe short-term local benefits are associ-ated with very serious long-termharmful effects . . . .Part of the basic cellular defense reaction
involves enzymes that process toxins in ways thatimprove the immediate situation, but that cancreate new problems for the organism if theybecome chronic. For example, stressed tissuesproduce carbon monoxide and estrogen, whichprevent apoptosis and promote autophagy, withshort-term survival value.  Surviving in thestressed condition under the influence of CO andestrogen, the cells produce cytokines that affect thesensitivity of surrounding cells to stress andinflammation, and progressively undergo “epige-netic” changes, tending to become cells of a differ-ent type, with different types of metabolism,producing collagen to make the tissue more resis-tant to mechanical stresses, or becoming mobilecells, able to replace cells that have beendestroyed, healing wounds. 
This is very convenient when there are distinct
wounds, and necessary for survival; but when theharmful factors are continuously present in smallamounts, the continuing activation of theseenzymes has a cumulative effect, creating systemicinflammation and systemic fibrosis, even in thebrain, weakening the organized functioning of theorganism. 
With aging, the accumulation of polyunsatu-
rated fats intensifies those changes. Reacting withoxygen, the peroxidation of PUFA produces manytoxins, including carbon monoxide (Wolff, 1976),and one of the basic enzymes induced by stress iscyclooxygenase, producing prostaglandins. One ofthose, PGE2, activates heme oxygenase (Park, etal, 2009), the enzyme that produces carbonmonoxide from the breakdown of heme, and it alsoactivates aromatase, the enzyme that producesestrogen from androgens. The result is that theaccumulating PUFA function as amplifiers of thecellular stress reactions.  In experimentalsituations, the epigenetic changes produced bystress are reversible, but when the organism staysin the same sort of environment that started theprocess, reversals become less likely with increas-ing age.
Emotional stress is organized by the nervous
system, changing hormones and cell functions thatimprove immediate survival. Glucose deprivationseems to be a feature of stress that activates thecell survival enzymes, including heme oxygenaseand aromatase, and the autonomic nervous system
controls the organism’s reactions to stress, withthe cholinergic parasympathetic system tending toreduce glucose oxidation. Exaggerated activationof this system produces shock, with extremeinhibition of respiratory metabolism, but innormal circumstances, this system’s activityincreases during the night and decreases duringthe day. Even under the normal cyclic activity ofthe nervous system, increased activity of hemeoxygenase occurs during the night. Cholinergicchemicals activate heme oxygenase (Espada, etal., 2009; Hui, et al., 2012).
In the state of learned helplessness or chronic
despair, the relative dominance of the cholinergicsystem keeps the body in the inflamed, hypometa-bolic condition, in which rheumatoid arthritis,fibromyalgia, and sleep apnea are likely to occur.When carbon monoxide is produced in stress, thebreakdown of the heme molecule also releasesiron, and biliverdin, which is quickly turned intobilibrubin. Increases of bilirubin and carbonmonoxide in the body fluids or breath can be seenin many chronic conditions, along with changes intissue iron content.
Most publications have been concentrating on
the increase of heme oxygenase and carbonmonoxide during injury, sickness, and stress, withsuggestions that treatments (chemicals orradiation) to increase its production could bebeneficial. (Existing drugs that have beenproposed for increasing heme oxygenase includeresveratrol, metformin, and the statins.) However,many researchers have recognized that the short-term, local benefits are associated with veryserious long-term harmful effects, includingcancer, dementia, Parkinson’s disease (Song, etal., 2017) and other neurodegenerative diseases(Schipper, 2000; Song, et al., 2006; Schipper andSong, 2015), arthritis (Devesa, et al., 2005), liverdisease, and heart failure. Treatments to lowercarbon monoxide production have been tried in4

monoxide or  protect against its effects include
methylene blue, caffeine, aspirin, progesterone,
and red light.
During stress and aging, hemoglobin can be
released from red blood cells, and in that free formit’s very toxic, and so is the heme fragment (calledhemin when the iron is oxidized) that separatesfrom the protein. The main function of hemeoxygenase seems to be the removal of that toxicthreat, but in the process, free iron and bilirubinare released, creating new toxic threats. Someexperimenters (Regan, et al., 2004; Qu, et al.,2005, 2007) found that knocking-out HO-2reduced  the oxidative damage produced by
hemoglobin and hemin in the brain. 
The accumulation of iron in the tissues during
stress and aging makes them progressively morelikely to experience serious damage duringmoments of oxygen deprivation, as the iron atomscatalyze reactions such as lipid peroxidation (inwhich carbon monoxide is a product). Bilirubin,despite its ability to function as an antioxidant, isvery toxic to nerve cells, blocking the respiratoryenzyme (Day, 1954; Solá, et al., 2002; Vaz, et al.,2010), and promoting excitotoxic processes (Li, etal., 2012; Barateiro, et al., 2014; Yin, et al., 2016;Watchko, 2016). Bilirubin destabilizes red bloodcells, tending to increase the spilling of hemoglo-bin and heme, contributing to a vicious circle,hemolysis increasing bilirubin increasinghemolysis. 
It’s important to minimize “low level” stres-
sors and injuries, and to optimize the protectivefactors, such as light, carbohydrate, thyroidhormone, carbon dioxide, and a sense of ameaningful future.  A positively beneficial
environment supports constructive, and reconstruc-tive, processes in the body that can correct much ofthe damage done by bad aspects of the environ-ment, at any previous stage of development (Katz,et al., 1982; Yang, et al., 2015;  Griñan-Ferré, etal., 2016; Kentner, et al., 2016;). All of the body’stissues, including the brain, are subject to revisionand reconstruction. The weight of the brain, andthe thickness of the cortex can be increased byenvironmental enrichment (Díaz, 1988; Rosenz-weig and Bennett, 1996; Schrott, 1997; Lehohla, etal., 2004).Since these major changes are now known to
involve epigenetic “transitions” in cell type, of thesort that can be induced by carbon monoxide, it’spossible to imagine that the proper function ofheme oxygenase is to support progressiveimprovement in the organism’s “phenotype,”rather than the aging, inflammation, fibrosis, andcancer, that are now the eventual result of itsactivity. Heme oxygenase, and enzymes that makeNO, HCN, and H2S, might simply need theguidance of an organism’s response to an enrichedenvironment.
When the organism is working meaningfully,
useless structures tend to atrophy, as new struc-tures are developed. This is a normal part of ourdesign, in which the passive part of a functionalsystem is remodeled to support the integralpurpose. Unlike the specialization of a machine,the specialization in consciousness is alwaysincreasing the organism’s flexibility, diversity,and generality. 
Some people studying autism have found that
animals exposed to carbon monoxide have someof the behaviors of autistic children. Varioustoxins that have been associated with theincreased incidence of autism, for example aceta-minophen, activate the body’s production ofcarbon monoxide. Autistic people are often said to“think concretely,” to be “cognitively rigid.”Mechanistic reductionists “think concretely,” bydefinition, and are often cognitively rigid.
The quality that’s lacking in autism (Boucher,
et al., 2007) and in mechanistic reductionism istemporal thinking, the ability to think across time,as well as through space. Reductionists areideologically opposed to the idea that the futureparticipates in all processes, which they call“teleology.” 
Temporal thinking is the faculty that’s
engaged by an enriched environment, but it’swrong to call it “thinking,” because it’s simplythe way organisms exist, when their develop-ment hasn’t been blocked, physically orculturally.
