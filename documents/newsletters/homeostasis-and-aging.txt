Blood perfusion ofthebrain and heart and
muscles isincreased bycarbon dioxide, which is
logical, considering that carbon dioxide ordinarily
rises during metabolic activation. Butthekidneys
don't have thissimple response tocarbon dioxide,
andthisseems tobebecause ofthespecial roleof

function.
Blood flow tothe kidneys isregulated by
nerves and hormones. Parathyroid hormone and
growth hormone cause vasodilation inthekidney,
and increase itsblood flow. The increased flow
tends toproduce amore dilute, hypotonic urine.
Inthekidneys, carbon dioxide's effects aremuch
more complex than justregulating blood flow, and
thekidneys maintain aremarkably high concentra-
tion ofCO 2,causing some people toargue that
they concentrate itfrom
About 88years ago, J:1. (who is
known forhiscancer therapy) studied theparafuy-
roid hormone anditsrelation totetany (prolonged.muscle contraction) andconvulsIons, andwas able

extent interchangeable inalleviating thetetany
and convulsions produced byremoval ofthe
parathyroid gland, though was the
most effective. This work was ignored bythose
who wanted toestablish asimple relationship
between "one gland, one hormone, one mecha-
nism, one symptom ordisease." A.LCarlson's
group promoted the idea that the parathyroid
hormone's function was simply toincrease the
amount ofcalcium intheblood, and that itwascalcium which prevented tetany. This doctrine
hashadfar-reaching consequences.
The view which hascome todominate twenti-
ethcentury biology isthat organisms were assem-
bled byasimple-minded watchmaker named
Natural Selection, andthat they canbeunderstood
byreducing them totheir simple parts, theway we
understand awatch oramotor. Apolar opposite
tothat view would bethat nature isinfinite, but
knowable. To understand Koch's step from
tetany tocancer isn't possible within theconven-
tions ofordinary "medical endocrinology," but
Koch assumed that nature hadn't learned its
methods inmedical school. KQch postulated,
early inthe century, that electrons and free

proposed whenever needed.
The doctrine of"one gland-one action" caused
people to focus onthelow blood calcium which
occurs inthe tetany which isbrought onby
removal of the parathyroid gland (which
sometimes killed patients when their thyroids
were removed, along with theassociated parathy-
roids). Bythe1920s, surgeons were careful about
avoiding damage tothe parathyroids toavoid
tetany, but tetany kept occurring. They began
leaving part ofthethyroid gland, too, buttetany
still occurred inasignificant portion ofpatients.
Infact, tetany isarisk following other operations,
such asremoval ofthe gall bladder. Anew expla-
nation for ost-thyroidectomy tetany was
invented, "the hun bone syn rom 'based on
theidea that hyperthyroi Ism rosthebones of

consists largely ofthefailure toproduce carbon
dioxide inthemitochondria.
Simple hyperventilation causes muscle spasms
and paresthesia (prickling ofthe skin), inan
experiment anyone canperform inafew minutes.
When alarge amount ofcarbon dioxide isblown
off, the blood's pH increases very slightly,
because ofsystemic adjustments. The "calcium
deficiency" theory oftetany would suggest that
increased alkalinity ofthe blood decreases the
"availability" ofionized CalCiUID, and that
(somehow) the"decreased availability ofionized
calcium" interrupts arelaxed state ofthenerves
andmuscles. Atleast, that's theexplanation that I
have heard many times, though Iamstating itina
way thatmakes itsound fairly crazy. (See Stadler,
etal.,1995.) But, infact, everywhere calcium is
studied, itisanactivator, anexcitant, agoad to
activity, when itenters the cytoplasm. The
evidence isthat hyperventilation, which changes
theserum concentration ofbicarbonate, magne-
sium, potassium, chloride, and phosphate, does
not change the serum calcium concentration,
while itdoes increase the intracellular calcium
content. (Fujimoto, etal., 1987; Stadler, etal.,
1995.)
The combination ofthe calcium ion, Ca2+,
with the bicarbonate ion, HC0 3-,forms avery
soluble complex ionwith asingle positive charge.
Inthesaliva, there ismore carbon dioxide than in
themouth, andthissituation isbelieved toexplain
thefact that calcium which isdissolved inthe
saliva tends tobedeposited inaninsoluble form
asitloses itssolublizing bicarbonate, and the
insoluble form contributes todental plaque.4
(Presumably, this physical principle would
account forthedeposition ofcalcium inthewalls
ofblood vessels orinany tissue which is
relatively deficient incarbon dioxide.) Similarly,
when serum bicarbonate decreases, the calcium
escapes from itssoluble complex, and ineffect
the available calcium-the forms ofcalcium
which are not bound to bicarbonate--has
increased, exactly the opposite ofwhat the
Carlson school hasargued. .
Calcium, which isreleased into thecytoplasm
bytheexcitotoxins, triggers therelease offatty
acids, theactivation ofnerve andmuscle, andthe
release ofavariety oftransmitter substances, ina
cascade ofexcitatory processes, butatthesame
time, ittends toimpair mitochondrial metabolism,
and progressively tends to accumulate in
mitochondria, leading totheir calcification death,
which isalso promoted bythe antirespiratory
effects oftheunsaturated fatty acids andthelipid
peroxidation they promote. Iron andcalcium both
tend toaccumulate with aging orstress, andboth
promote excitatory damage; bicarbonate contrib-
utes tokeeping iron initsinactive state, and
probably has asimilar effect against abroad
spectrum ofexcitatory substances. Histamine
release, nitric oxide, and carbon monoxide are
broadly involved inexcitotoxic damage, and
carbon dioxide tends tobeprotective against
these, too.
Besides thesimple excitotoxic killing ofnerve
cells, theprocesses which impair carbon dioxide
production setin motion thelong degenerative
process that ranges from diabetic lacticacidemia
todementia. InAlzheimer's disease, brain respi-
ratory metabolism isinhibited, creating acarbon
dioxide deficiency with anexcess oflactic acid
and ammonia. Both Alzheimer's disease ·and
multiple sclerosis involve depressed brain
metabolism combined with an inflammatory
process. Inanyinflamed tissue, theenzyme beta-
glucuronidase isactivated, and this enzyme
releases estrogen within theirritated cell, activat-
inganother sequence ofneurotoxic processes.
InAlzheimer's disease, two other outstanding
features arethetangles ofmicrotubular material
left where cells have disintegrated, and the
amyloid plaques, which often form ill..
extracellular spaces and around blood vessels.
One oftheforms ofamyloid (amyloid isnamed
forits"starchy" appearance instained slides) is
produced from thenormal protein, transthyretin,
which carries vitamin Aand thyroid hormone,
when this protein is"glycosylated," bythe
addition ofsugar molecules. Inthisglycosylated
form, itresembles amutant protein, andbinds to
theextracellular matrix. This glycosylation can
occur spontaneously andquickly, intheabsence of
enzymes tocatalyze it,when there istoomuch
glucose present, and when theprotein's amino
groups (usually Iysines) arenotprotected bybeing
combined with carbon dioxide (as carbamino
groups). The carbamino groups form rapidly
when there isanabundance ofcarbon dioxide, but
also rapidly decompose intheabsence ofcarbon
dioxide, allowing theprotein tobestructurally
degraded bytheaddition ofsugar molecules.
Reactions very similar tothese occur when the
products oflipid peroxidation attach themselves to
proteins.
Similar reactions, reflecting metabolic and
energetic conditions, can alter thestructure and
organization oftheneurotubules, leading tocell
death and the formation ofthe characteristic
neurofibrillary tangles.
W.F.Koch alsofound that excessive coagula-
tion was produced inthe toxic antirespiratory
state. Carbon dioxide, probably bycontrolling the
availability ofcalcium, isanimportant protection
against abnormal clotting. The prevention of
clotting bycarbon dioxide isthought tobepartof
theexplanation foritsprotective effect against
oxygen deprivation. (pak and Sverchkova, 1987.)
Hyperventilation causes increased vascular perme-
ability, leading tohemoconcentration when alarge
portion oftheblood's water escapes into the
tissues. Vascular spasm, increased viscosity of
theconcentrated blood, anddisturbed coagulation
processes undoubtedly contribute toawide range
ofhealth problems, including stroke, heart attack,
andmultiple sclerosis.
Since permanent high altitude residents
chronically retain alarger amount ofcarbon
dioxide intheir tissue, Ihave looked fordata on
theincidence ofdegenerative brain disease among
high altitude populations. InKashmir, a5
house-to-house study ofmore than 66,000 people
found that nearly one percent ofthepopulation
suffered from some neurological impairment,
such. ascerebral palsy, epilepsy, mental retarda-
tion orstroke. But nocases ofAlzheimer's
disease ormultiple sclerosis were found. InIndia,
theincidence ofthese diseases ismuch lower than
intheU.S., but their absence inKashmir IS
remarkable.
Ifexcess lactic acid inthebrain tissue is
characteristic ofAlzheimer's disease andmultiple
sclerosis, then the"lactate paradox" suggests that
aslightly higher retention ofcarbon dioxide inthe
brain ofKashmir residents would counteract
chronic excitotoxic effects, suppressing the
stress metabolism which leads tothedegenera-
tive brain diseases. Experimentally increased
carbon dioxide tends todecrease intracellular
calcium, andtodecrease brain excitability.
Cancer, the classical disease ofextreme
"aerobic glycolysis," isalso negatively associated
with increased altitude. Mortality from heart
disease, too, decreases with increasing altitude,
andtheroleofcarbon dioxide inheart function is
very clear.
The neuroprotective steroids, progesterone
and pregnenolone, and magnesium a:ld carbo;l
dioxide allprotect against excitoxicity and the
related excess ofintracellular calcium, while
promoting normal calcification. The thyroid
hormone happens topromote theproduction of
these steroids andcarbon dioxide, andthereten-
tion ofmagnesium. Bythesimple process of
avoiding theantithyroid substances, especially the
polyunsatured fatty acids, the degenerative
processes discussed here will beminimized.
Cyanide, another common component offoods
(usually inthe bound form ascyanogenic
glycosides, inseeds, sprouts, nuts, and grains),
has specific antagonisms tocarbon dioxide,
thyroid, andrespiration.
