thatthecellneedsmoreenergytoget

Formanyyears,alewphysicians have
knownaboutthequietingeffectsof thyroid,
andhaveprescribed itlorhyperactive
kids,aswellasforlethargic ones,andfor
olhelWise healthykidswith"growing
pains."Sincethemid-1950s, therehas
beenaterribleincrease intheincidence
ofhyperactivity inchildren, asdiscussed
byTomBrewer,largelybecause of
prenatal Injury.Theincreased useof
unsaturated vegetable oils(proven 10
causebraindamageinrats)hascertainly
playedarole.Themoreunsaturated an
oilis,themorestrongly itinterferes with
thyroidsecretion, thetransportofthyroid
hormone intheblood,andtheresponse
01thetissuethyroid receptors.
Hypothyroidism, bothprenatally and
duringchildhood, severely limits
development ofthebrain.
Itisasimplefactthatnervecellsmust

abouttheconvulsions produced by
extreme hypoglycemia, andsomeknow
thatalackofoxygen canproduce

relaxation. Otherwise, noonewould
hesitatetousethyroidhormone (andits
energy-associated co-factor, magnesium)
forinsomnia, hyperactivity, andthewhole
rangeofenergy-related problems.
(Incidentally, thyroxine alonecanbe
counter-productive, bycompeting withthe
respiration-promoting triiodothyronine,
andbysuppressing TSHsecretion even
whenT3isdeficient. Similarty, anormal
orhighlevelofthyroxine intheblood
doesn't meanthatthepersonisn't
hypothyroid, sinceT3istheactive
hormone. MostofourT3isproduced in
theliver.)
