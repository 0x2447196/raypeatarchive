Immunology, Ideology,
Power
In 2005, experiments showed that injecting
the spike protein from a corona virus causedlungs to fail (Kuba, et al.), and that antibodiesformed to the spike protein damaged the lungs(Lin, et al.). For several decades, it has beencommon knowledge that autoimmune disease(such as “rheumatic fever”) could result fromthe cross reaction of antibodies with microbialantigens and antigens on the person’s tissues.Recent studies are confirming the risk ofautoimmune disease from antibodies to thecovid spike protein. One cross-reaction withthe spike protein is the lung surfactant protein(Vojdania and Kharraia n, 2020; Talotta, 2021).
Cross-reactive antibodies and autoimmuneprocesses are also involved in cancer andinfertility.
With both the spike protein and the
antibodies to it producing such deadly effects,using it in a vaccine to protect against thecorona virus would have seemed crazy toanyone following immunol ogical and virologi-
cal research after 2005, and the thought ofimplanting a nucleic acid to cause the body toproduce the spike protein would have seemedlike criminal insanity at that time. Just 12 yearslater, big corporations and their governmentsupporters found it convenient to forget therecent science. For example, in 2017 the chiefmedical officer of the Moderna corporation
gave a talk about what a nifty and simple ideaif would be to cause the body to produce itsown vaccine. Describing the process, he said“So, here’s all the biology you need to knowin 30 seconds.” For the  corporations and the
public health officials, that’s all the biologythey want to know, and all they want thepublic to know.
In the immunity that results from interac-
tions with pathogenic organisms, and in theimmunity produced by a traditional vaccinemade from killed or weakened pathogens, thebody forms antibodies to many parts of thepotentially harmful organism. The result isthat we accumulate a great variety of antibod-ies to multiple pathogens, and in the case ofcorona viruses, children accumulate additionalimmunity each time th ey have a cold. This
means that almost all children and adults areimmune to a great variety of corona viruses.
At birth, there are natural antibodies, that
developed along with the differentiation oftissues. Naturally, they  don’t inactivate the
body’s own tissues; they persist through life,but decrease with aging, increasing thesusceptibility to infections and to loss ofnormal functions (Palma, et al., 2018). Theyapparently serve to pr otect tissues, recognizing
and eliminating deviations from normal(Britschgi, et al., 2009). Their existence hasbeen generally accepted only in recent Ray Peat's Newsletter

the dominant theory of immunity.
With natural antibodies, the issue of cross-
reactive antibodies and autoimmunity doesn’texist, but when the specialized adaptiveantibodies are produced, cross-reactivity isalways a problem—other organisms vary intheir tissue antigens, and antibodies binding tothose will have varying degrees of cross-reactive affinity for our own tissues. Forexample, the lactobacilli that thrive in womenduring their fertile years have some antigensthat resemble human connective tissues, andit’s possible that they are a factor in diseasessuch as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis that areprevalent in women especially during thoseyears. Any infection or vaccination, especiallywhen there’s an excess of estrogen or adeficiency of antiinflammatory factors, canpermanently damage your health.
  The first two people in the U.S. reported to
have died from “covid,” at the end ofFebruary, 2020 were in their 80s and 90s, in anextended care home in the Tacoma, Washing-ton area, and within a few days a third deathwas also said to have been caused by covid;their deaths were attributed to covid on theb a s i s  o f  a  P C R  t e s t  t h a t ,  d e s p i t e  n o t  h a v i n gbeen validated as tests normally are, had justbeen authorized for use under a newly adoptedEmergency Use Authorization.

recommended, and the CDC ordered, theoperation of the test at 40 to 45 cycles, knownto produce mostly false positive results was
widely noticed : as testing increased nationally
beginning in March, the incidence of “cases ofcovid” increased at the same rate as the testing.The “test epidemic” served to create an eager-ness to get the inoculation. Exactly a year afterthe WHO had begun promoting the testingmethod of Christian Dros ten, with instructionsto misuse it, the inoculation campaign was
underway, and the WHO changed its instruc-tions, reducing the number of cycles—withthe obvious intention of creating an impres-sion that the inoculations were lowering therate of infection, as the number of falsepositive results was immediately reduced.
In the late 19th century Paul Ehrlich,
working with the German dye industry,noticed that different bacteria and tissuesvaried in their affinities for coal tar dyes. Hereasoned that the ability of some dyes to killcertain pathogenic organisms was analogousto specific immunity, such as demonstrated byvaccination. He extended his dye-bindingtheory to the use of arsphenamine (Salvarsan,Compound 606) to treat trypanosomiasis andsyphilis. His Nobel lecture (1908) was adetailed description of a theory in which tissueand chemical side chains were similarlyresponsible for the therapeutic effects of drugsand the protective effects of antibodies. Histheory made the “magic  bullet” idea of drug
therapy popular, reinforcing the idea that eachdisease has its specific drug remedy.
The power of the drug industry was able to
make that idea central to medicine, and itshaped thinking about vaccines for the nextcentury.
Metchnikov’s 1908 Nobel lecture wasn’t
just about phagocytosis, it was an alternativeview of immunity as a pervasive multi-levelprocess, involving learning and tissue mainte-nance as well as specific elimination of patho-gens. It was either ignored or disparaged bymedical researchers until the end of the 20thcentury. He said that at the present time, heknew of only one substance that could assistthe innate immune system, and that wasquinine. Recent studies relating to a singlekind of cell sensor, the Toll-Like Receptors(TLRs), have found that quinine reduces their
activation of cytokines and antibodies. Angio-
tensin, the covid virus (Sarius and Perlman,2021), endotoxin, estr ogen, and ionizing
2radiation have opposite effects, activating
TLRs and increasing cytokine and antibodyproduction.
In Metchnikov’s time, chloroquine and
hydroxychloroquine hadn’ t been synthesized
yet. Those drugs weren’t introduced becausethey were in some way superior to quinine. Inthe 1930s, Germany and the US wanted newdrugs to treat malaria, to get around Dutchcontrol of the world  quinine supply, and
produced several synthetic variations ofquinine, including chloroquine. In 1950,hydroxychloroquine was pr oduced to avoid the
retinal toxicity of chloroquine. Recently,because of reports that hydroxychloroquinecould be helpful for tr eating the corona virus
infection, some researchers compared theeffects  in vitro  of quinine and the two synthet-
ics on human cells (Grosse, et al., 2021). Theyfound that natural quinine, like the synthetics,effectively blocked the infection of humancells by the corona virus, but was safer. Themore toxic chloroquine had previously beenfound to have antiviral effect against SARScoronavirus (Vincent, et al., 2005).
Metchnikov’s developmental, multilevel,
cellular view of immunity was incompatiblewith “modern medicine.” The AmericanMedical Association was founded in 1847 topromote “scientific” allopathic medicine, andto suppress the practice of homeopathy,empirical medicine, herbalism, etc. It opposedthe use of “crude” herbal preparations, andconsidered it necessary to find a pure chemicalsubstance to specifically treat each condition,such as a microbial infection, a parasite, or,later, a genetic defect. This theory of medicineis a perfect match for the pharmaceuticalindustry, and for Ehrlich’s analogy of “magicbullet” chemotherapy to the function ofantibodies.
It was only a little more than 20 years ago
that Jamie Cunliffe’s “morphostasis” and“damage theory” and Polly Matzinger’s“danger theory” broke away from thedominant antibody theory of immunity, which
was based on Macfarlane Burnet’s mechanis-tic, neodarwinian “clonal deletion” theory.These new theories were, in effect, extensionsof Metchnikov’s developmental approach inwhich immunity is a process of generating andmaintaining the organism. When a cell isdamaged, it releases internal componentsincluding DNA, RNA, and ATP, and these arerecognized by cells that promote repair of thedamage, under the guidance of systemic inter-actions. Unfamiliar antig ens will be eliminated
along with the damaged tissue, by a combina-tion of many factors, from phagocytes toantibodies.
A few people had been recognizing the
failure of the clonal deletion theory for a longtime. At an international meeting ofimmunologists in 1969 at the University ofOregon, a young teacher had demonstratedthat the deleted clones could be restored,giving the original repertoire of antibodies, ifthe immune cells were simply cultured at ahigher density than Burnet and Nossal hadused, allowing the cells to interact with eachother, forming a network that was able todetect, and repair, the deletions.
Although his lecture was attended by only
a few people, and the main speakers acted asthough it hadn’t happened, Niels Jerne appar-ently noticed it, because he later presented analternative to clonal deletion based on his ideaof an “idiotype-antiidiotype network” (Jerne,1974). By itself, it wasn’t an adequate theory,but it moved in the right direction. Thedamage and danger theories have provided away to discard the various Nobel Prizewinning theories of antibodies and theirfunctions, and to begin seeing immunity andresistance as holistic processes of theorganism.
The nature of protective reactions has been
obscured by thinking in terms of “the immunesystem,” as something distinct from metabolicand adaptive processes. The various
3“-phylaxes,” starting with skeptophylaxis
(lightning or quick protection), have made itclear that the endocrine system and metabolicsystems are deeply involved in the adaptiveprotections.
Although mast cells and basophils are
usually the main sources of histamine, experi-ments have shown that under the most extremeconditions, all of the cells studied producedhistamine. Energy deprivation activates theformation of histamine, which activates many“immune” functions, including increasing theTLRs, and production of cytokines andantibodies. Histamine should probably bethought of as one of the signals of danger ordamage. It seems to correspond to the catabolicphase of an infection.
Although inflammation can occur without
infection, its presence is generally thought toindicate infection. The corona virus infectionsinactivate the ACE2 enzyme, whose functionsinclude destroying angiotensin II, a basicpromoter of inflammation, so, more than otherkinds of infection, it is a disease of inflamma-tion. Since inflammation activates the clottingsystem, it is a disease of inflammation andcoagulation. Before the WHO declared thepandemic, China was tr eating covid infections
with antiinflammatories and anticoagulants.Outside of China, governments have ordereddoctors not to treat early cases of covid, untiltheir symptoms were serious enough to requirehospitalization and oxygen treatment. OnOctober 22, 2020, the F DA approved the use
of remdesivir in covid patients, but remdesiviris neither antiinflammatory nor anticoagulant;inflammation is one of its side effects.
Histamine helps to rouse the immune
functions, and promotes inflammation andcoagulation.
In a prolonged excess, it tends to calcify
soft tissues, reducing their functions. Likeserotonin, it activates carbonic anhydrase, andis activated by estrogen and a reducingenvironment. While histamine is a basicorganizing factor in immunity, its effects have
to be blocked for completion of the immuneprocesses. Increased oxidative metabolismlowers histamine and inflammation systemi-cally, for example by lowering the ratio ofestrogen to progesterone.
Although anaphylaxis is usually thought of
as something separate from the immuneresponse, I think it just represents a quickentry into the high-histamine state, because oflow energy reserves and slow mobilization ofthe hormones of homeostasis. In the 1960s, V.W. Adamkiewicz showed that reducing bloodglucose with insulin greatly intensified aller-gic reactions, while inc reasing blood glucose
prevented deadly anaphylaxis, but weakenedresistance to infection. Energy metabolismgoverns the effectiveness of the immuneprocess, including the avoidance of autoim-
munity (Gaber, et al., 2017).
Metabolic energy is involved in every
aspect of the covid infection, but that has beendenied or ignored because of a traditional,ideological understanding of immunity. Denialof obvious facts isn’t a ra re thing in the history
of science, but the recent world-wide reactionsto the corona virus epi demics, including crimi-
nalization of the traditi onal medical practice of
treating symptoms, are unique and completelyoutside any scientific, medical, or legalstandards. 
Moderna had been working on RNA
vaccines for years when the “novel” coronavirus was identified, and they had been testingit as a vaccine for corona virus in mice, sow h e n  t h e y  r e c e i v e d  t h e  g e n e t i c  c o d e  b ytelephone from China, it took them only a fewhours to produce the vaccine. As they rushedthrough the preliminary trials, it supposedlydidn’t occur to anyone that the vaccine mightspread throughout the body, or that it wouldinfect the lining of blood vessels with thespike protein, or that the infected endothelialcells would cause systemic clotting andinflammation, or that if the spike protein
4reached the lungs it would severely damage
them, or that anti-spike antibodies would betoxic to the lungs, or that anti-antispikeantibodies would contain an antigen similar tothe spike antigen. Th ey, like Pfizer, were
undoubtedly aware of the risks of the sheddingphenomenon. These facts would imply eitherthat no one in the vaccine business had studiedphysiology or immunology with any attention,or that their plan—to inoculate everyone in theworld with a highly toxic geneticmaterial—wasn’t intended to improve publichealth.

The intensity of experimental and clinical
immune responses was correlated with the degreeof glycemia of the reacting subject. Hyperglyce-mias resulting from overdosage with sugars, corti-sol, adrenaline, or from diabetes inhibit theanaphylactoid reactions; anaphylaxis, and thetuberculin reaction; but potentiate infections.Hypoglycemias resulting from fasting, insulin andadrenalectomy potentiate the anaphylactoidreactions, anaphylaxis, and the tuberculin reaction;but inhibit infections. The hypothesis is proposedthat hyperglycemia inhibits certain antigen-antibody combinations; this results in an inhibitionof hypersensitivity, but an aggravation of infection.
