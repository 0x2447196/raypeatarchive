Edema, estrogen, andaging: A
universal problem, andbetter
therapies
Before talking about theharmful effects of
edema, andofthethings thatcause erlem<!, andof
thethings that canremedy thevarious edemas, I
think it'snecessary tolook atafewrecent events
inthevery long history ofmedicine's intervention
inthisproblem ofexcessive tissue water. Other-
wise, Idon't think thegreat importance ofedema,
anditsfundamentally "estrogenic" nature, will be
clear. Aging, shock, hypertension, cancer, heart

tant inthe regulation ofwater, which isaImajor problem instress and aging.
failure, and many other biological problems
involve edema asacentral factor, and relieving
theedema isprobably anessential partofsolving
those problems.
Some people denned "homeostasis" as
maintaining aconsistency inthethings dissolved
ill Ult:budy's water. PhysiologiSlS have tried to
explain how homeostasis ismaintained, butthey
have had thegreatest difficulty with understand-
ingthewater itself, andthethings which allow the
body tomaintain theright amount ofwater inthe
various compartments ofthebody. Edema ("an
abnormal collection ofliquid") isn't asophisti-
cated concept, andisgenerally used interchangea-
blywith "water retention" and"swelling."
Many people think ofedema asanesthetic
problem: They don't like theappearance offat
fmgers, swollen ankles, puffy eyelids, andsoggy-
boggy tissues inother areas. Swollen breasts and
uterus cancause pain, andoften occur premenstru-
allyalong with more generalized water retention.Estrogen's role inedema isunderstood bymany
women, but therapies 'have generally been
directed toward thewater itself, with empirical
diuretics, because edema's causes aren't
explained inmedical texts.
Tbs is,toagreat extent, theresult ofdeliber-
atedistortion bythedrug industry oftheissues
involved. Beginning inthe 1950s, thesaleofnew
patented diuretics (replacing traditional diuretics)
began inanatmosphere inwhich estrogen was
being given topregnant women, toprevent
various complications ofpregnancy (which infact
were caused byexcessive estrogen). Excess estro-
genasthecause oftoxemia couldn't bediscussed
openly, andthediuretics were sold asadditional
tools forcontrolling pregnancy-associated water
retention, weight gain, high blood pressure, and
damage tothefetus. Pregnant women were also
told todiet tolimit weight gain, and tosharply
limit their consumption ofsalt. Estrogen, diuret-
Shock, pneumonia, and hypertension are
among theconsequences ofedema.
Understanding edema isessential for
llnrlerst2!!d ingstress, fc!" preventing stree3-
induced sickness, and forresuscitation
ics,saltrestriction, anddieting were demonstrably
allharmful topregnant women and their babies,
butthey were imposed bythepharmaceutical-
medical establishment. (Besides their appalling
promotion ofthe new diuretics "to prevent
toxemia," thepharmaceutical industry presented
thenew cWorothiazide diuretics astheonly drugs
capable ofcorrecting the "sodium problem,"
creating multiple urmecessary confusions.)
Emphasis ondiet and sodium restriction
served toputtheblame forpregnancy problems
on the women who couldn't control their
appetites. Besides themedical obscurantism that
didn't want toexamine estrogen's role intoxemia
ofpregnancy, there was amechanical conception
ofthecauses ofedema. Although noone could
explain how amolecule could fling anatom of
sodium outofacelloracross membranes such as
thekidney tubules, "sodium pumps" were said to
explain thedifferent concentrations ofsodium in
different compartments, and water was said to
passively "follow thesodium." This theory failed
toexplain how water could beretained while
sodium was lost, orwhy osmotic pressure varied
under certain conditions ..
Physical chemists understood how water could
bemoved from one compartment toanother, by
theprocess ofelectro-osmosis, butcell physiolo-
gists still generally believe intheir s<;>dium pwnps
andgive them responsibility forthedistribution of
water. Medical textbook discussions ofedema
have apitiful-comical quality, because their elabo-
rateRube Goldberg machines* don't dowhat they
aresupposed todo,despite alltheir embarrassing
adhoc devices andconvolutions.
Because oftheabundance ofoxygen inthe
world, most things areinarelatively oxidized
state. Oxygen's name means "source ofacid,"
anditcreates acids because ofitsgreat affinity for
electrons. Acidity isdefmed asatendency to
accept electrons, ortorelease protons. Inwater,
itiscommon tospeak only about theprotons, and

proteins and nucleic acids becaus6 oftheir polar,

*Rube Goldberg, who was educated asanengineer,
described hiscartoon machines as"symbols ofman's capac-
ityforexerting maximum effort toaccomplish minimal
results." Hesaid "there aretwo ways todothings, the
simple andthehard way, andasurprisingly large number of
people prefer doing things thehard way."
Soluble alkaline materials, with atendency to
rtiease electrons oraccept protons, associate with2
theacidic groups, tending toproduce aneutral
pH. However, extremely water soluble chemicals
don't have complete freedom toassociate with
their oppositely charged groups inmaterials that
are insoluble inwater; some enter, some are
excluded. This principle can bedemonstrated
with drops ofsimple acidic organic liquids
suspended inwater containing ionized solutes:
Their different solubility, combined with their
chemical affinities, creates anequilibrium, in
which theorganic droplet hasanegative electrical
charge.
Dead cells, such ashair, behave inthis way
too, because this electrical and ionic behavior is

phase. It isthe failure torecognize ordinary
physics and chemistry that has made Rube
Goldbergian cell physiology seem plausible toso
many people. Bioelectricity, andionic selectivity,
are fundamentally passive, near-equilibrium
processes, that don't require any convoluted
"special" aaratuses toexplain them.
Whe oxidative metabolism enters thepicture,

metabolism, along with the formation of

This affinity, which predisposes ittoreact With

adsorptive properties, butthese arepassed over by
most physiologists. CC1.Iton dioxide is
active inmany ways, besides itscontributions to
bicarbonates and carbonates and carbamates and

Both spontaneously, and enzymically, carbon

tItogether, there aremany pathways that lead tothe
excessive accumulation ofwater intissues. In
hypothyroidism, the adrenergic nervous system
tends tooveractive, and adrenalin production is
sustained atahigh level even when there isn't any
external reason for it,since itisneeded to
maintain adequate blood sugar and energy, inthe
inefficient metabolic state ofhypothyroidism.
Adrenalin mobilizes free fatty acids from
tissues, including fat and muscle tissues.
Estrogen itself produces elevated free fatty
acids. When thefree fatty acids are unsatu-
rated, they cause edema, bymaking blood
vessels leaky, and bymaking cells take up
ext:-a water; thiscan cause bmin swelling, stiff-
ening oftheheart muscle, and thickening of
thelining ofblood vessels, eventually obstruct-
ingthem. VuW'

isthedefining feature ofhyperventilation, butthe
presence ofabnormally high adrenergic activity,
andoffree fatty acids, stimulates further hyper-

respiration even more, leading toincreased lactic

voltage ofabout atenth ofavolt, while redblood
cells, that don't produce energy byrespiration,
show anelectrical potential ofless than 1/400 of
avolt. This ispartly amnemonic device for
visualizing the general scheme inwhich
equilibrium conditions interact with dynamic
metabolic processes. The adsorptive effects of
carbon dioxide, and agreat variety ofother chemi-
cal effects, modulate the cell's structure .and
function sothat itretains farmore potassium than

carbon dioxide's effects onminerals makes it
possible tounderstand thefactthattheblood's pH
ishigher than thecell's, andmany other mysteries,
WIthout resort tospecial hypothetical devices.
Thealkaline metals that have been mobilized from
respiring cells inassociation with carbonic acid
remain alone inthe blood when carbonic acid
turns into gaseous carbon dioxide and leaves the

ingagreat risk ofhypertension byreducing the
blood volume needed foradequate perfusion of
thekidneys, anddamaged thedevelopment ofthe
fetus, because ofinadequate blood perfusion of
theuterus andplacenta.
After Iwas convinced ofthemanner inwhich
salt restriction could cause edema, and knowing
that women are told torestrict salt toprevent
premenstrual edema, Ibegan suggesting that
women salttheir food totaste, increasing their salt
consumption premenstrually ifthey craved it.I
had never known ofsalt restriction toprevent
premenstnl2.! edema, D;Jt Iirrnnediately began
hearing that thewomen who ateallthesaltthey
wanted no longer experienced premenstrual
edema. .
After acouple ofyears, Iwas satisfied that
adequate protein and salt consistently prevented
premenstrual edema. Iread anarticle bysome
people who noticed that their patients who were
onlow sodium diets "for high blood pressure"
very often developed insomnia. They knew that
sodium restriction raised adrenal inlevels, sothey
took thell" patients offthelow sodium diet, and
cured their insomnia.
Since Ihadbecome asound sleeper assoon as
Ibegan taking thyroid, and had seen that thyroid
alone would cure most people's insomnia
(sometimes, asone doctor described hisexperi-
ence, "better than morphine") Ibegan toundeJ-
stand that theadrenal inwhich disturbed sleep was
anindicator ofdefer-five energy pronuction, ?!i.e!
that thethings which restored sleep=thyroid, salt.
...sU8...ar, Qrotein, and progesterone, for
example-were acting directly on the cells'
energy production.
Since elevated adrenal intends toraise blood
pressure, Ibegan explaining theeffects ofsaltand
thyroid tofriends who were over 80. They found
that they slept better, hadmore regular heartbeats,
anddidn't suffer from swollen feetwhen they ate
anormal amount ofsalt. Itdidn't cause their
blood pressure torise.
Sodium bicarbonate and sodium cWoride are
known to have diuretic action; sodium

different points todecrease the sodium (and
albumin) intheblood, and toallow ittoenter
tissue cells, ortobelost intheintestine orurine.
Although this dilutional effect ofestrogen onthe
blood issmall, itcertainly increases thetendency
ofwater toenter cells. Especially when combined
\'.ith lactic acid andunsaturated fatty acids,
hotonic soluti imitates theeffects
ofestrogen, andthings that cause tissue leakiness,
such ascholera toxin, actlike estrogen inthe
uterus, the edema itself produced byestrogen
seems tobeacentral ofitsnormal physiologi-
calaction. Histamine and and other
inflammatory s estrogen are
known tocontribute toitsability toproduce
edema. The excess produced under
theinfluence ofestrogen probably contributes to
some edematous, inflammatory, and degenerative
conditions. Since these effects ofestrogen on
tissue water areconsidered tobenongenomic, and
independent tosome extent ofthenormal estrogen
receptors and response elements, any tissue is
probably susceptible toestrogen-induced swelling,
aswell astotheswelling produced byunsaturated
fats and carbon dioxide deficiency. Part ofthe
toxicity ofunsaturated fats could betheir require-
ment ofenergy tobeoxidized (S.Clejan and H.
Schulz, 1986), butthey reduce theefficiency of
energy production inavariety ofother ways.. In
shock (whatever the cause), tissues become
edematous, aswater moves out ofthe blood
stream. The weight oforgans increases tremen-
dously asaresult ofshock. Insevere stress.
shock, and estrogen poisoning, theproduction of
energy isimpaired bytheswelling itself, though it
may have been low energy production that
allowed theshock-state todevelop.
Ifestrogen cancause edema inanytissue, then
antiestrogens, such asprogesterone, canprobably
protect against stress inanytissue.
In the premenstrual syndrome, as in
pregnancy, aprogesterone deficiency can cause
generalized edema. :rom Brewer, who founded

Thyroid, protein, magnesium will
correct most edemas. Progesterone, acting on
mitochondria toincrease respiratory efficiency,
and onstructural proteins tochange their ionic
affinities, synergizes with theother natural factors
tocorrect permeability andwater regulation. One
ofthefirst people Isaw useprogesterone was a
woman who (after being studied atthe Mayo
Clinic and many other places) believed shehad
Bright's disease, and habitually produced an
extremely small quantity ofurine. Afew hours
after taking just afewmilligrams ofprogesterone,
shetelephoned toreport that she"had tostop at
every gasstation ontheway home," because she
was forming urine atsuch agreat rate. mcreased
perfusion ofthekidneys isoneofprogesterone's
normal functions, that accounts foritsability to
prevent orcure "toxemia" ofpregnancy. Besides
itsability toincrease blood perfusion ofthe
kidneys (and other organs), progesterone has an
important role inmineral regulation, since itacts

Although there are complex theories about

oxygen consumption and anunusually high
carbon dioxide concentration, ici-
pates intheformation ofurine. Acetazolamide,
aninhibitor oftheen...ryme carboDlc any rase,
isknown toincrease the body's retention of
carbon dioxide, and issometimes used to
increase thefonnation ofurine, though itsmore
important uses areintheprevention ofedema of
thelungs and brain in"mountain sickness" (a
result ofhyperventilation), andtoreduce swelling
oftheeyes inglaucoma. Itisalso used toprevent
sleep apnea, bycorrecting thealkalosls thatcauses
it. Iheirihibition ofcarbonic anhydrase causes
carbon dioxide retention, and this can produce
acidosis. Intracellular acidosis hasmany impor-
tant cell-protecting effects. By reducing the
ionization ofthecell's macromolecules, thecell's
affinity forwater isdecreased.
Sodium bicarbonate isamore active diuretic
than sodium cWoride. Ithink this hastodowith
carbon dioxide's special properties, including its
relative lipophilicity (preferential solubility inoils
orcells), anditschemical combination with water.
Since saltrestriction isthecommonest way to
trytocorrect edema, it'simportant tothink about
.the physiological reasoning and evidence that
support that common practice. Inphysiology lab
classes, professors sometimes have one group of
students drink aquart ofordinary water atthe
beginning oftheclass, while another group drinks
aquart ofisotonic saline (containing rougWy a
rounded teaspoonful ofsalt). Everyone measures
their urine output over thenext fewhours, andby
theendoftheclass, itturns outthat those who
drank theplain water produced about aquart more
urine than those who drank the slightly salty
pressure, swelling, etc., but researchers have
surprisingly little interest inthatsystem ..)
Brain edema causes seizures, lung edema
causes "respiratory distress syndrome," and isa
factor inpulmonary hypertension. Intheheart and
blood vessels, itincreases rigidity anddecreases
theefficiency ofblood circulatoin. Degenerative
nerve and muscle diseases often begin with
edema; degenerative spinal disks, and lens
cataracts, areproduced byanexcess ofwater.
Although estrogen increases during acute
sickness inboth men andwomen, women have a
higher incidence ofestrogen-related diseases than
men do. Inspite ofalarge number ofdegenera-
tive diseases c-ll.used byestrcgen, women live
significantly longer than men do,andboth animal
andhuman studies have shown that itisprobably
progesterone which gives women thisadvantage.
Itisthisfemale longevity thathasallowed the
drug companies tosuggest that estrogen can
prevent degenerative diseases. Estrogen's known
promotion ofclotting diseases, edema, diabetes,
liver disease andblood pressure abnormalities, are
ignored while cholesterol isemphasized asa"risk
factor" that isfavorably influenced byestrogen.
Estrogen's elevation offree fatty acids, and the
edema produced bythese, areignored asifthey
hadnosignificance inthedegenerative diseases.
Ihave already written about estrogen's contri-
butions tobrain aging andblood clotting diseases,
butIplan towrite soon about progesterone and
