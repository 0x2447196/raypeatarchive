The GABA system, defenses,
and tissue renewal
Inhibition isanactive process, that isn't
limited totheeffects ofspecific inhibitory
nerves. Inrecent decades, theamino acids
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and
glycine (alpha-aminoacetic acid) have been
identified as"inhibitory transmitters," acting
onspecific receptor proteins toinhibit anerve
ormuscle.
This hasledtoincreasing understanding of
some sedative and anti-convulsive drugs, but
itneglects therealbiological nature ofinhibi-
tion andexcitation. The amino acid "transmit-
ters" arejust part ofamuch larger system of
cellregulation.
Tounderstand healing and regeneration
and other developmental and formative
processes Ithink it'snecessary toconsider the
issues ofcellular andorganismic stability and
instability, inhibition and excitation, inthe
most thorough andgeneral way.
Cell interactions generally involve mutual
stabilization. Nerves stabilize muscles,
muscles stabilize nerves, andnerves stabilize
other nerves. Losing their normal intercellular
communications, cells become hypersensitive
andhyperactive.
When anexcess ofstimulation threatens to
damage atissue, processes ofinhibition can
restore stability. Butwhen cells aredamaged
irreparably, stimulation caninduce other cells
togrow andmultiply toreplace thelostcells.
The growth continues until inhibitory
processes arerestored.Protective inhibition isone ofthemost
important principles inbiology. Heart disease,
cancer, anxiety, allergies, epilepsy, degenera-
tive nerve diseases, endocrine disorders,
The agents ofprotective inhibition
increase survival, along with mental
abilities and metabolic rate. Too often the
excitants suppress energy production
while increasing the need for energy,
leading toimpaired functions and failure
ofrestorative processes.
inappropriate inflammation and shock all
involve defects ofprotective inhibition.
Forthousands ofyears people have under-
stood thevalue ofherbal sedatives, soporifics,
and anti-convulsants, butmodem neurology's
ideological commitments have retarded the
scientific development oftherapies toenhance
protective inhibition.
J.C.Bose, working inEngland andIndia at
theendofthe19th century (radio, microwave,
vegetable electricity, theelectric response of
inorganic substances), showed thatplant cells
and animal cells have very similar reactions,
and that similar processes ofexcitation,
fatigue, andrecovery also occur insubstances
such asmetal. Drugs and poisons could be
shown tohave effects onplant material and
metals, *analogous totheir effects onanimals.
*Michael Polanyi's work with crystals inthe
1920s showed that merely wetting asurface
affected thephysical properties ofthe whole
crystaL
His understanding ofsensitivity, irritability,
fatigue, memory and other biological
processes disturbed theacademic biologists,
who were committed to acertain biological
doctrine inwhich membrane electricity and
genes explained everything, and had nothing
directly .todowith general properties of
matter.
C.S. Sherrington inEngland, and S.
Ramon yCajal andR.Lorente deNoinSpain
developed theidea ofthesynapse asapoint of
interaction between nerve cells, which formed
thebasis forreflexes. Anerve would transmit
itsexcitation toamuscle oranother nerve in
anall-or-none manner, that is,thereaction, if
ithappened atall,didn't correspond tothe
strength ofthestimulation. The reductionist
ideology was already, atthebeginning ofthe
20th century, reducing biological interactions
tosimple yesorno,black orwhite, terms. The
infinite complexity ofthematerial substrate
was eliminated from direct participation inthe
scheme oflifebydefmition.
Like Descartes, Sherrington and his
followers saw reflexes assomething separate
from consciousness. "Between reflex
[automatic] action andmind there seems tobe
.actual opposition. Reflex action and mind
seem almost mutually exclusive -themore
reflex thereflex, theless does mind accom-
pany it.""The mental action liesburied inthe
brain, and inthat part most deeply recessed
from outside world that isfurthest from input
andoutput."
Later inthe20th century, biologists were
still identifying consciousness with graded
processes, that aretoosubtle tobeaccounted
forbytheall-or-none synaptic interactions of
nerves.
In1863, I.M. Sechenov had already
published abook, Reflexes ofthe Brain,
arguing thatallaspects ofthemind, including
thoughts andfeelings, directly involve nervous
activity.2
ARussian biologist, Vvedensky (1902),
demonstrated that weak stimuli and strong
stimuli applied toanerve produced very
different effects inthemuscle activated bythe
nerve. "Wedensky [German spelling) found
thatatacertain stage inthefatigue ornarcosis
ofamuscle-nerve preparation, aseries of
strong orrapidly recurring stimuli may
produce asmall initial contraction only
(Anfangszuckung), whereas aseries ofweak
orslowly recurring stimuli produce acontin-
ued tetanus." (JPhysiol. 1913 July 18;
46(4-5): 384-412. Wedensky inhibition in
relation tothe' all-or-none' principle innerve.
E.D.Adrian.)
Another Russian biologist, P.N. Nasonov,
using avariety ofcelltypes, including algae,
showed that anexcessive stimulation that
weakened acell's ability torespond electri-
cally also weakened itsresistance toother
environmental factors, andthattheright kind
ofstimulation could increase thecells' resis-
tance to stress. These ideas were expanded
and applied tohuman health issues bythe
cardiologist F.Z.Meerson, whose laboratory
investigated the protective and therapeutic
effects ofthecomplex multi-level inhibitory
anti-stress system.
The Sherrington tradition, the synapse-
membrane all-or-none school ofneurology,
was complemented bythehormone-receptor-
gene-activation school ofendocrinology, and
byparallel reductionist approaches toembry-
ology. None ofthese traditions produced
anything useful, except inthesense that the
receptor doctrine was perfectly suited to
pharmaceutical advertising.
The all-or-nothing reflex doctrine
reinforced aninterpretation ofthe cell in
which abarrier membrane atthecellsurface
momentarily opens when it'sappropriately
stimulated, allowing excluded sodium ions to
enter, modifying the electrical field and
causing areaction that "propagates along the
nerve like aline offalling dominoes." As
Gilbert Ling haspointed out,thatdoctrine isn't
based onrealscience-- forexample, theresting
membrane doesn't exclude sodium ions. Many
things account forthefactthatitcontinues to
betaught, butIhave talked about thatprevi-
ously. The fact that "membrane
depolarization" makes iteasy toconceptualize
propagation oftheexcited state asanall-or-
none process appeals tothe reductionist
mentality. Butmore than 70years ago, A.V.
Hill's measurements ofheat production during
nerve activity demonstrated that thewave of
excitation passes through theentire substance
ofanerve, rather than being amatter of
"falling dominoes" inthesuperficial plasma
membrane.
It isinthe substance ofthe nerve
cytoplasm itself that theprotective inhibitory
processes occur. Intheall-or-none membrane
theory inwhich reflexes areproduced by
synaptic events, theinhibitory GABA recep-
torsaredescribed asmembrane receptors. The
basic theory ofmembrane receptors isthat,
since themembrane isabarrier, thereceptor
allows hormones ortransmitter molecules to
actonthecellwithout having toenter thecell.
Butwhen amolecule resembling aninhibi-
tory steroid wasmade water soluble, sothatit
couldn't enter cells, itwas unable toactivate
the GABA receptor associated with the
membrane. When itwas presented tothe
receptor from thecytoplasmic side, however,
itwas able tomodify theGABA receptor.
(Akk, etaI.,2005.) The normal oilsoluble
neurosteroids tend toremain inthecells when
they aremade there, ortoenter them sponta-
neously from thebloodstream, sothepostu-
lated function of"membrane receptors" would
seem tobewrong. The GABA receptor has
been found toassociate with the internal
cytoskeletal proteins. This issignificant,
because theglutamate transporter, thatpartici-
pates inrestoring inhibition, hasrecently been3
found tobeassociated with acytoskeletal
protein (GFAP) (Sullivan, etaI.,2007). This
protein isknown tobe induced by
progesterone.
The membrane theory isanattempt to
explain thecoordination ofevents thathappen
inacellwhen itisstimulated. The different
phases ofheat change observed byHill and
others subsequently canonly beexplained asa
phase change inthe bulk ofthe cellular
substance, notjust aripple inasuperficial
lipid film. Different molecular conformations
and associations have different levels of
organization, thatrepresent structural energy,
and different arrangements areseparated by
small energy barriers. Mutual stabilization of
molecular systems gives way toacooperative
.phase transition and theestablishment ofa
new organization ataslightly different energy
level when stimulation overcomes theenergy
barrier. The domino analogy isinadequate
because the change isthree dimensional.
Proteins, lipids, sugars, water andions partici-
pate inthese cooperative structural changes.
Astudent ofPavlov's, P.K. Anokhin,
discussed avariety ofreasons forbelieving
that the information transmitted bythe
activated state ofanaxon wascomplex, rather
than asingle binomial bit.Since histime
many kinds ofinformation have supported and
enriched that view. Cellular interactions are
always complex, andtheall-or-none reflex is
anextremely misleading abstraction.
Drugs and natural regulatory substances
associate with certain proteins, and those
proteins areidentified astheir "receptors."
Since thetechnique of"knocking-out" the
genes forspecific receptors hasbeen devel-
oped, ithasbecome apparent thattheregula-
tory substances areoften able toactwithout
theprotein thathadbeen known astherecep-
tor.(For example, Reddy andApanites, 2005.)
Other proteins may then beidentified as
additional receptors. Occasionally, the
condition ofthephospholipids andfatty acids,
orthepreceding state ofthecell, isrecognized
ashaving acrucial role inthecell's response.
Butthisholistic view hasn't been useful tothe
phannaceutical industry.
Interacting cells are participating ina
developmental process, inwhich their struc-
tures and metabolisms are regulating
themselves inrelation totheir situation, which
isinfluenced byevents inthelifeofthewhole
organism. An organism's anticipation and
learning contribute totherenewal oftissues
and resistance tostress. Unavoidable stress
damages orkills nerve cells, andtheresulting
mobilization ofdefenses can lead either to
successful defense andrecovery, orinadequate
defense andchronic disease.
Once theprotective function ofinhibition
isrecognized, there aremany things that can
bedone tosupport theorganism's recuperative
processes.
Pavlov andhisfollowers began applying
the principle ofprotective inhibition to
medicine, andithasbeen used totreat neuro-
ses, brain injuries (even "brain death"), and
various organic diseases. Pavlov observed that
individual differences innervous stability
could cause thetherapeutic dose ofasedative
tovary several-fold. Prolmiged sleep was
found tobeavery powerful therapy, that
could even reverse age-related changes, but
drugs such ast.he barbiturates were tootoxic
forextensive useofthetherapy. Sleep induc-
tion byelectrical brain stimulation was inves-
tigated as an alternative. Subsequently,
Meerson's group investigated themetabolic
andbiochemical factors involved inprotective
inhibition. Although Meerson's research
focused ontheheart, thefactors heidentified
apply toother organs andtissues. Theprogres-
sive commercialization ofmedical research,
however, has submerged those integrated
organisniic approaches totherapy.4
Using thegeneral approach ofPavlov and
Meerson, it'snow possible toachieve ahigh
degree ofprotective inhibition without using
toxic drugs, butit'simportant tominimize the
chronic factors that create asusceptibility to
uncontrolled excitatory states.
The toxic effects ofexcessive stimulation
involve suppression ofrespiratory energy
production. Excitation releases fatty acids
from tissue phospholipids, andthepolyunsatu-
rated fatty acids (PUFA) increase excitation,
decrease theinhibitory actions oftheGABA
system, and interfere with energy production
bythemitochondria, leading tothewasteful
conversion ofglucose tolactic acid. Excita-
tion increases theproduction offree radicals
bythemitochondria themselves (Duan, etaI.,
2007). Just eliminating most PUFAfrom the
dietdecreases therisks ofexcitotoxicity.
DHA and arachidonic acid increase the
excitatory effect ofglutamate onitsreceptor
(Yeh, etaI.,1995), anddecrease theuptake of
glutamate bytheprotein that binds ittostop
theexcitatory process (Yu, etaI.,1986). These
fatscause swelling ofmitochondria andcells,
andincrease vascular permeability. Saturated
fatsdon't have those excitatory effects.
Fish oilsandother omega -3oilsarebeing
promoted astreatment formany diseases,
especially heart disease, arthritis and other
inflammatory diseases, and depression. They
dohave anantiinflammatory effect, atleast in
theshort term, partly associated with their
inhibition ofprostaglandin synthesis, buttheir
antiinflammatory effects have been found to
result from their oxidized products (Chaud-
hary, etaI.,2004), which have many toxic
effects. Although claims aremade regarding
their beneficial effect onthe circulatory
system, there aregood reasons tothink that
they contribute to atherosclerosis (for
example, Wang andOram, 2002, 2005). And
they suppress theimmune system andthyroid
function.
The PDFA (especially theomega -3fatty
acids) spontaneously decompose intoavariety
oftoxins, andarachidonate isalsoenzymically
converted intoprostaglandins, some ofwhich
exacerbate theexcitatory damage (pepicelli, et
aI., 2005); aspirin's neuroprotective effect
(Riepe, etaI.,1997) isprobably partly caused
byinhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Besides
theprostaglandins, other mediators ofinflam-
mation including nitric oxide andinterleukins
areproduced byexcessive excitation, ascells
lose their ability toretain magnesium, andto
control excitatory intracellular calcium.
Nitric oxide, associated with unbalanced
excitation, isinvolved inthenerve damage of
epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkin-
son's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
Huntington's disease. An energy deficit
increases excitation and cellular calcium
uptake, increasing nitric oxide synthesis
(Schulz, etaI.,1997). Nitric oxide increases
theratio ofglutamate toGABA ("the excito-
toxicity index"), (Demchenko &Piantadosi,
2006), while lowering mitochondrial energy
production.
The PDFAincrease thesusceptibility to
excessive serotonin inthenervous system.
One ofthefunctions oftheGABA system is
toinhibit serotonergic nerves (Calogero, etaI.,
1988; Kaura, etaI.,2007). Eating adietwith a
very low tryptophan content, and lacking
PDFA,cansupport thatfunction oftheGABA
system. The tea amino acid, theanine,
suppresses serotonin bysupporting theeffects
ofGABA. Three ofthemajor types ofantide-
pressant also protect against
glutamate/aspartate-induced nitric oxide
formation andnerve cell damage (Li, et.aI.,
2006).
It'simportant nottoconfuse theprocess of
inhibition with psychological depression,
which often involves aninability toinhibit the
stress responses. The GABA system restrains
theproduction ofcortisol, which istypically5
increased indepression. GABA-supporting
drugs thathadbeen used totreat epilepsy are
turning out tohave antidepressive, mood-
elevating effects.
The diazepam type ofantianxiety, antisei-
zure drug activates theGABA system, and
this system isintimately involved with the
synthesis ofsteroids. Several varieties ofthat
type ofsedative increase thesynthesis ofthe
neurosteroids, derived from progesterone.
Progesterone and some ofitsmetabolites
protect themitochondria, while acting with
GABA toincrease thestate ofinhibition.
During themenstrual cycle, theGABA
system isweaker during estrus, when estro-
gen's effect ishigh. Progesterone isassociated
with ahigher level ofGABA, and thetwo
substances have many ofthesame effects on
behavior.
Estrogen's excitatory effects canbeseen in
alltypes oftissue. Inthebrain, ittends to
increase physical activity and loquacity, to
increase the susceptibility toseizures, and
sometimes tocause chorea, involuntary
random jerking andwrithing movements.
Itisantagonistic totheGABA system, and

and increases formation ofnitric oxide and
prostaglandins. Incancers that arepromoted
byestrogen, GABA, likeprogesterone, inhib-
itscelldivision. Itisanantiproliferative agent
innormal tissues, too, opposing estrogen's
effects andsupporting progesterone's.
Drugs (such aspiracetam) that promote
GABA's effects arecalled "nootropins," or
cognitive enhancers, and have been used to
treat brain damage and mental retardation.
GABAergic agents also protect thethymus
gland andimprove immune functions.
The first serious approach ofthepharma-
ceutical industry totreating Alzheimer's
disease was based onincreasing theexcitatory
action ofacetylcholine. When itbccame
apparent that those drugs weren't helpful,
there was alesspublicized trial ofsome drugs
thatblock theeffects ofacetylcholine. Ifwhite
doesn't work, they try black. The industry's
function, exercised through medical and
science journals, and medical schools and
universities, istosellnew products, andthat
hasoften made itnecessary fortheindustry to
suppress approaches that would make their
products unnecessary. Asthehead ofadrug
company told me, adrug that cures quickly
isn't agood drug; agood drug isonethat the
patient hastokeep taking fortherestofhis
life.
Progesterone's inhibitory function was
already well established inthe1940s, bythe
work ofSelye andLipshutz, forexample. In
the1950s and1960s itseffects onbrain devel-
opment and intelligence were established. In
vitro studies showed that itwas anerve
growth factor, and itwas identified asa
that caused new brain cells to
develop inanarea ofbirds' brains astheir
ability tosing developed. Katherina Dalton's
clinical experience supported theanimal work
which showed thatprenatal exposure tohigher
levels ofprogesterone improved mental
functioning later inlife.
Progesterone supplementation can
sometimes cause complete recovery from
dementia andmotor neuron diseases.
After many years ofanimal experiments
showing thatprogesterone promotes recovery
from traumatic brain damage (Cutler, etaI.,
2007; Stein, 2007), itisnow being used to
treat people following severe brain injury
(Wright, etaI.,2007).
Neither progesterone norGABA stimulates
cellmultiplication, yetthey improve theregen-
erative process. Their effects aretheresult of
preventing premature cell death, andpromot-
ingnormal differentiation and maturation. In
various kinds ofdegenerative brain disease,
theconnective tissue glial cells inthebrain
become toonumerous, while thenerve cells6
decline. Excitatory processes cause new cells
tobeformed, and with theproper energetic
and inhibitory support the new cells can
mature intofunctional nerves, thatmaintain or
restore theexisting systems andfunctions.
Certain kinds ofexcitation cause new
nerve cells tobeformed (neurogenesis). The
enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid
(phospholipase A2, which also releases
docosahexaenoic acid DHA) from tissue
structures, creates atype ofphospholipid that
isslightly more water-soluble and mobile
because oftheremoval ofthat fatty acid.
These arecalled lysophospholipids, because
they were originally identified asasubstance
that lysed redblood cells. The enzymes that
produce them areactivated bymany things,
including freeradicals, increased calcium, and
theshift ofbalance toward excitation (Birkle,
1992), away from dominance oftheGABA
system.
The lysophospholipids stimulate, among
other things, neurogenesis (Fukushima, 2004;
Harada, 2004; Ishii, etaI.,2003; Dubin, etaI.,
1999). Thearachidonic acid thatisliberated in
itsformation excites cells, inaprocess that
cangetoutofcontrol iftheinhibitory GABA
system isweak. Itcanproduce gliosis from
excessive stimulation of cell division
combined with alack ofthefactors such as
GABA needed formaturation intonerve cells,
anditcankillnerve cells, byinterrupting their
energy production. The accumulation ofthis
and related fatty acids with aging isa
problem.
The DHA andother polyunsaturated fatty
acids released bycellular excitation cause
mitochondrial damage and edema, but
saturated fatty acids don't have those effects
(Chan andFishman, 1980, 1982; Chan, etaI.,
1988; Hillered andChan, 1988, 1989).
Alexis Carrel, with afamous experiment
begun in1912, showed that animal tissues
kept inculture dishes with frequent (daily)
changes ofthegrowth medium didn't age, and
hesuggested that changes inthefats inthe
body accounted foraging. Lately thegene-
technology people have said fraud was
involved inCarrel's experiments, butmany
other kinds ofexperiment produced similar
results. Forexample, Hans Selye found that
frequent changes offluid prevented aging of
tissue growing inside animplanted capsule.
Polezhaev's discovery that mammalian
tissues canbeinduced toregenerate bythe
presence ofdegenerating tissue (which
releases the breakdown products of
phospholipids andproteins) isconsistent with
the recent demonstrations that stem cell
growth isactivated byfatty acids and
phospholipids.
The saturated fats, rather than simply
lacking thetoxic andexcitatory properties of
thepolyunsaturated fats, arebeing shown by
many types ofresearch tohave protective,
inhibitory, andrestorative actions.
The medium chain triglycerides (MCT,
usually made from coconut oil) areeasily
oxidized bymitochondria, andareoften used
toproduce ketosis, toprevent seizures. A
high-fat diethasbeen used since about 1920 to
control epilepsy, but there isnogenerally
accepted explanation for its effect. A
ketogenic dietproduces acetone, acetoacetate,
and beta-hydroxybutyrate ("ketone bodies")
.andthese areprotective against seizures (Rho,
etaI.,2002). Besides providing energy to
mitochondria, hydroxybutyrate isstructurally
close toGABA. Other close analogs, gamma-
hydroxybutyrate, gamma-butyrolactone, and
1,4-butanediol, clearly act asregulatory
substances, rather than asmere energy
sources, though mitochondrial energy supply
isanimportant issue inseizures. Even acetate
itself isprotective (Urion,etaI.,1979).
Afeature common tomany antiseizure
chemicals isaseries ofsaturated carbon
atoms, for example valproic acid7
(2-propylpentanoic), valeric acid (pentanoic
acid), dipropylacetic acid, isoleucine
(2-amino-3-methylpentanoic acid), leucine
(2-arnino-4-methylpentanoic acid).
The main difference between metabolism
ofglucose andmetabolism offatforenergy is
that fatcan't bemetabolized into lactic acid,
while glucose andfatcanboth bemetabolized
tocarbon dioxide. When mitochondria are
damaged, cells compensate byproducing and
excreting lactic acid.
Alzheimer's disease hasbeen described as
"diabetes ofthebrain," because thedemented
brain uses glucose and oxygen very slowly.
Theeasily metabolized medium chain triglyc-
erides can improve mental functions in
Alzheimer's patients (Reger, etaI.,2004).
Although diabetes isdescribed asan
inability touseglucose, diabetics usually have
increased lactate intheir blood, indicating that
glucose isbeing used wastefully, atthesame
time that some energy isproduced from fat.
Mitochondria damaged bychronic exposure to
PDFA have a low rate ofoxygen useand
energy production.
Inoldage, and sometimes inyounger
people, mitochondria losesome oftheir DNA,
andareunable toproduce theproteins needed
forfullmetabolic activity. Inyounger people,
atype ofmitochondrial defect causes seizures
andlactic acidosis. The production oflactic
acid tends toraise the intracellular pH
(especially when carbon dioxide isn't being
produced) while ittends tolower theblood's
pH. High intracellular pHisexcitatory. The
"genetically" defective mitochondria canbe
replaced bygenetically normal mitochondria
iftheketone bodies areprovided (Santra, et
aI.,2004). Asimilar restoration ofnormal
mitochondria canbeachieved inoldpeople's
muscles through aprogram of"concentric"
contractions.
Other GABAergic agents are able to
functionally restore damaged mitochondria,
butinthese studies, thequality oftheDNA
wasn't investigated. Piracetam intensifies
oxygen consumption in .damaged
mitochondria, forexample following injury or
oxygen deprivation, especially inolder
animals. The restoration ispermanent, soin
this case thesubstance isn't acting just asa
more easily metabolized source ofenergy, as
was believed tobe the mechanism inthecase
oftheketone body supplement.
Many people still believe that increasing
oxygen consumption necessarily increases free
radical activity andshortens thelife-span, and
that thelife extension produced bycaloric
restriction results from reduced oxygen
consumption. The fact that estrogen
suppresses mitochondrial oxygen consumption
isbeing used tojustify using ittotreat aging
and dementia. But caloric restriction doesn't
reduce oxygen consumption per gram of
tissue, andsometimes increases it.Uncoupling
mitochondria, sothat they consume more
energy without producing more ATP,appears
toproduce anextension oflifespan approxi-
mately equal totheincreased rate ofenergy
and oxygen consumption (data discussed in
Speakman, 2003). Increasing themetabolic
rate haseffects similar torestricting calories.
Supplementing thyroid, increasing saturated
fatssuch asMCT andcoconut oil,andrestrict-
ing fats, can increase the
metabolic rate.
Piracetam (like other GABAergic agents)
very effectively decreases lipid peroxidation
(Novikov, etaI., 1996), despite increasing
metabolic activity. While decreasing oxidative
damage and increasing ATPproduction, it
also lowers theactivity ofthecells' important
antioxidant enzymes (Keil, etaI.,2006). When
acell isn't being damaged, those adaptive
enzymes aren't required tobesoactive. (Many
publications argue that certain products are
"beneficial because they increase the
antioxidant enzymes," butinfact almost any8
kind ofinjury will increase those protective
enzymes.)
Ifmitochondria aren't damaged, for
example inhealthy young animals, piracetam
doesn't greatly increase their activity. Itsimply
restores them when they aredamaged.
The mitochondria, besides producing
energy and regulating calcium and other
minerals, arethesource oftheGABAergic
steroids. Since mitochondria contain "valium
receptors" orGABA receptors, their high
concentration intheregion ofsynapses has
probably sometimes been interpreted as
showing "membrane receptors." Butwherever
they are,mitochondria arepowerful agents of
cellular interactions andregulation.
The carbon dioxide produced by
mitochondria isinvolved inregulating ions
and cellular electrical polarization, and
protecting against freeradicals. Theenergized
and polarized cell retains magnesium and
potassium, andexcludes sodium andcalcium.
Increasing magnesium favors theprotective
inhibitory state, andissometimes given intra-
venously tostop seizures. Adequate sodium in
thediet isnecessary forefficient retention of
magnesium, and sodium isalso required for
thebinding ofglutamate. Lithium canreplace
sodium inactivating glutamate removal
(Menaker, etaI.,2006), and itprotects the
brain against excitotoxicity (Chuang, 2004).
Breathing carbon dioxide hasbeen used to
stop seizures, and thedrug, acetazolamide,
which increases thebody's retention ofC02,
issometimes used forepilepsy. Increased
carbon dioxide protects thebrain against a
variety offactors (e.g., Simon, etaI.,1993),
andisprobably involved inglutamate uptake.
Niacinamide, one ofthe Bvitamins, .
happens tohave GABAergic sedative activity,
butitalso hastwo other important effects. It
can suppress lipolysis and lower circulating
free fatty acids, reducing their interference
with the use ofglucose, and when the
mitochondria are already damaged, itcan
reduce theformation oflactic acid, byallow-
ingthesugar tobefully oxidized. Forming the
coenzyme NAD, niacin isresponsible for
maintaining anappropriate balance between
oxidation andreduction (asthemain cellular
reductant), protecting cells from oxidative
stress. (Shen, etaI.,2003; Singh, etaI.,2005;
Kang, etai.,2006; Watanabe, etai.,2006;
Kao, etaI.,2007; Su,etaI.,2007). Thegluta-
mate transporter must bekept inthereduced
state tobind glutamate andstop theexcitatory
process (Trotti, etaI.,1997).
Maintaining anadequate supply ofglucose
isdirectly protective against excitotoxicity
(e.g., Flavin, etaI.,1993), andhelps toprevent
stress reactions systemically.
Thyroid hormone (which hasareciprocal
relation toestrogen) produces many relaxant
effects, such asrapid relaxation after the
Achilles tendon reflex contraction, reduced
blood pressure, and deeper sleep, but its
supportive effects ontheGABA system are
seldom considered inrelation totherapies. Itis
essential forproducing carbon dioxide, the
neurosteroids, and ATP. Magnesium is
retained incells largely byitsassociation with
ATP,andithelps tokeep theATPlevel high.
Thyroid isneeded forpreventing excessive
estrogen stimulation, and for controlling
adrenaline andserotonin. But italso directly
interacts with theGABA system, supporting
theprotective inhibitory functions (Zamoner,
etaI.,2006; Gilbert, etaI.,2007; Ortiz-Butron,
etaI.,2003).
Inhibitors ofestrogen synthesis arebeing
considered foruse incontrolling epilepsy
(Reddy, 2007), butaspirin andprogesterone
andthyroid canproduce similar results.
When mitochondria arefunctioning fully,
either glucose or saturated fats can safely
provide energy. Some glucose orsaturated fat
canbeconverted topolyunsaturated fats, that
can beused asregulators orsignals, for9
example toactivate theformation ofstem
cells. Butthose PUPAdon't create disruptive
cascades ofincreasing excitation orinflamma-
tion orexcessive growth, and, from the
evidence ofanimals thatarefedfatfreediets,
ordiets lacking omega -3andomega -6fatty
acids, they aren't toxic tomitochondria.
When ahealthy cell isexcited, the
mitochondria become more active, andtheir
energy needs may exceed the amount of
glucose available, leading totheformation of
ketone bodies. Glucose deprivaticrn seems to
beafundamental signal ofstress, and the
formation ofketone bodies ispossibly the
most primitive defensive reaction tostress.
They protect nerves from excitatory oxidative
damage (Noh, etaI.,2006), inhibit mitochon-
drial production ofreactive oxygen species
during excitation (Maalouf, etaI.,2007) and
inhibit tumor growth and lactate production
(Magee, etaI., 1979). Increased thyroid
hormone canincrease ketone formation (Riou,
etaI.,1980; Bartels andSestoft, 1980).
The idea ofsynaptic membrane receptors
often leads people tothink ofcellular inhibi-
tion interms ofraising acell's threshold for
producing anall-or-none membrane response
tostimulation. Buttheinhibitory andexcita-
tory systems interact atalllevels offunction
and structure, reciprocally modifying each
other.
Inresponse tosignals forexcitation or
inhibition, forexample, thequantity ofGABA
andGABAergic steroids such asprogesterone
will change, inresponse toincreases or
decreases ,intheenzymes that produce or
eliminate them, andchanges inconcentrations
ofprecursor molecules. The quantity and
sensitivity ofthevarious types of"receptor"
will change. Proteins thatbind andinactivate
GABA and other regulators will change in
quantity andeffectiveness. The rate atwhich
energy isproduced willchange, along with the
rates of cellular reconstruction and
decomposition. The cells' metabolic changes
will produce signals thataffect adjoining cells
and theorganism's physiological processes,
including circulation, respiration, and readi-
ness forstress.
Inthe "normal" course ofaging, good
tissues atrophy, andmay bepartly replaced by
fibrotic tissues, and inthat environment,
tumors anddisorganized structures ofvarious
kinds develop. The highs andlows, thedaily
cycles ofmental andphysical activity, tend to
beleveled, astheability toproduce metabolic
energy declines.
The polyunsaturated fats suppress energy
.production, andthatsuppression isaggravated
bytheir excitatory orinflammatory effects,
which lead toincreased excitation byother
intrinsic factors such asestrogen, cytokines,
serotonin, andpeptide hormones, thatintensify
theproblem ofmaintaining energy production.
Stimulation, without corresponding appropri-
ateinhibition andadequate energy, skews the
path ofdevelopment, toward aging and
sickness.
When each cell isfully energized and
stabilized, itissensitive andresponsive toits
surroundings, supporting the organism's
adaptability .
Although caffeine isastimulant that can
offset thesedative effects ofGABA, italso
functions as.aneuroprotectant, protecting
against some oftheeffects ofglutamate (Chino-
poulos, etal.,2004). Itisalsoavery good source
oftwoother protective factors, magnesium and
niacin. "French-roast" (dark) coffee isan
especially richsource ofniacin, which might be
responsible forthe"French paradox," thelow
incidence ofheart disease inacountry thatdoesn't
follow theAHA's "heart protective diet."
