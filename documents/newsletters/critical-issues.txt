Critical Issues
People often ask me what I think of
particular medical or biological articles, withthe implication that, because it was publishedin a professional journal, it’s  worth consider-ing. Skepticism about the statements ofgovernment officials and advertisers hasincreased in recent years, but I think mostpeople still think there’s something differentabout “science” publications. 
In recent years, recognizing that they had
credibility problems resulting from “lapses inintegrity” or “unintentional bias associatedwith industry funding” (such as the SSRIfraud; Healy, et al., 2018), most medicaljournals now require their authors to submitstatements about their financial conflicts ofinterest. Most editors, however, don’t makesuch public statements about their ownconflicts of interest, and the conflicts of inter-ests of the referees, who evaluate the work, arerarely disclosed. The major publishers ofjournals are in the business to make a profit,and the editors’ jobs depend on pleasing thepublishers. Medical journals that sell advertis-ing are in a position similar to that of thetelevision networks, which usually can’t affordto report critically on products they advertise.They do, however, like to publish derogatoryinformation about the unadvertised cheap alter-
natives to their advertised products. The profitfrom selling reprints of a single article toa drug company to use in promoting sales canexceed a million dollars.Richard Smith, a former editor of The BMJ
(formerly the British Medical Journal ), has
said “. . . it took me almost a quarter ofcentury editing for the BMJ to wake up towhat was happening” (Smith, 2005).     
Occasionally, editorial staffs have broken
away from corrupt publishers to start a newjournal. A new organization, to makepublished health-related information openlyaccessible to the public, the Public Library ofScience, now produces open access publica-tions, with free access and unrestricted reuse,as long as the author and original source areproperly cited. This was a big step towardreducing the corrupting influence of corporatemoney in medicine. 
The holistic, constitutional
approach to cancer and otherproblems is constantly beingattacked, in the effort to create acultural landscape in which theonly acceptable science is mecha-nistic, molecular, and genetic.
Besides the actual money and gifts, there
are other very powerful influences that impairobjectivity, for example, a researcher’sconsideration of the effects that a particularconclusion will have on the person’s profes-sional prestige, or its effects on his political orreligious involvements.  These considerations
of power, prestige, and money affect not justRay Peat's Newsletter

Not for republication without written permission.published work in science, but also university
administrators and professors and the contentof university courses. Quid pro quo  corruption
can be identified and, to some extent corrected,for example by the Open Access movement,and by exposure of the s ometimes shady finan-
cial arrangements of that movement, as thelibrarian Jeffery Beall has done, but the antisci-entific effects of cultural and professionalinvolvements require a different kind of criti-cal analysis, and as a result are seldom noticed,allowing their devastating effects to persist.
The editors of journals, whose objectivity
may be questionable, choose the usuallyanonymous referees to evaluate the submittedwork, so the reader who wants to think aboutthe evidence that’s being discussed has toconsider the effects that those layers of person-ality—the funder, the researcher-writer, thejudge, and the editor-publisher—have on thefacts, the concepts, and the language. 
Every word has its history and its locality,
every sentence and paragraph has its personal-ity. Any objectivity can only be discovered bytaking into account as much of the subjectivityas possible.  The style of writing in sciencejournals is explicitly intended to depersonalizelanguage, to give the impression ofobjectivity.  That is a propaganda technique,that contributes nothing to scientificobjectivity. 
Fear of terrorism and fear of
disease are marketing tools.
Freedom to do research is restricted by
many of the same forces that shapepublication. The people who control the instru-ments and materials needed for investigatingcertain problems routinely restrict access tothem to people who are known to be loyal tothe ruling beliefs. For example, the US AtomicEnergy Commission chose Elwood Jensen,with a long history in secret chemical warfareresearch, for exclusive access to radioactively
labeled estrogen, which he used to demon-strate that estrogen isn’t metabolized in theuterus, supposedly showi ng that it acts only by
inducing expression of  specific genes. The
uterus does  metabolize estrogen , but his
false claim changed the direction of researchin all the fields involving estrogen. 
University administrators hire only the
people who will reliably work on the right sortof problems, and too often those decisions areguided by donor interes ts. Some universities
produce an extremely disproportionate amountof estrogen promoting research, and areenriched accordingly. After I had seen someflagrantly propagandistic statements byprofessors at Yale medical school, I wrote tothe dean, asking how much money theyreceived from the estrogen industry.He declined to tell me, and said my questionwas improper, because it suggested thatmoney might influence the results of scien-tific research.

Our daily “news” contains a blend of
reports of Wars on Terrorism and Wars onVarious Lucrative Diseases, with statementsby eminent Experts and Authorities. Fear ofterrorism and fear of disease are marketingtools. It is advertising for the interlockingsystem of government and corporations, at thesame time that it is reinforcing the attitude thatinformation is hierarchical, that the best infor-mation comes from the top experts, chosen bythe top journalists. The basic message isalways that the system is protecting us.
The recent “novichok” poisonings in
England are a good example of the way themedia and government work together. Thepublic, without the slightest access to any factsabout chemical testing, were told what they2should understand  about the event and the
substance, by the BBC, speaking for the secretpolice agencies and government officials.Critics were carefully excluded from the majormedia. 
Ordinary medical publications are often
treated similarly—for example, the newsnetworks tell us a study has found that fish oil
cures cancer or that asp irin causes cancer, but
to read the details it’s often necessary to pay ascience journal $35 to see the information thatwould let you judge whether thereported conclusion was justified by theevidence. Often the research was subsidized bytaxpayers, including payment of “pagecharges” to the publishing journals.  
Someone sent me an “unedited” prepubli-
cation draft of an accepted manuscript of arecent article on aspirin and melanoma, so Idon’t know whether it’s exactly like thepublished form. Since aspirin has a protectiveeffect against a variety of cancers (Kaiser,2012), it was surprising to see articles on theinternet saying that this new study (Orrell, etal., 2018) found that aspirin causes melanomain men. The authors say “Findings of thisstudy suggest that chronic once dailyaspirin exposure is associated with an overallincreased risk” of mali gnant melanoma in men.
In the context of the text of the article, wherethe authors contrast their results with a previ-ous study that showed prolonged survival inmalignant melanoma patients who usedaspirin, they are clearly suggesting that theirstudy shows that aspirin could cause cancer.Their text doesn’t suggest that they are awareof any reason for the association other than theeffect of aspirin on the organism. However, thedetails in a table describing the people in thestudy make the reason clear
.
It is very well established that the risk of
melanoma (like that of other cancers) increasesexponentially with age, with most of the casesand deaths occurring after the age of 60. Heartdisease has a similar age distribution, with menbeing far more likely than women to suffer
from it, and it is very common toprescribe aspirin to old men to prevent heartattacks (Woods, 1994). When a man gets oldhe is more likely to develop melanoma, and(in the US and a few other countries) alsolikely to be prescribed aspirin—with age,heart disease, and the male gender beingassociated for biological reasons, and the useof aspirin being associated for social (medical)reasons. 
Medical journals that sell adver-
tising are in a position similar tothat of the television networks,which usually can’t afford to reportcritically on products they adver-tise. They do, however, like topublish derogatory informationabout the unadvertised cheap alter-natives to their advertised
products.
In the study, men were 2.5 times more
likely to be prescribed aspirin than women.The average age of the people who weren’tprescribed aspirin was 53.6 years, that of thepeople prescribed aspirin was 69.3 years. Thedecision to prescribe aspirin tended to separateolder men into one group, younger womeninto the other group. The decision to prescribeaspirin was probably associated with malepattern baldness and prostate disease, as wellas with melanoma, because those becomemore likely with age, but no one wouldsuggest that aspirin caused baldness andprostate disease.
There was exactly no difference in the
melanoma rate according to dose of aspirin, 81mg. or 325 mg., but the mean age of theaspirin users who got melanoma was 76.8years, and the mean age of the non-users ofaspirin who got melanoma was 61.6 years.Did taking aspirin delay the appearance of3melanoma for 15 years? The most interesting
thing to me is why a dozen people would wanttheir name on that article. 
The copy I have says “Funding sources:
None.”  Following the title, there is the note :
“... a large, single-center, urban, U.S. patient
population cohort study from the Research onAdverse Drug events And Reports (RADAR)
project ....” According to Wikipedia, “Though
it was without funding for its first fouryears, RADAR has raised about $12 millionthrough grants from the National Institutes ofHealth, the American Cancer Society and other
such institutions. ” 
Aspirin is just one of many cheap generic
substances that have been attacked frequentlyin the medical journals. Around 1980, a friendshowed me an article in JAMA that warnedabout the dangers of vitamin E, with manycitations of research publications. Most of thearticles that the author said showed theharmful effects of vitamin E were actuallyreporting biological changes that the research-ers considered to be beneficial. The author wasconfident that few readers of JAMA weregoing to read the articles he cited.
Some authors and editors apparently trust
that people are going to read no more than thetitle or the abstract, and design those to harmo-nize with the ruling paradigm, though theimpression they give ma y be the exact opposite
of the actual data in the article. Once I askedan author for a reprint of an article whosetitle indicated a brain-protective role for estro-gen, but when I got the article it didn’t discussthat issue. I emailed her, and said I didn’t findthat in the article; she replied, saying that itwas there. After a couple of email exchanges,she gave up, and told me that that was theconsensus of the profession, and that the titlewasn’t her responsibility, anyway. Around thetime she published that article, she had gone towork for a major estrogen producer.
Salt, sugar, saturated fats, coffee, milk,
cholesterol, sunlight, carbon dioxide, andprogesterone are other things that often
receive the attention of
 science propagandists. 
The antiscientific effects of
cultural and professional involve-ments require a different kind ofanalysis, and as a result are seldomnoticed, allowing their devastatingeffects to persist.  
Many dermatologists still recommend the
use of sunscreen loti ons and avoidance of
sunlight, but it’s likely that they are contribut-ing to the continuing increase in malignantmelanoma. A worldwide survey of exposureto ultraviolet radiation in relation to cutaneousmalignant melanoma (CMM) didn’t findevidence anywhere of reddening (sunburn)doses of UVB (the higher energy band ofultraviolet) correlating with CMM. They didfind that “Both Europeans and Americans insome age groups have significant increasingCMM incidences with decreasing UVB dose,which shows UVB is not the main driver inCMM and suggests a possible role for lowercutaneous vitamin D3 levels and UVA(315–400 nm) radiation” (Godar, et al.,2017). 
The production of irrational claims, based
on various types of misle ading experiments, to
justify the use of estrogen supplements hasbeen an important indus try since about 1940.
Slightly later, a subordinate industry hasgrown up around the need to misrepresent anyof the natural substances that act as part of thebody’s defense against estrogen excess andestrogen-like processes. Aspirin, vitamin E,and progesterone can be partly understood asantiestrogenic substances, if the biologicalgenerality of estrogen is recognized, but it isexactly that idea of biological generality(which, in different forms, was the basis ofhistorical medical doctrines) that the drugindustry feels must be suppressed. 4The mechanistic drug ideology came to a
head several years ago in refining the idea ofcancer as a genetic disease, resulting in thescheme of “personalized, targeted, cancertherapy,” in which the unique genetic structureof a person’s cancer became the (extremelyprofitable) basis for choosing a“customized” chemotherapy for that “uniquecancer.” A commercial-academic venture atDuke University was upset, starting in 2012,when the data showing the effectiveness of themethod was found to have been falsified. Onedoctor was judged to have been completelyresponsible for the fraud, but the extremeslowness of the system to acknowledge thatthere was a problem has left its impression.
The idea of personalized, tumor-specific
chemotherapy itself is fraudulent at a deeperlevel, since it’s based on an individuality basedon mutated DNA, while it’s now recognizedthat epigenetic cellular individuality is anon-going process thr oughout the body, involv-
ing continuous changes of the cytoplasm as
well as the nucleus.
Meanwhile, the holistic, constitutional
approach to cancer and other problems isconstantly being attacked, in the effort tocreate a cultural landscape in which the onlyacceptable science is mechanistic, molecular,and genetic. Progester one’s long history of
anti-tumor effects has led to the discovery ofvarious somewhat clever ways to deny thoseeffects. They discovered that if they used a car-
cinogenic-estrogenic-i mmunosuppressive sol-
vent as the vehicle for administering progester-one by injection, they could sometimesovercome and reverse its anticancer effects. 
Until the 1970s, polyunsaturated vegetable
oils, usually with benzyl benzoate or benzylalcohol, were used as a solvent for injectedprogesterone, despite their known cancerpromoting effects. The y have continued to be
used as a solvent for testosterone. Sometimespure benzyl alcohol was  used as the solvent
for injections, but the quick crystallization ofthe progesterone after injection caused
problems. Ethyl alcohol came to be the mainsolvent used for in vitro study of progester-one’s effects, especially with cancer cells.Ethanol is highly soluble in water, so thatwhen a solution of progesterone in ethanol isadded to a culture dish, the ethanol dissolvesin the water, leaving the water-insolubleprogesterone to crystallize. As far as I know,the fate of those crystals hasn’t been investi-gated, but it’s known that ethyl alcohol has ahormonal action, activating the estrogenresponse system (Etique, et al., 2004,Monteiro, et al., 2008, Wong, et al., 2012).
Some authors and editors appar-
ently trust that people are going toread no more than the title or theabstract, and design those to har-monize with the ruling paradigm,though the impression they givemay be the exact opposite of theactual data in the article.
The estrogen so-called receptor can act,
without the presence of estrogen, when thecell is stressed by hypoxi a, ionizing radiation,
or inflammation, allowing things that damagethe cell to supplement whatever estrogen ispresent. Aspirin, vitamin E, and progesteroneprotect against a broad spectrum of harmfulfactors, besides their various antagonisticeffects on the estrogen system itself. One ofprogesterone’s major effects is to suppress ordegrade the “estrogen receptor.” The so-calledprogesterone receptor, however, is induced byestrogen, normally permitting the
 presence of
progesterone to neutralize estrogen’s action.This means that, in the absence of progester-one, its “receptor” is simply part of the estro-gen system, and is unable to neutralizeestrogen. These facts are frequently manipu-lated to support the claim that progesterone5can do what estrogen is known to do, such as
promoting cancer development. 
When a substance or process is important
economically, it’s likely that distorting propa-ganda will obscure objective consideration.Like the cartoons used in television drugadvertising, “hormone receptors” can be usedto tell a simple story, and, with the motivation
of greed, that story is likely to be nothing butfiction.
Political and economic regulatory decisions
are often said to be based on “scientificconclusions.” The foods and the medical treat-ments that are available conform to govern-ment policies. There is no issue of scientificfact that isn’t potentially of vital importance tothe public. Knowledge of objective realityrequires personal invol vement and personal
interests, and to understa nd any particular issue
requires critical understanding of the funda-mental commitments of the people who aremaking the claim of objectivity.
In the 1950s and ’60s, the schools and
media taught the public not to question theexperts, because “they have information thatwe don’t have.” Slowly, the public is realizingthat the failure of the experts’ various warsproves that they didn’t have valid information.
