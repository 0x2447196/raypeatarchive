Severnlyearsagotherewasalotofpublicity
aboutthegreatimprovement intherateof
cancercures inrecentdecades,butsomeone
pointedoutthatthedeathratefromcancer
hadn'timprovedatall. About20years ago,
HarryRubin(anhonestresearcher in
cancer-related matters) pointedoutthatif
youaggressively huntforcancerinany
symptom-free 50year-old person,youare
likelytofindit,sinceautopsies show
identifiablecancercellsineveryone ofthat
age.Ifrefined techniques ofscreening for
cancer(suchaswhole-body MRI)are
developed, wecantheoretically get
extremely high"cure"rateswithout
lowering thedeathrateatall.
Untilrecently, theAmerican Cancer
Societycontinued tobaseitspropaganda
onaweirdprocedure called"age
standardizing on1940,"buttheyhave
stopped that.Thepost-war babyboom
madetheaverage population younger for
afewdecades, butnowthebirth-control
pillismakingtheaveragepopulation older.
Inthissituation, thetrickofcomparing
thedeathTateforchildhood cancerin,for
example, 1950,totheratein1986,would
makeitappearthatchildhood cancerwas
beingdefeated,just asthe1940reference
madeitseemthattherateforoldpeople
hasbeenimproving.
EventheA.C.S.admitsthatradiation
causesleukemia andothercancers, but
theyareapparently notinterested inthe
effectsoffalloutfromnuclearbombtests
ontheleukemiadeath rate.Anyonewhois
surethatchildhood cancerisbeing
conquered bychemotherapy should
consider ErnestSternglass's discussion of
theeffectsofradiation exposure onthe
incidence ofmiscarriages, congenitalhypothyroidism andotherbirthdefects,
leukemia, braincancer, andbrain
development. Sincethe1963agreement to
stopatmospheric testing radiation
exposure hasbeendecreasing, andso1
