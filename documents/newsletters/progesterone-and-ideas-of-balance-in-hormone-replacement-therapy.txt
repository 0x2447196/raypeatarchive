Estrogen's action onmany tissues increases
thetissue's ability tobind estrogen; estrogen
induces its own "receptor," in aself-
stimulating, self-destabilizing process. This is
unlike thebehavior ofother "receptors," such
astheadrenalin receptor, which isinactivated
byincreased exposure toadrenalin. This
unusual interaction between tissue and
hormone requires careful examination.
Forexample, estrogen's immediate effect ona
-responsive tissue is tocause ittotake upwater,
-and toincrease itsratio ofsodium topotassium;
these changes lead todepolarization-activation of
nerve, muscle, and some glandular cells, andof

asthecell's state ofhydration, its"wetness,"
canaccount forthecoherent way inwhich cells
areactivated, with related processes happening
atalllevels, from chromosomes, tomitochon-
dria and enzymes, the structural protein
meshwork ofthe cytoskeleton, and sensory
functions.
Cells usesomething like metaphor oranalogy
(aspreviously discussed inrelation toJ.Cairns'
work, and e.g., inobservations such asthose of
Smith, etal.,1990) toachieve coordination over
long distances, andamedium ofcoordination and
cooperation isneeded; cell water, with itsrich
structural potential, provides thatmedium.
What dothese perspectives imply formedical
practice?
First, that theissue of"estrogen defiiciency"
must beweighed very carefully. 35years ago,
men were given estrogen ''toprotect them from
heart attacks," and the treatment increased the
incidence of heart problems; several new
campaigns are underway touse estrogens to
protect both men and women from heart attacks.
The arguments for"cardioprotective" actions of
estrogen are based onvery peculiarly chosen
"indicators," excluding from consideration estro-
gen's contributory role indiabetes, elevation of
free fatty acids and triglycerides, inthetendency
toclot, synergism with adrenalin inspasticity of
blood vessels, and other conditions relevant to
heart disease. Similar campaigns, contrary to
facts, arebeing developed in"brain protection,"
andother imaginary benefits ofestrogen. Consis-
tently, ithasbeen found that the"positive results"
found among women who take estrogen aren't
scientifically valid, since thegroups were selectedinsuch away that thewomen who took estrogen
were healthier tobegin with than thewomen who
didn't take estrogen.
Inthelight ofsuch imagined protective effects
ofestrogen, supplements arebeing recommended,
either without anymeasurement ofestrogen, oron
thebasis offinding a"low level" ofestrogen,
without taking anyoftheopposing orbalancing
factors into account. The idea of"estrogen
deficiency," like that of"estrogen's protective
action,". iscompletely without scientific founda-
tion.
Any idea ofbalance suggests that there could
beanimbalance ineither direction. The harm
done byunopposed estrogenic stimulation isclear.
Does anexcess ofprogesterone occur, and ifit
does, isitharmful? Animal experiments, in
particular, have made it clear that, atacertain
level, and intheabsence ofinterfering factors,
progesterone's sedative action canreach thelevel
ofdeep anesthesia. When Selye's labtechnicians
discovered thiseffect, they thought they hadkilled
theanimals, because oftheanimals' complete
relaxation and unresponsiveness. There have
been nopublications ofasimilar effect inhumans
(largely because ofeditorial policies, rather than
from alack ofexperimental evidence), butifthere
were, theanesthetized condition would have tobe
characterized asbeing harmful only inthebehav-
ioral sense, since tissues aren't harmed. When
tumors ofthecorpus luteum produce very large
amounts ofprogesterone, anesthesia has never
been arecognized consequence ofsuch massive
production ofprogesterone. Many years of
animal andhuman study indicate thatthehealth of
themother during pregnancy, andoftheoffspring,
directly correspond tothe amount ofprogesterone
present. (Excess estrogen during pregnancy leads
tofetal death, retardation, orsubsequent health
problems including breast cancer.)
Progesterone production increases tremen-
dously during pregnancy, reaching hundreds of
milligrams perdayinlatepregnancy, soitishard
tothink. ofitinterms ofa"hormone," astradi-
tionally defined. Like serum albumin, Ithink
progesterone should bethought ofprimarily asa
physical/chemical pr.Qtective substance. But,
unlike albumin, itsprotective properties justseem
toincrease with concentration, right uptothe
absorptive limits ofthe cells. (The biological
protection, however, atthe upper extreme,
includes sedation and anesthesia, and isn't
compatible with ordinary function, andso,outside
ofthecontext ofpregnancy (inwhich sedation and
anesthesia areappropriate), these can bethought
ofas"side effects." Since they arepartofproges-
terone's intrinsic function, though, the idea of
"side effect" hastobeunderstood as"collateral to
theintended pharmacological effect." Ithink the
idea of"side effect" connotes adoctrine of"one
substance-one effect," something thedrug indus-
try promotes.)
Progesterone's functions include antitoxic or
catatoxic effects, antiswelling and antiinflamma-
tory effects, antiglucocorticoid andantiprostaglan-
dineffects. When italleviates aproblem, that
doesn't mean that theproblem was caused bya
progesterone deficiency. About 30years ago, I
proposed that biological energy, differentiation,
and respiratory function areintegrated insuch a
way that certain things stabilize/increase them, or
destabilize/weaken them. Radiation, anoxia, and
aging cause many coherent and systematic
changes infunction, and some ofthethings that
have been classified ashormones ornutrients
produce similar changes. Estrogen, Isuggested,
was produced totake advantage ofsomething very
basic inthenature oflife, topromote reparative or
regenerative functions. Like radiation, hypoxia,
and avariety ofstressors and nutritional imbal-
ances, estrogen causes cells totake upwater, and
toshift away from respiratory metabolism, going
intothemitotic state.
Besides being anantiestrogen, progesterone is
aneurosteroid, anantiexcitotoxin, aninhibitory
modulator. But these effects inthe nervous
system have their parallels intheimmune system,
where itmodulates the actions ofmany cells,
protecting the thymus, restraining mast cell
degranulation, inhibiting theshock reaction. Itis
an antitoxin, stabilizing cell structure and
function. Inthe mitochondria, itpreserves or
restores respiratory efficiency. In.the circulatory
system, itregulates heart action andvascular tone,
preventing venous pooling ofthe blood and
orthostatic hypotension, helping tokeep thepulse4
pressure inthe low range indicating efficient
circulation.
Therapeutically, wecanthink interms ofwhat
the organism isdoing inresponse toits
challenges, andsupport those processes ofrestora-
tion, adaptation, inhibition, andreconstruction.
Because excitation orstress isasimple
thing--it isany disturbance oftheliving state's
quiescence--radiation damage, asphyxia, nutri-
tional deficiencies, various poisons, carcinogens,
and irritants can imitate theactions ofestrogen.
Or,looking atestrogen's meaning inevolution,
wecould say that estrogen imitates thenatural
menaces that lifeconfronts, sothat theprocesses
ofregeneration can bemanaged and integrated
into thelifeplans oftheorganisms.
This means that antiestrogenic strategies are
appropriate under agreat variety ofconditions.
Whatever the challenge, asuccessful response
will restore theorganism toanew, high energy
state ofreadiness.
Estrogen's excitatory function, acting briefly,
isanintegral part oftheorganism's preparation
forreproduction, and itisinvolved, inananalo-
gous way, intheresponse toinjury, where its
local release stimulates cell division. Ifstimula-
tion hassuch generalized properties that noxious
events and anatural hormone produce similar
reactions, what kind ofrole does stimulation play
elsewhere intheorganism?
The interaction ofenergy and structure inthe
cell means that anenergy deficit becomes excita-
tory. Inthe case ofnutrition, this has been
worked outinrelatively great detail. Hypoglyce-
mia, forexample, causes agraded, progressive
excitation, that first makes food appetizing, and
then, iftheexcitation iscontinued andintensified,
there isamore generalized arousal, andtheimage
ofthedesired food becomes more generalized.
Need and arousal mobilize various functional
systems tosatisfy theneed. Pavlov, working on
these issues, knew that itwas essential toanswer
thequestion, "what stimulates theactivities that
weconsider uniquely human?" The exploratory
reflex isactivated bynovelty, byanything which
isn't understood. The need/desire forfreedom
and understanding hasthesame basic pattern as
theother needs, andithasapparently evolved by
differentiation from thebasic sensitivity ofthe
living material.
The relatively mild stimulation ofnovelty,
when combined with meeting basic needs and
preventing irrelevant, stressful stimulation, canbe
therapeutic. Forexample, inadigestive distur-
bance, therapeutic stimulation might beachieved
bysomething asmild asbeef broth, acting by
intrinsic (unconditional) chemical processes, orby
some simple alteration intheway thefood is
prepared, orachange inthemealtime atmosphere.
The therapeutic effect oflaughter, which is
produced bysurprise, canbeseen interms ofa
basic organismic process oforganizing resources,
creatively adapting toproduce anew state of
readiness.
Inoutline, abenign stimulation isonewhich
can bemet with adequate energy, with good
humor, andwith anadequate amount ofprogester-
oneandrelated chemical resources.
Alloftheinformation that hasaccumulated
about estrogen inthelastcentury leads totheview
that itistheorganism's means ofproducing a
momentary and localized imbalance, goading
cells intoactivity.
Animportant factor intheintegration of
this momentary imbalance into thelifeofthe
organism isthemanner inwhich destabilizing
excitation and therestoration ofstability, e.g.,
estrogen and progesterone production, relate to
each other. Estrogen stimulates theformation
ofprogesterone, and progesterone lowers the
concentration ofestrogen. (Liu, etaI.,1997)
Whether we consider pregnancy, orbone
metabolism, orthehealth ofthebrain orthecircu-
latory system, nosituation hasbeen identified in
which the"balance ofestrogen andprogesterone"
canbeimproved bytheuseofestrogen supple-
mentation. Butthere isatremendous amount of
information showing that reproduction and the
health ofbones, brain, andcirculatory system, and
many other functions, canbeimproved byanties-
trogenic approaches. Thepharmaceutical industry
istrying toexploit thisinformation, byreclassify-
ingtheir antiestrogenic drugs as"designer estro-
gens." Butthebody already hasitsproper array of5
antiestrogenic strategies, which canbesupported
inmany safeandeconomical ways.

Total Relevels increased tothesame extent after progester-
one withdrawal whether ornot serum estradiol was
maintained. When serum estrogen was maintained ata
steady state, nuclear Re(oRe) increased within 4h of7
progesterone withdrawal, and estrogen-dependent protein
responses (Rp andoxytocin receptor) were obtained within
8h.Thus, progesterone-induced down-regulation ofoRe
and<estrogen-dependent proteins israpidly reversed upon
removal ofhonnone. The recovery response ofRe, Rp, and
oxytocin receptor toprogesterone withdrawal can be
blocked bycycloheximide treatment at4h,suggesting that
receptor recovery involves protein synthesis. These
results areconsistent with thehypothesis that progester-
one down-regulates theResystem byaselective action
onnRe retention.

terone replacement inovariectomized rats inanoften-used
experimental system fordetennination ofthespecific effects
ofthese honnones. Inthis study, two different delivery
systems andtwodifferent dosage levels ofestrogen, proges-
terone oracombination ofthetwohave been used. Estrogen
andprogesterone inthecirculation have been measured in
response toeach treatment. Itisreported that estrogen
treatment (237.2 +/-49.2 pg/mL) results inphysiologi-
cally significant levels ofcirculating progesterone (11.1
+/-1.3ng/mL). Also, co-administration ofprogesterone
(23.7 +/-2.0ng/mL) with estrogen decreases thelevel of
estrogen over that seen with estrogen alone (96.7 +/-19.2
pg/mL with progesterone vs237.2 +/-49.2 pg/mL without
progesterone). Thus, contrary toexpectations, estrogen
replacement therapy isnotspecific toestrogen andsome
oftheantagonistic effects ofprogesterone aretheresult ofa
decrease incirculating estrogen, andnotaspecific effect on
atarget tissue. Whereas themechanism ofthese effects has
notbeen detennined, obvious artifactitous phenomena have
been excluded asbeing their cause. These results could have
amajor impact ontheinterpretation ofpast and future
experiments ofthiskind.

immediate and, more recently, delayed hypersensitivity
reactions. They have been found inthe meninges and
certain brain areas where they arestrictly perivascular,
inclose apposition toneurons, and they areactivated by
direct nerve stimulation orbyneuropeptides. Intracra-
nialmast cells contain many vasoactive substances which
canincrease thepermeability oftheblood-brain barrier,
proteolytic enzymes which candegrade myelin invitro,
aswell aschemotactic molecules which canattract inflam-
matory molecules invivo. Connective tissue mast cells, with8
which intracranial mast cells share many characteristics,
contain cytokines which cancause inflammation directly.
