 Editor: You mentioned in the July Letter that iodine injections have been used in atherosclerosis. An old PDR described the use of iodide in atherosclerosis. Could you tell me who has studied the iodine injections? I liked your comments on Chelation. Ray Peat PO.

The Cancer Hoax
 Editor: Despite the heroic efforts of Terry Fox and Steve Fonyo, cancer is still with us, and cancer will continue to be with us for a long, long time. In fact, cancer will continue to be with us as long as there are enough Terry Fox's and Steve Fonyo's and enough gullible politicians to provide enough public funding to keep the Canadian Cancer Society and the Canadian Cancer Institute plump and fat. The real problem with CANCER is not the cancer itself, because the scientific answers to cancer are known, and the answers to Cancer have been known, for over ten years. The real problem with cancer is the Canadian Cancer Society, which, feeding on the public purse like a giant tumor, has grown into a multimillion dollar business that can survive only by NOT finding the answers that are already here a multimillion dollar Hoax â€” a Hoax that can be perpetuated only by pretending that the answers to cancer have not been found, and are always very close, and "just around the corner" - a gross, merciless multimillion dollar Hoax that continues to deprive the afflicted of their right to know that the answers have been found; a hoax that continues to deprive the hapless victims of cancer of their right to hope, their right to life, and their right to regain whole healthy bodies. The tragic run of Terry Fox was both heroic, and tragic. Heroic because he had such little opportunity for success; and tragic because the Canadian Cancer Society did not tell Terry that all that he really needed to be alive today was lots of Vitamin C, and a little Hydrazine Sulphate from the Syracuse Cancer Research Institute. The long, long run of Steve Fonyo was even more heroic, and is perhaps even more tragic. Heroic because Steve was not even given the benefit of good nutrition for so many more long gruelling miles, and perhaps even more tragic because the Canadian Cancer Society still has not told Steve that the Cancer infective is Progenitor Cryptocides (Genus Actinomycetales); that it can be seen in the blood under a dark-field microscope, and that it just does not go away by itself. The Canadian Cancer Society has not told Steve that as long as Progenitor can be seen active in the blood, the cancer may return, -somewhere- at any time. The Canadian Cancer Society has not told Steve that he could reduce Progenitor and reduce the threat of cancer with autogenous .vaccine from the Virginia Livingston Cancer Research Institute. The Canadian Cancer Society cannot tell Steve these things, even to save his life, or his other leg. Steve must not know! And the Canadian Cancer Society also cannot tell Steve that the chemistry of Laetrile is scientifically correct, and that in other countries Laetrile is being successfully used to reduce cancerous growths, and the Canadian Cancer Society cannot and must not explain to Steve that absissic acid will also reduce cancer, and that cancerous growths can also be dissolved with injections of Wobe-Mugos enzymes! more...
