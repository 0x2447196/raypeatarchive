terminological politeness remindmeof
WoodyAllen'sremarkaboutdeath­

Allofthesecurrentpaperback books
aboutmenopause subscribe tothesame
doctrine aboutreproductive aging.
Uniformity ofopinion creates an
environment inwhichpublishers who
wanttosellalotofbooksfeelthatthey
havetopublishthingsthatdon'tdisturb
thereading public. Booksabout
menopause become booksaboutan
attitudetowardmenopause,
Evenpeoplewholiketosaythatthe
ovaries "don'tfail"atmenopause
describe atheoryinwhichmenopause
anditsconsequences aretheresultof
thedisappearance ofeggsfromthe
ovary.Thattheoryissosimpleitcanbe
described inthreeshortsentences, none
ofwhichistrue:(1)ovaryrunsoutof
eggs;(2)ovulation produces hormones,
80youcantellwhenovulation stops
because theovaries stopproducing
hormones; (3)menstruation stops
becauseovulation hasstopped. Those
principles aresWTOunded byvarious
corollaries. "Estrogen isthefemale
hormone." "Estrogen deficiency
accelerates aging.""'ITeatment with
estrogen makesyoumorefeminine."
"Progesterone deficiency istheresultof
anovulatory cycles."
Many experimenters have
demonstrated thatoldanimals that
havebecomeinfertile keepproducing
eggs.Severalexperimenters (e.g.,R.R.
Maurer andR.H.Foote,l 1971,
"Maternal ageingandembryonic
mortality intherabbit,·J.Reprod.Fert.
25,329-341) haveremoved eggsfrom
theovaries ofoldanimals, andtransplanted thefertilized eggsinto
younganimals, wheretheembryos were
abletoimplantanddevelopnormally.
Ifoundthatoldanimals hadtoo
littleoxygenintheiruterustokeepthe
embryo aliveatthetimeitwould
normally bereadytoimplant itselfin
theuterus.Givingestrogen toayoung
animalcausesasimilarlackofoxygen
intheuterus,andprevents implantation
oftheembryo.
Atthetimeoldanimals would
normally havebecomeinfertile, they
remain fertileiftheyaregivena
supplement ofvitamin Eand
progesterone.
Itisnowestablished thataging
animals, atthetimetheybecome
infertile, aredeficientinprogesterone,
butstiUproduceesbogen..Eveninyoung
individuals, whenstressoccursaround
tbetimeofovulation, interference with
progesterone production willpn!vent
implantation. Ifprogesterone becomes
deficient aftertheembryohasbecome
implanted, miscarriage cx:aus.
Estrogen, actingaloneorwith
insufficient progesterone, causesapams
inthespiralarteriesthatprovideaxygm
andnutrients totheendometrium. This
seemstobethebasisformenstruation,
andisalsobelieved tobeafactorin
miscarriage.
About30yearsago.researchers

AugustWeismann, workingatthe
endoftbelastcenturyandthebeginning
ofthe20thcentury, createdthebasic
ideologyofgenetics, tocombattheidea
oftheinheritance ofacquired
characteristics, whichhadbeen
supported byDarwinandothers.He
arguedthatthehereditary substance,
orgermplasm,wasderivedonlyfrom
preexisting germplasm,andcouldn't
beformedanew,ormodified bythe
environment. Itcreatedeverypartof
theperishable body,byaprocessin

Ihavebeenreferring tothe
·pituitary gonadotropins,- and
deliberately avoidedreferring tothem
asLH-luteinizing hormone -andFSH
-folliclestimulating honnone- because
theirnamesreflectatheoryofwhat
theydo.1nsometextbook descriptions
oftesticular function, forexample, it
hasbeensaidthatLHproduces
testosterone, andthatnegativefeedbackfromtestosterone suppresses LH,while
FSHgovernstlleformation ofsperms.
Thatdescription iscompletely
worthless, andprobably waslargely
builtupbyanalogy withtheir
supposedly neatlydividedfunctions in
theovary,reflected intheirnames.
Thesegonadotropins participate inthe
development, maintenance, and
functioning oftheovaries, andtheir
effectsdependontheirtiming,their
balancewitheachotherandwiththe
steroids produced bytheovariesin
response totheirstimulation, andtheir
actionsaremodified bymanyother
factors, ovarian, nervous, pituitary,
uterine, andimmunological. During
youth,thesystem functions ina
coordinated way,withovulation asa
consequence. Duringaging,thecrucial
changesappeartobeadecreased ability
oftheovaryandthebraintoproduce

Twothingscancausethepituitary
