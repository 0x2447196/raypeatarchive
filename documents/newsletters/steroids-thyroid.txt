Thistype ofmolecule might bethemost common
carbon compound intheuniverse. Itismade by
single celled organisms, byplants, and byanimals, andhas
many kinds offunction. The steroid hormones areinvolved
inallaspects ofanimal physiology, and overlap with con-
trolfunctions ofthenervous system., peptide hormones,
metabolites, prostaglandins, cyclic nucleotides, etc.Some-
times people speak of"steroids" when they mean glucocor-
ticoids such ascortisol orasynthetic like dexamethasone,
or,among athletes, when they mean anabolic steroids or
synthetic androgens; andsoitiscommon toassociate
"steroids" with harmful side effects. Allfoods contain
steroids andsterols (amajor type, containing analcohol
group and aside-chain) some ofwhich arebeneficial and
some ofwhich aretoxic orallergenic.
Inanimals, cholesterol isthebasic sterol molecule,
which ismassively converted into other substances, includ-
ingthesteroid hormones. Thyroid hormone andvitamin A
arerequired forthisconversion. The first step occurs in
theenergy-producing mitochondrion, where cholesterol
loses itsside-chain and isslightly oxidized, producing preg-
nenolone. Being less fatsoluble than cholesterol, preg-
nenolone leaves themitochondrion, soitcan't inhibit its
own synthesis. Rather, itseems tostimulate itsown syn-
thesis, though this isn't asclearly established asinthecase
ofprogesterone.
Depending onthetissue, pregnenolone willbecon-
verted byenzymes inthecytoplasm into either
progesterone orDHEA (Also called DHA,
dehydroepiandrosterone). The fact that progesterone (and
probably pregnenolone) stimulates itsown synthesis means
that taking itdoes notsuppress thebody's ability tosyn-
thesize it,ashappens with cortisol Sometimes, onedose or
afewdoses canrestore thebody's ability toproduce
enough ofitsown.
Progesterone also allows thethyroid gland tosecrete its
hormones, especially when thethyroid function hasbeen
inhibited byestrogen. Since thethyroid hormone isneeded

toproduce progesterone, asupplement ofeither tends to
normalize both thyroid andprogesterone production.
Progesterone andDHEA aretheprecursors forthe
other more specialized steroid hormones, including cor-
tisol, aldosterone (sodium-retaining hormone), estrogen,
andtestosterone. The formation ofthese other hormones .
istightly regulated, sothat taking theprecursor will correctV
adeficiency ofaspecialized hormone, butwillnotcreate
anexcess. Atleast inthecase ofprogesterone, anexcess .
tends tobalance orneutra1izp: anexcess ofthe
hormone, soithasbeen descnbed ashaving anti-
androgenic, anti-estrogen, ant-aldosterone, and anti-cor-
tisol functions.

tabolic efficiency, sparing oxygen andglucose, will have a
quick effect inreducing edema.
During pregnancy, very large amounts ofprogesterone
aremade. Itprotects andstabilizes practically allfunctions
ofboth themother and thefetus. Progesterone, glucose
andthethyroid hormones powerfully influence thebrain
development and intelligence ofthebaby, probably byin-
fluencing both thenumber andthesize ofbrain cells, and
thequality oftheir functioning.
Part ofprogesterone's protective effect isaresult ofits
quieting effect oncells. Forexample, ittends toprevent
seizure activity inbrain cells. During childbirth, itsnormal
function istoactasananesthetic. When thelevel of
estrogen istoohigh, progesterone can't achieve this effect.

until symptoms have been controlled. Otherwise, serious
"drunkenness" canbeproduced, with loss ofcoordination,
and even unconsciousness.
The only solvent forprogesterone which isn't toxic and

Thyroid
ByRaymond Peat, Ph.D.
Measuring theamount ofthyroid intheblood isn't
agood way toevaluate adequacy ofthyroid func-
tion, since theresponse oftissues tothehormone canbe
suppressed (for example, byunsaturated fats).
Inthe1930's accurate diagnosis was made byevaluating
avariety ofindications, including basal oxygen consump-
tion, serum cholesterol level, pulse rate, temperature,
carotenemia, bowel function, and quality ofhair and skin.
Agood estimate canbemade using only thetemperature
and pulse rate.
Oral orarmpit temperature, inthemorning before get-
ting outofbed, should bearound 98"F,and itshould rise
to98.6° bymid-morning. This isnotvalid ofyousleep
under anelectric blanket, oriftheweather ishotand
humid. Aperson who ishypothyroid produces heat atalow
rate, butdoesn't lose itatthenormal rate, since there is
less sweating, and theskin isrelatively cooL Many
hypothyroid people compensate with high adrenalin
production (sometimes 40times higher than normal), and
thistends tokeep theskin cool, especially onthehands,
feet, and nose. The high adrenalin istheconsequence of
lowblood glucose, soafeeding ofcarbohydrate, such asa
glass oforange juice, willsometimes lower thepulse rate
momentarily. Healthy populations have anaverage resting
pulse rate ofabout 85perminute. Especially inhot
weather itisuseful toconsider both temperature and pulse
rate.
2times use50to100mg.perday. Inthecustomary 10% solu-
tion, onedrop contains about 3mg.progesterone, and 1
ml.(1J4 tsp.) contains 100mg.The first dose should never
bemgre than 15mg.(An ounce of10% progesterone in
vitamin Eis$15; adozen one-ounce bottles is$144.)
Pregnenolone, taken orally, does nothing noticeable toa
healthy animal orperson, butifthestress-related hor-
mones areelevated, they return tonormal when preg-
nenolone istaken. The brain contains much more preg-
nenolone, DHEA, and progesterone than doother organs
ortheblood, and these levels decrease progressively with
age. Older people aremore likely tofeel aneffect from
pregnenolone, than areyoung people. (Atengram bottle
ofpregnenolone is$20; 1J4kg.is$250. Atenth ofagram is
areasonable first dose, though some people seem toneed
asmuch as1gram perday.)
The Achilles tendon reflex isanother quick way toes-
timate thyroid function. This reflex isused because ofthein-
significant weight ofthetoes inrelation tocontraction ofthe
gastrocnemius muscle. The T(repolarization) wave onthe
electrocardiogram isasimilar indicator oftherate ofenergy
production. Thumping theAchilles tendon causes the
muscle tocontract (unless itisalready inasemi-contracted
state, which isn't uncommon). The contraction consumes
energy, and themuscle can't relax until enough energy has
been produced torestore thethreshold and thereadiness
foranew contrac-
tion.
Ifenergy produc- ::
tion isefficient, -
relaxation isfaster-=-
than thepassive _
return motion ofthe,..
foot, sothefoot -'--
swings freely back to C'
itsoriginal position, <:
and over shoots
slightly, causing at-
slight swinging action. Inhypothyroidism, thefoot returns as
ifcontrolled byapneumatic door-closer, and settles slowly
and precisely into itsrelaxed position, sometimes with a
hesitating, intermittent motion. This slow replenishment of
energy, andslow relaxation, cancause muscles tocramp
easily. The aching legmuscles ofchildren attheend ofanac-
tivedayareoften asign ofhypothyroidism, and sometimes
thegastrocnemius muscle becomes very swollen and hyper-
trophied inhypothyroid children. The same process, ofslow
energy regeneration, cancause rhythm disturbance inthe
heart, and often causes insomnia and restless sleep.
The thyroid gland secretes about 3parts ofthyroxin to
one part oftriiodothyronine, and thisallows theliver to
regulate thyroid function, byconverting more oftheT4to
theactive 1'3when there isanabundance ofenergy.
Glucose isessential fortheconversion, soduring fasting
there isasharp decrease inmetabolic rate, andinexperi-
ments, 200or300calories ofcarbohydrates canbeadded
tothedietwithout causing fatstorage.
When theliver isthemain cause ofhypothyroidism,
your temperature (and especially thetemperature ofyour
nose, hands and feet) will fallwhen youarehungry, and
will risewhen youeatcarbohydrates. Ifahypothyroid per-
sonhasavery slow pulse, and feels lethargic, itseems that
there islittle adrenalin; inthiscase, afeeding ofcar-
bohydrate islikely toincrease both thepulse rate andthe
temperature, astheliver ispermitted toform theactive 1'3
hormone.
Women often have above-average thyroxin, with
symptoms ofhypothyroidism. This isapparently because it
isn't being converted totheactive form (1'3). Before using
aCytome1 (1'3) supplement, itmight bepossible tosolve
theproblem with diet alone. Apiece offruit oraglass of
juice ormilk between meals, and adequate animal protein
(orpotato protein) inthediet issometimes enough to
allow theliver toproduce thehormone. IfCytomel isused,
itisefficient toapproximate thephysiological rate of1'3
formation, bynibbling one(10or25mcg.) tablet during
theday. When alarge amount istaken atonetime, the
liver islikely toconvert much ofittotheinactive reverse-
1'3form, inanormal defensive response.
Women normally have lessactive livers than men do.
Estrogen canhave adirectly toxic effect ontheliver, but
thenormal reason forthedifference isprobably that
temperature and thyroid function strongly influence the
liver, andaregenerally lower inwomen than inmen.
Estrogen inhIbits thesecretion ofhormone bythethyroid
gland itself, probably byinhibiting theproteolytic enzyme
which dissolves thecolloid. Progesterone hastheopposite
effect, promoting therelease ofthehormones from the
gland. Atpuberty, inpregnancy, and atmenopause, the
thyroid gland often enlarges, probably asaresult of
estrogen dominance.
Thyroid function stimulates theliver toinactivate
estrogen forsecretion, soestrogen dominance cancreate a
vicious circle, inwhich excess estrogen (ordeficient
progesterone) blocks thyroid secretion, causing theliver to
allow estrogen toaccumulate toeven higher levels.
Progesterone (even onedose, insome causes) canbreak
thecycle. However, ifthegland isvery big, theperson can
experience afewmonths ofhyperthyroidism, asthegland
returns tonormal. Itisbetter toallow theenlarged gland
toshrink more slowly byusing athyroid supplement. Ifan
enlarged gland does begin tosecrete toomuch thyroid hor-
mone, itcanbecontrolled with tablets ofpropylthiouracil,
oreven with raw cabbage orcabbage juice, andcysteine-
rich meats, including liver.Besides fasting, orchronic protein deficiency, thecom-
mon causes ofhypothyroidism areexcessive stress or
"aerobic" (i.e., anaerobic) exercise, anddiets containing
beans;lentils, nuts, unsaturated fats(including carotene),
andunder cooked broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, ormus-
tard greens. Many health conscious people become
hypothyroid with asynergistic program ofunder cooked
vegetables, legumes instead ofanimal proteins, oilsin-
stead ofbutter, carotene instead ofvitamin A,andbreath-
lessexercise instead ofastimulating life.

,0': duetotheir eltects onmetabolic parame-
ters. Asshown byprescription for contraceptive use,
replacement therapy with oral synthetic oestrogens
induces adiabetogenic tendency aswell ashypertensive,
dyslipidaemic and thrombogenic risks, especially when
associated with progestins issued from nortestosterone.
Reducing theoestrogen doses, using equine sulfoconjugates
and selecting non-androgenic progestins has already
minimized these deleterious effects. The present availability
oforal orpercutaneous natural 17beta oestradiol andof
norpregnanes calls forreconsideration oftheglucidic risk
due tooestroprogestin prescription. Afew studies have
already shown that infact they canimprove glucose toler-
ance. The recommended substitution ofmenopause to
prevent atherosclerosis must lead toabetter characterization
ofitsglycaemic andinsulinaemic effects.

163: IPt2,382-7. "Inacross-sectional study that aimed to
identitY riskfactors fordiabetes, 1290 consecutive, healthy,
nonpregnant women ofchild-bearing agewere examined ina
center forpreventive medicine. Anin-depth interview about
menses, useoforal contraceptives, and menopause was
performed. Plasma glucose atfasting and2hours after a75
gm glucose load, glycated hemoglobin AIc,fasting plasma
insulin, total plasma cholesterol, and triglycerides were
measured. Compared with nonusers taking noprogestogens,
oral contraceptive users (n=431; 33.4%) were younger (p
lessthan 0.001) andleaner (plessthan 0.001). After adjust-
ment forageandbody mass index, oral contraceptive users
hadhigher 2-hour plasma glucose (p less than 0.001), higher
fasting plasma insulin (plessthan 0.0I).and higher triglyc-
erides levels (pless than 0.01). Fasting plasma glucose,
glycated hemoglobin AIc,and total cholesterol did not
significantly differ between thetwo groups. [nrelation to
dosage and types ofsteroid components, few differences
have been found between high-dose and low-dose oral
contraceptives oraccording tothe estrogen-progestogen
balance ofthe preparations. Use oforal contraceptives
appears toinduce an increase ofinsulin-resistance
markers, which have recently been cited asrisk factors
forischemic vascular diseases. These markers should be
carefully monitored inoralcontraceptive users.
"Effect ofestrogen onhyperprolactinemia-induced
glucose intolerance inSHN mice," Matsuda M;Mori T,
Proc Soc Er:p Bioi Med. 1996 Jul,212:3, 243-7. "The effects
ofprolactin (PRL) oncirculating levels ofglucose and
insulin, and ofestradiol onhyperprolactinemia-indu ced
glucose intolerance oftissues were studied inpituitary-
grafted SHN mice (PG mice) and sham-operated controls.
Pituitary grafting (PG) decreased blood glucose levels in
male mice atIand3months after theoperation butdidnot
alter those infemales. PGhad little effect onserum insulin
levels inmales, butincreased those infemales. [nfemalemice at2months after PG,blood glucose levels were signili-
cantly higher atI,2,and 4hrafter glucose load when
compared with those incontrols. Incontrast. there was no
signific31nt difference inblood glucose levels after glucose
load between male PGandcontrol mice. The rate atwhich
blood glucose levels decreased was slower infemale PG
mice than incontrols during the 30min after insulin
injection. whereas there was nodifference intherate after
insulin injection between male PGand control mice. In
ovariectomized (Ovx) mice. nosignificant difference was
found intheblood glucose levels after aglucose load
between PGandcontrol groups at2months after PG. In
Ovx mice treated daily with estrogen. however, a
PG-dependent high level ofblood glucose was observed
after glucose load. These results suggest that hyperprolac-
tinemia decreases glucose tolerance viaanincrease in
insulin resistance infemale SHN mice and that estrogen
isessential totheexpression orthe PRL effect."

SAFFLOWER OIL AS THE CONTROL DlET:
"Dietary fishoildelays puberty infemale rats," Zhang Z;
Benson B;Logan JL, Bioi Reprod, 1992 Dec, 47:6,
998-1003. "Marine oils contain eicosapentaenoic acid, a
fatty acid thatc()mpetes forcyclooxygenase andreduces the
synthesis ofdienoic prostanoids including prostaglandin E2
(PGE2). Since PGE2 plays animportant role inthe
estrogen-stimulated release ofhypothalamic GnRH on
proestrus, itwas postulated that adiet containing fish oil
would delay first ovulation through inhibitory effects on
GnRH release. Thirty, 22-day-old female Sprague-Dawley

"...Since ahigh-fat diet may increase circulating estro-
gen levels and possibly breast cancer risk, dietary factors
during pregnancy could influence theriskofdeveloping this
disease." "Pregnant orvirgin female Sprague-Dawley rats
that had been previously treated with 10 mg 7,
12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) byorat gavage when
55days oldwere assigned toone oftwo isocaloric diets
containing either 16% calories from fat(low-fat) or43%
calories from fat(high-fat) forthelength ofpregnancy orfor
theequivalent time ofapproximately 21days. There were 20
pregnant and 10nonpregnant DMBA-treated ratspergroup.
Ten additional pregnant animals (not previously treated with
DMBA) pergroup were used forhormone analysis. The fat
source used was com oil.which ishigh inn-6 polyun-
saturated fatty acids, primarily linoleic acid. The animals
were checked for tumors atleast once per week by
palpation. The tumor size, number, and latency toappear-
ance after carcinogen exposure were recorded. The statistical
significance ofobserved differences was tested byuseof
appropriate two-sided tests. RESULTS: Female rats on
different diets hadvirtually identical food intakes andweight
gains during pregnancy. On gestation day 19, serumestradiol levels were approximately twofold higher in'J_
rats fedahigh-fat diet than inrats fedalow-fat diet (P<
.02). The serum insulin levels and insulin/glucose ratios (an
index ofinsulin resistance) inrats fedthehigh-fat diet were
approximately twofold lower than inrats fedthe
diet, butthedifferences didnotreach statistical significance
(P<.09and P<.09, respectively). Onweek 18following
DMBA administration, the number ofrats developing
mammary tumors was significantly higher inthe group
exposed toahigh-fat diet(40% ofanimals) than inthegroup
exposed toalow-fat diet(10% ofanimals) during pregnancy
(P<.05). Tumor multiplicity, latenCy totumor appearance,
and sizeoftumors upon first detection were similar among
the dietary groups. Np intergroup differences inthe
mammary tumor incidence were noted invirgin animals that
were exposed tothehigh- orlow-fat diets foranequivalent
period oftime. CONCLUSrONS: Our findings indicate
(hat consumption ofadiet high illfat(primarily inthe
form of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids) during
pregnancy increases the risk ofdeveloping carcinogen-
induced mammary tumors, possibly byincreasing the
pregnancy levels ofcirculating estrogens. IMPLICA-
TIONS: Iffurther studies find that theresults from animal
model studies areapplicable tohumans, some human breast
cancers may bepreventable bydietary manipulations during
pregnancy. "
