Estrogen, Aging, Radiation,
Migraine &Energy
The Manhattan Project demonstrated that, by
spending acouple ofbillion dollars, avery
impressive explosion could becreated byexploit-
ingtheunsurprising factthat, inthepresence ofa
sufficie:lt mass ofsuitable material, spontaneous
radioactivity becomes self-stimulating. Part ofthe
taxpayers' money was spent onconvincing the
public thatthebomb was anatural outcome ofthe
fundamentally humanistic scientific enterprise
which would give everyone free electricity anda
generally glorious life.
Now that wehave genetically modified foods,
and gamma-irradiated meats and vegetables,
maybe it'stime toevaluate theprocess that has
ledustothese technologies. Byseeing how we
arrived atour present scientific-technological
state, Ithink many seemingly unrelated scientific
andmedical issues will take onnew meaning, and
Ithink this historical context will justify some
reorientations intherapy.
Albert Einstein's name isoften associated
with theManhattan Project, butyears earlier he
departed from the statistical world-view, the
assumption ofmetaphysical randomness, that has
characterized "quantum physics," aswell as
nuclear physics. During the years inwhich
metaphysical randomness took over official
physics, thatworld-view was also being applied to
genetics. Eugenics and Racial Hygiene reached
their peak almost simultaneously with therealiza-
tion oftheAtomic Bomb (orTomic Bomb, asF.
Soddy more correctly called it). Precisely the
same mathematical formulas were used to
describe nuclear fission andgenetic mutation.
Young physicists from theManhattan Project,
with government financing, smoothly made a
transition into genetics, becoming, almostS! .' .. • H '\' .';".'

mysteriously, leaders inthefield of"molecular
biology." Government subsidies forthenuclear
power industry were becoming government subsi-
diesfortheindustrialization ofbiology.
Theprestige oftheir background asManhattan
Project physicists made itunnecessary forthem to
learn anything about biology. Astheir institutes
ofmolecular biology took over biology depart-
ments inthe1960s, they were able tocontrol what
was being taught toboth undergraduate and
graduate biology students.
The physics andphysical chemistry that were
really relevant tobiology, thathadbeen developed
before thegovernment/industry consortium took
over, were effectively suppressed. Ifoldscience
journals and monographs didn't just disappear,
they were putinto "storage," where they couldn't
bebrowsed. AtUCLA, forexample, youhave to
place anorder foraspecific journal, andthen wait
days forsomeone tosearch forthebook. Comput-
erized data-bases simply ignored theolder work,
even though thevolume ofresearch published
throughout theworld in1930 or1950 would be
similar totheamount currently published ina
week ormonth.
The head ofOregon's Institute ofMolecular
Biology argued that science develops byitsown
logic, andcan't beblamed fortheanti-humanistic
ways inwhich itisused. Since, asaManhattan
Project physicist, hedidn't have anyknowledge of
biology orofother branches ofphysical science,
hecouldn't beaware ofthepowerful ways in
which science was distorted byindustrial and
military intervention. Science, asanideal, of
course can't beblamed forthe anti-scientific
absurdities thathave been sold tothepublic itLthe
name ofscience.
First, aphilosophy ofatomistic reductionism
toldpeople thatthey must give upideas ofteleol-
ogy, anthropomorphism, purpose, direction,
consciousness, and holism, asarchaic metaphysi-
caland unscientific concepts. Then, inthis
cultural vacuum, itwas possible toimpose the
metaphysic ofcontrol and oftechnological
improvement, anaccountant's metaphysics ofthe
bottom line, which always looks forthequickest
return andthemost discrete result. The doctrine
ofgenetic determinism was intrinsic tothe2
Eugenics movement: The proper authorities
could improve therace bykilling the inferior
specimens, because itisinthe(random) nature of
theworld that things would degenerate ifthefit
weren't preserved and theunfit destroyed. The
mathematical treatment ofrandom events hasno
place forthecomplexities ofcontext, and sois
perfect forasystem inwhich theonly issue isthe
power tocontrol for animmediate benefit.
Ecology and physiology were marginalized by
their very complexity.
These doctrines ofrandom mutation, and
of"hygienically" killing thedeviant cells, took
over cancer biology, with governmental
financing.
There wasnoshortage ofevidence thatcontra-
The definition ofagene has been revised
many times. Originally, agene was something
that produced "atrait," and then itwas said to
bethe"functional unit ofheredity." Currently, it
isoften stated as"the section ofDNA that
contains theinformation formaking afunctonal
biological product, which may beaprotein oran
RNA molecule." But, informally, thetraditional
view isoften passed on,leading many people to
think that each protein has"itsgene."
The dogmatic view (once taught bymolecu-
lar geneticists) that "one gene produces one
protein" has falsified everything inbiology: In
reality, the environmentally responsive changes
inthecomposition ofproteins means that there
areamultitude ofdifferent "growth hormones,"
"prolactins," "interleukins," "hormone recep-
tors," etc. Stress and aging cause cumulative
deviations through this process ofchemical
differentiation.
dicted the idea that cancer arises asasingle
mutant cell, butfewpeople arenow aware ofthat
evidence. Harry Rubin isoneofthefew people
remaining who understand theevidence, andbuild
onit.
Rather than seeing cancer (oraging orvarious
degenerative diseases) asaspecial problem in
developmental biology, governed bycomplex
interactions ofcells with their environment, the
doctrine ofthedeviant mutant cellhasbecome
anexcuse forgross biological ignorance.
Chronic irritation used tobeemphasized asa
cause ofcancer, butalloftheirritating fact.ors
were reduced tomutagenic factors, andthismade
itpossible todevalue thetissue changes produced
bychronic injury, which preceded and accompa-
nied thedevelopment ofcancer.
Tissue fibrosis, which was associated with
both inflammation and atrophy ofinjured tissues,
became separated from the study ofcancer,
because itwas acomplex physiological process,
andnotadistinct genetic event.
But changes intheconnective tissue matrix
were always crucially involved intheprocess of
cancerization, and these changes overlapped with
thechanges that could beseen inmany other
biological processes.
Ionizing radiation produces inflammation,
edema, over-production ofcollagen, and finally
atrophy and fibrosis, with hardening ofthe
collagen and slowing ofrepair processes. Inthe
atrophic tissue, cancer sometimes develops. Many
other harmful agents produce very similar
sequences oftissue changes--heat, suffocation,
malnutrition, chemical poisoning, and estrogen
excess, forexample.
The roleofthebalanced, orimbalanced, tissue
environment incarcinogenesis can beseen very
clearly inanexperiment inwhich small sheets of
plastic were implanted inanimals. Near some of
thesheets, 'nests ofcancer cells would develop,
butthey always developed inaconcavity that had
been formed bythefolding oftheplastic sheet,
almost isolating some cells from their normal
environment. This experiment was reminiscent of
the experiments ofHans Selye's, inwhich he
found that thetissue which had grown into small
subcutaneously implanted glass tubes aged much
more rapidly than therestoftheanimal's tissues.
The changes ofaging aresosimilar tothose of
radiation damage that some people have believed
thataging was caused byenvironmental radiation,
oratleast that radiation accelerates normal aging.
The first isn't true, the second isprobably
approximately true. Anything that produces
inflammation, increasing collagen production and
collagen hardening, andthat slows tissue renewal,
isaccelerating changes that seem characteristic of
aging. But theidea that radiation produces agingbycreating mutations has been very clearly
refuted. Molecular biologists generally lostinter-
estintheage-accelerating effects ofraditation
when they saw itwasn't acting through genetic
mutations.
Ultraviolet damage totheskin causes changes
intheextracellular connective substance that are
very similar toaging, butthatcanbedistinguished
from thenormal agechanges byslight differences
inthechemistry ofthe cross-links that make the
tissue more rigid. Forpractical purposes, though,
the similarities are more important than the
differences.
The "collagen theory ofaging" was theidea
that thechanges which occur intheextracellular
matrix (ofwhich collagen isonly onecomponent)
lead to progressive changes in cellular
metabolism, shutting offtheir access totheblood
stream, and that these changes inthematrix are
theessential cause ofaging. The differences in
thickness andflexibility between tanned cowhide
and calf-skin, thetoughness ofmeat from old
animals, andtherigidity ofligaments inoldjoints
make itobvious thatconnective tissue changes are
characteristic ofaging.
Some people who advocate the collagen
theory ofaging believe that thecross-links that
accumulate with agearemainly produced byfree
radicals (which may bederived from peroxidized
lipids, heavy metals, radiation, orascorbic acid,
forexample), butothers emphasize therole of
glucose informing thelinks, since diabetes accel-
erates thehardening ofcollagen.
Inscar tissue, calluses, keloids, andoilgranu-
lomas orallergic granulomas, tissue injury or
stress has produced structural changes. Tissue
stress affects thestructure ofconnective tissues
very generally. Tendons and bones areguided
and altered intheir development bypressure and
tension. Histologists have said that they can
distinguish structural differences inthebones of
wild animals and tame animals ofthe same
species, apparently resulting from thedifferences
intheir way oflife.
Cellular and extracellular responses areinter-
active, sothat stressed cells produce defective
extracellular matrix, which cancontribute tothe
stress ofthecells. Changes induced bystress in
some cases interfere with theproper differentia-
tion ofcells regulated bytheir extracellular
matrix.
Inearly studies ofestrogen-treated animals,
estrogen was found tocause tremendous increases
inthe deposition ofcollagen. In the 1960s,
detailed studies onthehardening oftendons with
aging were done. Itwas discovered that estro-
gen treatment accelerated the stiffening of
tendons that normally occurs with aging, and
thatprogesterone reversed theestrogen effect.
Onthelevel ofthewhole organism, stress
causes overactivity ofthepituitary, and removal
ofthe pituitary extends life, and retards the
hardening of the extracellular connective
material (Everitt, etaI.,1983). The coHagen
theory of aging necessarily involves the
endocrine system.
When Iwas measuring theoxygen consump-
tion ofuterine tissue from animals ofdifferent
ages, Ifound that tissue from some oftheoldest
animals hadwhat appeared tobe"negative oxygen
consumption," that is,some gas was being
produced atahigher rate than oxygen was being
produced, increasing thevolume orpressure ofthe
airinthechamber, instead ofdecreasing it.Since
Iknew that fatigued nerve andmuscle emit some
ammonia, Iarranged myexperiment sothat both
carbon dioxide and ammonia would beabsorbed
from theair, and found that these tissues were
actually consuming oxygen atamuch higher rate
than tissues from young animals. While theuterus
ofayoung animal isflexible andbright pink, the
uterus from atypical old animal was stiff and
purple orblue, indicating anoxygen deficiency.
Apparently, their high rateofoxygen consumption
was creating arelatively hypoxic condition inthe
aged uterus. (The rest ofmy research had todo
with identifying the nature ofthis oxygen
consumption; estrogen stimulates the "NADH-
oxidase" enzyme function, which---like
age-pigment itself---can create ashort-circuit
between oxygen and theNADH energy source.
This serves thepurpose ofallowing glycolysis to
continue intheabsence ofnormal mitochondrial
functioning, and probably interferes with normal
mitochondrial production ofATP, C02, etc., by
competing fortheoxygen supply.)4
Estrogen isknown todecrease liver glycogen
storage, while progesterone increases it. Ifa
tissue isstimulated tometabolize atahigh rate,
especially without anadequate supply ofglucose,
itwill consume protein asfuel, with theproduc-
tion ofammonia. Apparently, what Isaw inmy
experiments with theolduteri was aconsequence
ofcombining ahigh level ofstimulation with a
low level ofglucose andoxygen. Innerves, this
would becalled excitotoxicity.
Although there are several ways inwhich
estrogen canincrease theformation ofammonia,
just producing hypoxia issufficient tocause a
large increase inammonia production. Any
exaggerated stimulation, stress, or energy
deficit tends toincrease thelevel ofammonia in
tissue. Because oftheassociation ofammonia
with energy depletion, many people argue that the
ammonia released from nerve andmuscle comes
primarily from thebreakdown ofATP,leading to
thedearnination ofadenosine. Butby1970 there
was already clear evidence forother important
sources ofammonia. The useofamino acids for
fuel, which happens during stress, releases
ammonia. Eating isolated amino acids, exercis-
ing intensely, orhaving anexcess ofcortisol,
causes tissue proteins tobebroken down, with
the release ofammonia. Although the free
amino acid, glutamate, can becombined with
ammonia toremove itsafely from cells, ammonia
can also becombined with theglutamic acid (or
aspartic acid) groups intissue proteins. This
binding ofammonia toanacid iscalled amida-
tion.
When Ihave written about theimportance of
carbon dioxide, Imentioned thatitbinds toamino
groups (often lysine) inproteins, protecting those
groups from combination with sugars (glycosyla-
tion) orthe products oflipid peroxidation.
Peptide hormones and antibodies function very
differently when they have been glycosylated.
The lysine groups, that are soimportant for
carbon dioxide's protective effects, areimportant
sites forthecross-linking reactions incollagen,
and one form ofcross-linking involves the
connection ofaglutamine group inone protein
with thelysine group inanother.
Amidation and deamidation occur fairly
massively during fatigue and rest inbrain
proteins, and inmany other systems. The
activities of proteins are changed as a
consequence, but there has been very little
research into this important area, because the
dogma that "one gene produces one protein" has
created thesense that there issomething unwhole-
some about these protein-modifying complexities.
Nevertheless, itisclear that inflammation,
connective tissue aging, keratinization, and
antigenic changes oftissues and proteins
(relevant toautoimmunity and "connective
tissue diseases" aswell asnormal development)
areinfluenced byamidation.
Estrogen causes epithelial cells tocornify or
keratinize (condensing, and being converted
mainly into the"horny" material, keratin) earlier
than they would otherwise. This process offmal
differentiation normally occurs asthecells ofthe
skin ormucous membrane grow outward, away
from the blood vessels that supply them with
nutrients andoxygen. Simply growing away from
their supporting blood vessels creates astress of
deprivation. Vitamin Aisoneofthefactors that
opposes estrogen andprevents premature keratini-
zation ofepithelial cells.
The sam<e enzymes that keratinize cells under
theinfluence ofestrogen, and that participate in
thesolidification ofblood clots and thecontrac-
tion ofconnetive tissue inhealing wounds, can
also cross-link collagen molecules.
One ofthemolecules forming thecrosslink
bond isglutamine, which exists normally in
proteins, but which can also beformed bythe
addition ofammonia totheacidic side-chain of
glutamic acid: The other amino acid thatreacts to
form thecross-link bond islysine, which canbe
protected against chemical reactions bycombining
with carbon dioxide, This protective effect of
carbon dioxide isprobably aswidely distributed as
islysine inprotein, though even when alysine
group isn't exposed, allproteins have anamino
group atone end that can interact with carbon
dioxide orother substance. Hormones and their
"receptors," enzymes, and structural proteins
allexist inmultiple forms. The genetic dogma
that "one gene corresponds toone protein" has::>
been extremely misleading, and has allowed
most researchers toignore theprocesses that
dominate physiological adaptation.
Oxygen deprivation isenough tostimulate
collagen synthesis (Chvapil; 1968, 1969, 1975),
and isprobably one ofthecommon factors in
tissue degeneration. Estrogen excess tends to
reduce theavailability ofoxygen intissues, and
oxygen deprivation inmany cases imitates
estrogenic stimulation ..The ammonia produced
instressed tissues contributes tochanges incolla-
gen and the extracellular matrix, and has both
local andsystemic effects.
Ammonia, like estrogen, promotes the
excitotoxic processes, activating theproduction
ofnitric oxide (NO), and stimulating thegluta-
mate receptors, sometimes causing seizures,
and ifprolonged, causing stupor orcoma. But
italways activates thepituitary, and inother
tissues, theproduction offree radicals causes
molecular tissue damage. The stressors
produced byestrogen, for example NO and
growth hormone, activate the enzyme
aromatase, which synthesizes estrogen, injust
one ofthe many vicious circles. Growth
hormone tends toincrease ammonia levels.
Estrogen isjust one oftheintrinsic excita-
tory substances, which areproduced bystress,
and which participate inself-stimulating loops.
Ammonia and nitric oxide aretwo ofthemost
pervasive endogenous excitants andtoxins. ''NO
[nitric oxide] isemerging asan important
endogenously-derived neurotoxin" (Dawson and
Dawson, 1995).
Ammonia, like nitric oxide, ip_lllbits respira-
tion, and can increase theCrabtree effect (with
aerobic glycolysis stimulated by increased
glucose, inhibiting respiration). This suggests an
important role foritincancer ingeneral, and
especially inliver cancer. Intheuncontrolled
glycolysis ofcancer, ammonia can beused to
form amino acids from thelactate and pyruvate
produced byglycolysis, supporting growth ofthe
tumor attheexpense ofthenormal tissues that are
producing ammonia byprotein degradation.
Ammonia can produce both convulsive
seizures and stupor orcoma, and italters brain
cells, shifting the balance toward that seen m
Alzheimer's disease.
Ammonia contributes tothehypertrophy of
damaged kidneys, and the same mechanism,
decreased protein breakdown inthepresence of
too much ammonia, probably contributes tothe
increased volume ofextracellular matrix that
occurs insomany diseases ofstress, aging, and
hyperestrogenism.
Ammonia hasalso been found tobeincreased
during migraine attacks. Isuspect that progester-
one's sometimes dramatic effect onmigraine
involves ammonia and energy metabolism.
Ammonia disturbs carbon dioxide's regulation of
brain circulation, and when ammonia is"detoxi-
fied" into glutamine (though glutamine isstill
toxic inexcess) ATP isconsumed, leading to
dysregulation ofvascular smooth muscle. Proges-
terone's ability tostop the local excitation of
nerve cells spares ATP. Itseems likely that nitric
oxide, the production ofwhich isinhibited by
progesterone, isalso involved inthevasodilation
andenergy depletion.
Almost anysort ofliver disease increases the
systemic ammonia level. Estrogen can cause a
large variety ofliver diseases, including fatty liver
andcholestasis; ammonia, which istoxic initself,
also links into another potentially toxic system,
theporphyrin synthetic system.
Porphyria (acute intermittent porphyria,
hepatic porphyria) isadisease that can cause
nerve damage, hypertension, andconnective tissue
damage. It typically involves anexcess oftwo
precursors ofheme, andsometimes adeficiency of
heme (needed forrespiratory enzymes), and itis
often triggered byhypoglycemia, byexercise, and
byestrogen orbycertain poisons. Although itis
usually described asastrictly genetic disease, itis
higWy susceptible toenvironmental influences,
and aproper reevaluation oftheevidence might
show that itismore often environmental than
genetic. Most oftheevidence foragenetic cause
consists ofmeasurements that show low activity
ofcertain enzymes. Since theconditions prevail-
ingwhen aprotein issynthesized can affect its
structure and functions, thesimple measurement
ofenzyme activity ishardly anappropriate
argument.6
The two substances that accumulate happen to
beinasynthetic sequence, subsequent toastep in
which C02 isremoved, and before astep in
which NH3, ammonia, isremoved. The principle
ofmass action indicates that areaction will slow
orstop when there isacertain concentration ofthe
product ofthereaction. High C02 and low NH3
will prevent anaccumulation ofthese chemicals,
oneofwhich isapotent neurotoxin. The opposite
situation, lowC02 andhigh NH3 (ammonia), will
tend tocause anaccumulation ofthese substances.
Therefore, asimple metabolic shift that predicta-
bly happens instress and malnutrition, can
explain themain type ofporphyria, independently
ofspecific genetic problems. Everyone's genetic
constitution isunique, and inametabolically
complex condition such asporphyria, there will
beaspectrum ofsusceptibility. Todraw aline
across thespectrum, dividing people with "genetic
defects" from thenormal, isapurely arbitary and
illogical procedure. Itismuch more important to
identify and eliminate "porphyriogenic"
environments.
Since porphyria attacks commonly occur
premenstrually orafter skipping ameal, thefood
cravings caused by increased estrogen ·and
lowered blood sugar, areprobably reinforced in
many people bydread oftheterrible symptoms
that canbeproduced bynoteating enough, result-
ingfrom theincreased ammonia and porphyrins
orporphyrin precursors. Calorie restriction canbe
dangerous when porphyria isdeveloping.
The presence ofporphyrin poisoning, with its
associated free radical toxins, can lead tothe
activation ofheme oxygenase, theenzyme which
produces carbon monoxide, which Ihave
discussed elsewhere asacause oftherespiratory
defect that characterizes cancer. Both ammonia
andporphyria have been implicated intheproduc-
tion ofcancer.
Acetazolamide, adrug that causes carbon
dioxide toberetained inthetissues, tends to
block theformation ofammonia. This isprobably
aconfirmation ofthe importance ofcarbon
dioxide asananti-ammonia factor. High altitude
also causes increased retention ofcarbon dioxide
inthetissues, because oftheHaldane-Bohr effect,
andthereduction ofammonia (production, serum
concentration, and excretion) athigh altitude is
probably even greater than thereduction oflactate
production.
Fibrotic tissue canberepaired, and theessen-
tialthing istointerrupt theprocesses thatcaused it
todevelop. Ihave written previously about the
effects ofvitamin E,progesterone, and DHEA on
scars, keloids, scleroderma, arthritis, and liver
cirrhosis, but there are many helpful therapies.
Saturated fats are extremely important inthe
reversal offibrosis. Recently, ithasbeen found
thatjust covering akeloid with alayer ofsilicone
causes ittoregress tosome extent. Ithink the
sealant allows carbon dioxide toaccumulate, shift-
ing the balance away from growth and toward
shrinkage ofthecollagenous mass.
The particular therapy that's most helpful will
depend ontheparticular nature ofthestressor, but
good nutrition isalways of the greatest
importance. Carnitine protects against ammonia;
adenosine, niacin, and caffeine protect against
various types ofexcitotoxicity. Vitamin A
protects against premature cornification, and
probably other cross-linking. Thyroid, progester-
one, and glucose help tominimize exaggerated
protein catabolism, and magnesium has agreat
variety ofrestorative functions.
Carnitine hasbeen used with sodium benzoate
andphenylacetate tolower ammonia, butthelatter
canproduce some side effects. Except fortreat-
ingneurotoxic ammonia, Idon't recommend use
ofcarnitine supplementation, since there isgood
evidence that carnitine increases oxidative damage
when there isanabundance ofunsaturated fatin
theorganism. Aspirin's similarity tobenzoate and
phenyl acetate suggests that itmight sometimes
help toremove ammonia. The safest procedure is
touse foods, such asfruit juices, that regulate
nitrogen metabolism invaried ways.
The alpha-keto acids, which arefound inmany
fruits, can bind ammonia, becoming ordinary
amino acids. Potato juice (eliminating thestarch
with acarrot juicer) isarich source ofthese alpha-
keto acids.
Estrogen increases fairly steadily with aging in
men, and itseffects become more harmful as
testosterone and other protective antiestrogensdecline with aging. Inwomen, theabsolute estro-
gen level rises until near menopause, butduring
those years very high levels ofprogesterone
protect most women against itsharmful effects.
The diseases that affect women more often than
men aremainly diseases caused byafailure of
progesterone and thryoid toregulate estrogen.
The generally greater resistance and longevity of
women can beattributed largely toprogesterone
dominance over estrogen. The extremely high
progesterone production during pregnancy proba-
blyhaslong lasting protective effects, since there
isclear evidence that longevity increases with the
number ofchildren borne. Inanimals, alarge
number ofpregnancies produces anti-aging, and
anti-estrogenic, effects that can beseen even iJ:l
theelasticity oftendons.
The amount ofirradiation needed toextend
theshelf lifeoffood isaround 100,000 rads to
300,000 rads oreven more, andeven that intensity
can't overcome theproblem ofdirty production
facilities. This amount ofradiation produces a
large amount ofammonia infood. Dogs fed
meat that had been irradiated were found tohave
severely depressed essential amino acids, and a
low level ofmagnesium, protein, andcreatinine in
theblood. Vitamin Aand other nutrients were
depleted.

Antiinflammatory and analgesic activity ofan
inhibitor ofneuropeptide amidation. Ogonowski
AA, May SW, Moore AB, Barrett LT,O'Bryant CL,
Pollock SR.. 4-Phenyl-3-butenoic acid (PBA) has
been shown invitro tobeaturnover-dependent inacti-
vator of peptidylglycine alpha-monooxygenase
(PAM), the rate-limiting enzyme involved inthe
formation ofamidated neuropeptides from their
glycine-extended precursors. Inthestudies reported
herein, wehave shown that PBA produces adose-
dependent (50-500 mg/kg s.c.) inhibition ofserum
PAM activity innormal ratswithout affecting pepti-
dylamidoglycolate lyase activity. Because amidated
neuropeptides such assubstance Pand calcitonin
gene-related peptide areinvolved inacute inflam-
mation, we evaluated the effects ofPBA on
carrageenan-induced inflammation inrats. The
acute administration ofPBA (s.c.ori.p.) produced
adose-related inhibition ofedema with maximum
inhibition (67%) observed at2hrpostphlogistic
agent. In addition, thecontinuous
ofPBA toanimals over a7-day period using
osmotic pumps not only inhibited hind paw
swelling induced bycarrageenan butalso inhibited
serum PAM activity and reduced tissue levels of
substance Pinhind paws. These results demonstrate
forthefirst time acorrelation between theantiinflam-
matory activity produced byaninhibitor ofpeptide
amidation with itsability toinhibit serum PAM activ-
ityandlower endogenous tissue levels ofsubstance P.
Moreover, these results confirm ourcontention that
PAM isanexcellent pharmacological target for
controlling theacute inflammatory response. Wealso
demonstrate theability ofPBA toinhibit phenyl-p-
quinone and acetylcholine-induced writhing inmice
without affecting thespinally mediated tailimmersion
assay inrats. Because this analgesic effect was
extremely rapid (within 15min), PBA may beproduc-
ingthis effect byamechanism other than peptide
amidation.
