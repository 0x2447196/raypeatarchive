SCHOLARS, THAT THEY OAN BE CONSIDERED MYSTICS IN THE IMPLICAC TION IS, OF COURSE, THAY "WYSTICISM" IS IN SOME WAY INNATELY GONNECTED WITH " INTOXICATION" .  R  GORDON WASSON HAS WRITTEN THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE UNION LINKS THE GREEN DORD FIGHAL VITH THE ROOT MYOO, PUNDUSI  'THAT FUNGI, ESPEC':ALLY MUSHROOMS, ARE USED AS INTORICANTS IS UIDELY NNOWN TO ANTHROPOLOGISTS,  IT IS WELL RNOWN, REGARDLESS OF UHAT EXPLANATION, IF ANY, IS  DIVEN, THAT NAHUATE AND RELATED LANGUAGES CONTAIN STARTLING, SIMILARITIES TO EUROPEAN LANGUAGES] FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROOT TGO AS USED, FOR INSTANCE, IN THE NAME OF THE SACRED MUSHROOM, TGONANAGATL, "GOO'S PLESH," IS OBVIOUSLY SIMILAR TO THE GREEK THEOS AND THE LATIN DEUSD.  ALTHOUGH IT CAN NOT BE OLAIMED TO BS MORE THAN AN EXTREME COINCIDENCE, A MEMDER OF THE YALOG UNICH USES THE SAORED MUSHROOM IS OALLED A MIKTEC, UHICH, WHEN PRONOUNGED IN NAHUATL, IS IDENTIGAL IN SOUND TO THE ENGLISH DRO "MYSTIC."    SUPPORT FOR WASSON'S THEORY IS FOUND IN THE "SONG TO DEMETER" IN THE HOMERIC HYMNS, " UHERE RHEA SAYS TO DEMETER (K)"TTP: MEANS: "MOTHER", SO DEMETER PROBABLY REPRESENTS "MOTHER EARYH!);  !'IBUT COME', MY CHILD, OBEY, AND BE NOT TOO ANGRY UNRELENTINGLY GITH.THE DARKECLOUDED SON OF CONOSIT DUT RATHER INDREASE PORTHUSTH FOR MEN YHE PRUIT THAT GIVES ', THEM LIPCOM. SO SPAKE RHEA,  AND RICHECROWNED DEMETER DID '' NOT REPUSE BUT STRAIGHTWAY MADE FRUIT TO SPRING UP FROM THE F RION LANDS." . ALYHOUGH THIS COULD, OF COURSE, REFER TO MERE VEGETABLE NOURISHMENT, THE LINES IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THESE BEEN,TO MAKE IT OLEAR THAT IT WAS SOME SORT OF VEGETABLE. INTONICANY THAT WAS GATHERED BY THE INPLIATES ON THEIR OVERNIGHT TRIP TO THE OGUNTRYSLOE, AND THAT WAS GARRISG BACK IN A BOX, PROM,UNICH IT WOULD BE TAKEN BY EACH INITIATES; "THEN SHE GRATI AND TO THE KINGS UHO DEAL JUSTICE, TRIPTOLEMUS AND DIOCLES, THE HORBEHORIVERS AND TO DOUGHTY EUMOLEUSAAND CLEUS, LEADER OF THE PEOPLE, SHE SHOWED THE CONDUCT OF THE RITED AND TAUGHT THEM ALL HER MYSTERIES, TO TRIPTOLEMUS AND AND POLYXEINUS AND DIOCLES ALSO,=="AUFUL WYSTERIES WHICH NO ONE MAY IN ANY WAY TRANSGRESS OR PRY. INTO OR UTTER, FOR DEEP AGE OF: THE GOOS CHEOKS THE VOLOE." ALTHOUGH THE ENGYCLOPECTA OF PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION INDICATES THAT, IN CIGERO'S VIEW, ATHENS PRODUCED "NOTHING DETTER THAN THE MYSTERIES OF ELEUSIS, NOT ONLY IN REGARD TO THE ORDERING AND CIVILIZING OF LIPE, BUT IN-REGARD TO THE FURNISHING OF A GOOD HOPE IN DEATH," AND THAT SOPHOOLES BELIEVED THAT "HAPPINESS IN THE NEXT WORLD" WAS CONFINED TO "***THOSE WHO HAD BEEN INITIATED IN THE MYSTERIES OF ELEUSIS, THAT IS, PROBABLY, SO FAR AG THEIR FELLOW-CITIZENS WERE CONCERNED" 2 THE "SONG TO DEMETER" DOES NOT EXPLICITLY IMPUTE A DOCTRINE OF "AFTER⇒ LIFE" TO THE MYSTERIES;  "HAPPY IS HE AMONG MEN ON EARTH WHO HAS SEEN THESE MYSTERIES; BUT HE UHO IS UNINITIATE AND UHO HAS NO PART IN THEM, NEVER HAS LOT OF LINE BOOD THINGS ONCE HE IS DEVO' DOWN IN THE DARKNESS AND GLOOM.  THIS STATEMENT, IT SEEMS, OOULD BE INTERPRETED TO REPRESENT SITHER A DENIAL OF AFTERPLIFE FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT INITIATED, WITH NO REFERENCE TO THE PUTURE OF THE INITIATE, OR A STATEMENT THAT : THE INITIATE WILL HAVE A SUPERIOR AFTER-LIFE.   THE DOCTRINE OF THE AFTER+LIFE WAS HIGHLY DEVELOPED IN GREECS, REGARDLESS OF UNETHER A PARTICULAR "MYSTERY" CONTAINED THE IDEA, AND PYTHAGORUS, OR RATHER, THE PYTHAGOREANS, WITH YNEIR IDEAS OF THE "UHEEL OF GIRTH" AND THE TRANSMIGRATION OF SOULG! (BOYH OF WHICH INVOLVED THE IDEA OF KARMA, HOWEVER IT UAS SXPRESSED) SEEM TO HAVE BEEN REPRESENTATIVE OF THIS O OCTRINE, AS CLASSIGAL HINDUISM, UITH THE GAME PARTICULAR IDEAS, WAS REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT DOCTRINE IN INDIA.  AL* THOUGH LITTLE SEEMS TO B E KNOWN ABOUT THE ACTUAL PRACTICES OF "PURIPICATION" OF THE PYTHAGOREAN BROTHERMOOD, THEY CAN BE CONSIDERED MYSYICAL, BY THE SAME CRITERIA WHICH ALLOW THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION TO ABSERT THAT , IN H INDUISM, INDEED, IN NEARLY ALL OF ITS MANIFESTATIONS, IN ITS MOST PHILOSOPHICAL FLIGHTS AS WELL AS UNEN IT APPROACHES PURE SHAMANISM AND MAGIC, THERE ARE TO BE FOUND INDIGATIONS OF THE MYSTIGAL TEMPER OF MIND." 2 ALTHOUGH HINDUISM IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE AN ASCETIC RELIGION, THE BHAGAVADEGITA CONTAINS WHAT SEEMS TO BE AN EARLY DOOTRINAL JUSTIPICATION FOR THE "MODERNIZED" FORMS OF     THE RELIGION, UHICH WERE MODIFIED BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE PRIMITIVE NAGA AND YAKSA WORSHIP AND THE COMPETITION OF LIGERALIZED SUDDHISM,  THE CITA SAYS THAT SOME YOGIS OFFER THEIR SOUL TO THE "SACRIFICIAL FIRE" OF BRAHMAN, AND OTHERS RENOUNCE POSSESSIONS, ACTIVITY, AND SENSE→PERCEPTION; HOW→ EVER, IMMORTALITY AND THE REACHING OF "ETERNAL DRAMMAN", BBBBBBBBBBB  THOSE WHO "ALLOW THEIR MINDS AND SENSES TO WANDER UNCHECKED, AND TRY TO SEE BRAHMAN WITHIN ALL EXTERIOR SENSE►OBJECTS. FOR THESE, SOUND AND THE OTHER SENSE—OBJECTS ARE THE OFFERING, AND SENSEHENJOYMENT THE SACRIFICIAL FIRE"!.  SINCE THE CLASSICAL HINDU TRADITION OF RENUNCIATION IS BOTH VERY WELL KNOWN AND PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL WITH THE MAIN CHRISTIAN MYSTICAL TRADITION, AND SINCE THE TANTRIC HINDU MOVEMENT CLOSELY PARALLELS THE "LIBERAL" BUDOHIST PRACTICES, DIFFERING MAINLY IN ITS ATTEMPT TO ",,,ASSIMILATE AND ADJUST ITSELF TO THE ORTHODOX TRADITION (RATHER) THAN TO EXCLUDE AND REFUTE IT," 2  IT  DILL  SE  ASSUMED  THAT  THE  DISGUSSIONS  OF  THE  MATURE MAMAYANA BUDDHISM AND THE CATHOLIC CHRISTIAN MYSTICAL TRADI→ TION WILL ILLUSTRATE YHE TWO MAIN TYPES OF MYSTICISM SUFFI  production O I E N T L Y ,  I , ' THE PACT THAT BUDDHISM HAS A GREATER REPUTATION POR BEING MONISTIC THAN HINDUISM IS REVEALED BY THE STATEMENT IN THE T ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE SOCIAL SOJEKCES THAT BUDDHISM HAS SPREAD INTO AREAS WHIGH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN CHRISTIAN, TAOIST, ZOROASTRIAN; ANO EVEN BRAHMINIST BECAUSE OF ITS PRACTICAL ` NATURE, ITS GOALS BEING PRIMARILY HUMANITARIAN, AND PSYCHOLOGY EING THE MEANS USED TO ACHIEVE THEM.  ACCORDING TO THE DEFINIE TION GIVEN BY YHE ABOVE, BUDDHIGM OAN BE CONSIDERED TO BE  , "MYSTICAL" IF IT MAKES USE OF SUCH PRACTICES AS "ECSTASY", "TRANGE'," AND "CONSOIQUSNESS OF THE ABBOLUTE," SO IT CAN BE SCEN THAT BOTH OF THESE STATEMENTS ABOUT BUDDHISM CAN BE SIMULTANEOUSLY GORRECT IP THE MENTIONED "PRACTICES" ARE UNDERSTOOD IN A MONISTIC SENSE, AND IF "HUMANITARIAN" IS NOT DEFINED TOO NARROWLY*  THE MONISTIC BUDDHIST MIGHT SAY THAT "THROUGH CERTAIN TAANCES-OR EXERCISES MAN CAN, IN AOCORDANOG QITH THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS, 1 OVERCOME IGNORANCE, AND THEREBY DECOME AWARE OF THE NIGHEST TRUTH AND EXPERIENCE THE HIGHEST DELIGHT, MAHAESUKHA."  THE PERSON WHO DESIRES TO "OVERCOME HIS IGNORANOE," THAT IS, TO BE INITIATED, NEED ONLY, AS IN THE PARALLEL HINDU AND GREEK RELIGIONS, BE ",",",INTELLIGENT,","ONE UHO ADSTAINS PROM INJURING ANY BEING, CONTROL  EVGR DOING GOOD TO ALL, PURE, ...AND A NONDUALIST...," THAT IS, WOMEN AND SLAVES WERE NOT EXCLUDED, AND COULD EVEN BEOOME GURUS, OR TRACHERS OF THE RELIGION. THE "METAPHYSICAL" EXPLANATION OF THIS ASPECT OF SUD ONISM IS GIVEN OV ZIMMER AS FOLLOWS: ...PURE COMPASSION 19 OF THE ESSENCE OF THE BODHISATTVA AND IS IDENTICAL VITH HIS RIGHT PERCEPTION OF THE VOIDI OR, AS ONE MIGHT SAY, IT IS THE PRIWARY AFFLEX OF THE VOID.S ..."

AND "HOU DOES BLAKE EXPLAIN ANY DIPPERENCE. BETUEEN HIS AND THE NORMAL EXPERIENCES, OR WHAT DOES HE SAY ABOUT THE NATURE OP THE NORMAL EXPERIENCES, OR WHAT DOES HE BAY ABOUT THE NAYURE OF THE WORLD AND OF MAN THAT GOULD ELUCIDATE HIS E EXPERIENCE?" AND "HIS BEING A WORLD#CENTERED MYSTICISM, and the state. POES BLAKE CONSIDER A WORLDLY ETHIC AND ESCHATOLOGY TO BE IMMEDIATELY (I.E., MAVING ALOAUSE OR EFFECT RELATION) INVOLVED VITH IT?" IN OTHER WORDS, THE THREE AREAS TO BE IN.. VESTIGATED IN ATTEMPTING TO OBTAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF . BLAKE 'S "MYSTICISM" COULD BE CALLED "THE EPIGYEMOLOGY, META" PHYSICS, AND ETHICS OF WORLD+AFFIRMING WYSTICISM."  BECAUSE OF THE PEOULIARITY OF BLAKE'S "SYSTEM," THE USUALLY DISTINCT AREAS OF EPISTRMOLOGY AND METAPHYSICS ARE ALMOST INSEPARABLE, THAT 18, EACH 18, TO SOME DEGREE, IMPLICIT IN THE OTHER. - IP BLAKE HAD WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF TRADITIONAL PHILOSOPHY HE PROBAGLY WOULD HAVE INSISTED THAT YHE THREE AREAS MUST BE UNITEDS AS IT IS, MIS UNNAMED AND SOMEWHAT HOMOGENEOUS EXPOSITION OF HIS "MYSTICISM" MUST BE ARBITRARILY DIVIOGD TO SHOW IT IN A GENERALLY POMPAEMENSIBLE PORM. THERE ARE ONE OR TWO POEMS IN BLAKE'S LETTERS TO HIS PRIEND THOMAS BUTTS UHICH ARE OLGARLY NARRATIONS OF PARTICULAR EXPERIENCES UNICH BLAKE CONSIDERED TO SE SIGNIFICANT.  BÉ→ SIDES THESE, THERE ARE IMPORTANT REFERENCES TO "VISIONS" SCATTERED THROUGH MILTON.  AS A BASIS POR THE SUBSEQUENT CONSIDERATION OP THESE DESCRIPTIONS OF "VISIONS," THERE IS " A MARGINAL STATEMENT IN BLAKE'S COPY OF BERKELEY'S SIRIS.  UHICH, ALTHOUGH THE WORDING IS NOT OOMPLETE ENDUGH TO ALLOW IT TO BE CONSIDERED AN EPITOME OF BLAKE'S "EPISTEMOLOGY," AT LEAST INDICATES ITS GENERAL DIRECTION.  IN RESPONSE TO  BERKELEY.'S STATEMENT UNION ENDS WITH THE SENTENCES "REASON ONSIDERS AND JUDGES OF THE IMAGINATION.  AMD THESE ACTS OF REASON BECOME NEW OBJECTS TO THE UNDERSTANDING," BLAKE SAYS: ,KNOWLEDGE IS NOT BY DEGUOTION, BUT IMMEDIATE BY PERE OEPTION OR SENSE AT ONOB,  CHRIST ADREBSES (SIC) HIMSELF TO THE MAN, NOT TO HJS REASON.  PLATO OID NOT BRING LIFE/ AND IMMORTALITY TO LIGHT*  JESUS ONLY DID THIS. I ACORDING TO THIS STATEMENT, "ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE," I.E., KNOWLEDGE 'ABOUT "LIPELAND IMMORTALITY'," IS TO BE GAINED SY MEANS OF "PEROEPTION OR SENSE," UNICH OLSARLY INDICATES THAT " B BLAKE'S POSITION IS DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE GENERAL POSITION I OF THOSE CHRISTIAN AND HINDU MYSTICS UHO, LIKE BEAKELEY, BE+ LIEVE THAT "THE PERCEPTIONS OF SENSE ARG GROSS..."2  THE 'ABOVE QUOTATION PROM BLAKE DOES NOT, OF COURSE, ",..BRING L L I P E AND IMMORTALITY TO L I G H T O N O R DOES I T SPECIFICALLY REVEAL HOW THEY WERE BROUGHT TO LIGHT FOR BLAKE, THAT IS I IT REVEALD NEITHER WHAT IS SENSED (WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED 'IN'THE SECTION CONCERNING NIS "WETAPHYSICS"), NOR UHAT HE MEANS BY "SENSE" (EXCEPT THAT IT IS NOT "DEQUOTION" OR  "REASON")} FOR BLAKE'S SPECIPIC MEANING OF "SENSE" THE E " " " REFERENCES CONCERNING "VISIONS" AND "MYSTICAL" EXPERIENCES MUST BE CONSIDERED. THE POEM SENT ON OOTOBER 2, 1800, TO BLARE'S "FRIEND BUTTS" REVEALS AN EXPERIENCE UNICH HAS VERY MUCH IN COMMON T U T U I T H THE EXPERIENCES DESCRIBED BY THE WODERN "PGYCHOLOGICAL WYSYICS," ALDOUS HUXLEY AND A. H. MASLOW (SEE CHAPTER ONE).  IN THE FIRST THELVE LINES OF THE POEM BLAKE INDICATES THAT I  ON THE BEACH , AND THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED YO HIM WHIGH ENASLED HIM TO EXPERIENCE THAT INCREASE OF "VISION," AND THAT I IT UAS SOME SORT OF AFFIRMATION OF SENSEI I LINGUI .. ..

ALTHOUGH THE NATURALISM OF "OPTIC NERVE" SHOULD BE OBVIOUS, IT IS LIKELY THAT "ARTIFIOIAL RICHES" WILL BE INTERPRETED BY SOME TO MEAN MATERIAL DEALTH, GITH THE RESULT THAT BLAKE WILL AGAIN BE PLACED, IN THOSE MINDS, WITH THOSE WHO "REJECT" THE NORLOL.

OF BLAKE'S MANY REFERENCES TO PLATOS MOST OF WHICH CRITIOIZE HIS BASIC PRINOIPLES BY SHOWING HIS PRYCHOLOGICAL AND ETHIGAL PALLACIES; TWO GHICH APPEAR IN HIS MARGINAL NOTES TO BERKELEY'S SIRIS ARE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT YO THIS DISCUSSION, BY THEIR REJECTION OF "IDEALISTIC," I*E+, SUPERNATURAL, PHILOGOPHY.

 21010. P. 108. THE LAST QUOTATIONS SHOW THAT THE "HELL" WHICH IS NOT CALLED / SUCH BY BLAKE IS ONLY THE "NON+EXISTENCE," THE DESIRE TO TRANSCEND THE EARTH, OF THE SUPERNATURALISTS, BUT THOUGH THE HEAVEN OF THE SUPERNATURALISTS IS BLAKE'S HELL, AND VIOE VERSAY BLAKE IS NOT A SIMPLE MATERIALISY.  IN BUDDHIST TERMS, BLAKE "QUIT TRYING" TO TRANSGEND THE WORLD AND "SUGGEEDED", THOUGH A MORE ACCURATE TERM, AS REVEALED IN THE PIRST SECTION OF THIS CHAPTER, WOULD BE "TRANSFORMED." I , , , , ON PAGE 83 OF THIS SEOTION, IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THE OENTRAL PART WOULD BE DEVOTED TO SHOWING HOW "THE COMBINATION OF YWO FACTORS NECEĞSAÑILY RESULTED IN BLAKE'S..." "MYSTICISM," I.E., HIS PURSUIT OF A SUPERIOR FORM OF CON# SCLOUSNESS.AS COLIN WILSON INDIGATED, AND BLAKE IMPLIED BY HIS POEM "TO BUTTG," BLAKE COULD BE CONSIDERED A "VITALIST"; THAT IS, HE BELIEVED THAT "LIPE" WAS A UNIVERSAL THING ("AN EXPANSIVE" PRINCIPLE OR FORGE) AND THAT HUMAN LIPE AND CONSOLOUSNESS ARE MERELY MANIFESTATIONS OF THE "CREATIVE ESSENCE."  PROBABLY A MORE FITTING NAME WOULD BE "PANTHEISM" J AT LEAST THIS NAME UILL AID IN THE ELUCIDATION OF THAT PART OF BLAKE ' S METAPHYSICS UNIOH CAN BE SAID TO DEAL UITH , U I THOUT DEVIATING MUCH FROW THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF THAT WORD, THE "ENTELECHY" OF ALL MATTER, I.E., THAT UNICH MAY BE CALLED THE ELAN VITAL, OR "CAUSE";  IN OTHER WORDS, THAY WHICH MAKES AOTUAL, OR REALIZES, THE MERELY POTENTIAL, AS DISTINGUISHED PROM THE PART UNION WILL POLLOW (MENTIONED IN SECTION ON EPISTEMOLOGY), V+2., ONTOLOGY, UHION I'S BY ITS NATURE, 11. In 111 VERY OLOSELY RELATED TO SPISTEMOLOGY.   A COMMON, THOUGH ENTIRELY ERRONEOUS, UNDERSTANDING OF "PANTHEISM" IS THAT IT IS SYNONYMOUS UITH "ANIMISM."  BLAKE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD ANIMISM GAS THE SAME AS HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD ANY DUALTSUJ IN "MOPHAMOH," HE SAYS THAT AFTER THE "LAS ANOIENT POETS ANIMATED ALL SENSIBLE OBJECTS WITH GODS OR GENIUSES AGALIZE OR ABSTRACY THE MENTAL DEITIES FROM THEIR OBJECTSI THUS BEGAN PRIESTHOOD...'  INOLUDED IN THIS SORT OF MISUSE OP 'THE WORD "PANTHEISM" IS THAT "PHILOSOPHY" WHICH MIGHT SE GALLED "HIGHER ANIMISM," WHICH BELIEVES THAT ALL NATURE, APPARENTLY'EXGLUDING MAN (WHO HAS HIS OWN SOUL), HAS A "SOUL": THE ONLY BIWILARITY THIS HAS TO THUE PANTHEISM IS THAT IT TENDS TO PUT NATURE ON A MORE MANELIKE LEVEL.  BLAKE, OF   T OURSE, 'WOULD REJECT THIS ATTITUDE BEGAUSE OF ITS DUALISM, AS HE WOULD THAT SLIGHTLY DIPPERENT FORM OF THE SAME DELIEF UNICH, ALTHOUGH IT IS SOMETIMES CONSIDERED PANTHEISTIC BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CONSIDER THE WORLD TO BE EVIL, LOOKS THROUGH, OR DEVOND, THE WORLD, TO A WORLD OF PLATONIC IDEAS, ETO, AND THE SAME "DORLOESOUL". A SECOND, AND SOMEWHAT MORE JUSTIFIABLE, CRITICISM OF AUD OF BLAKE IS THAT UHICH OLÁIWS THAT THE "VITALISTIC" POSITION OIMINISHES THE VALUE OF GOD, EITHER BY MAKING HIM IMPERSONAL, OR BY ASSOCIATING HIM BIJH "OUR LEVEL" OF THINGS. BLAKE WOULD DISAGAGE WITH THAT FORM OF PANTHEISM UNION WOULD REQUIRE THAT "GOD" BE WORSHIPPED AS AN ABSTRACT AND UNIVER → DALLY EQUAL PRINCIPLE RATHER THAN AS UHAT MIGHT BE CALLED  THE EXPRESSION OF THE VITALISTIC PRINOIPLE IN PARTICULAR THINGSI  WHEREVER ADSTRACTION EXISTS IT IS HATED BY SLAKE. HIS STATEMENT WHICH WAS STIMULATED BY A SIMILAR THOUGHT IN SUCDENDORG*S DIVING LOVE REVEALS HIS POSITION CLEARLY! THINK OF A WHITE OLGUD AS BEING HOLY, YOU CANNOT LOVE IT; BUT THINK OF A HOLY MAN WITHOUT THE CLOUD; LOVE SPRINGS UP IN YOUR THOUGHTS, FOR TO THINK OF HOLINGSS DISTINCT FROM MAN IS IMPOSSIBLE TO THE APPEOTIONS, ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION OF SLAKE'S BELIEF IN A PERSONAL GOD IS Minner of Heart we Hell FOUND IN MORHANDH , OHEN HE SAYS "THE WORSHIP OF GOD IS!  HONOURING HIS GIFTS IN OTHER MEN, EACH ACCORDING TO HIS GENIUG, AND LOVING THE CREATEST MEN BEST;  THOSE UHO ENVY OR CALUMNIATE GREAT MEN HATE GOD} FOR THERE IS NO OTHER GOD." THIS PREOGOING QUOTATION SEEMS OLEARLY TO GE VULNERABLE TO THAT ORITICISM OF PANTHEISM AS "DEGRADING GOD TO OUR LEVEL" I HOURVER, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE VORDS "HONOURING HIS GIFTS" SUGGGGTS A REITERATION OF THE IDEA THAT THE "EXPRESSION OF THE PRINCIPLE, RATHER THAN THE PRINCIPLE ABSTRACTED PROM ITS EXPRESSION, IS TO BE WORSHIPPED," WITH THE RESULT THAT SOMETH ING LARGER THAN MAN 'OAN GE CALLED "GOD+"  THIS IDEA U WILL BE PURTHER ELUCIDATED IN THE DISCUSSION OF BLAKE'S .. 89 ONTOLOGY, ALTHOUGH, 'AS SUGGESTED', THE STATEMENT AGOUT "NO OTHER GOD" DAS SOFTENED BY THE IMPLICATION OF THE EXISTENCE OP A UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE WHICH, ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT TO BE UORSHIPPED AS ITSELF, CAN BE CALLED "GOD," BLAKE'S TRUE "ANSWER" TO THIS SORT OF ORITICISM, I.E., YHAT "GOD IS  LOUGHED," IS GIVEN IN THERE IS NO NATURAL RELIGION (SECOND SCRIES) F AS THE SUMMARY OF A DISCUSSION OF "THE INFINITE," AS FOLLOUS)  "THEREFORE GOD BEGOMES AS VE ARE, THAT WE MAY BE AS HE IS." THE WEANING OF THIS SHOULD GE OBVIOUS:  THE "INFINITE" GOD, AG THE "UNIVERSAL ENTELECHY," I.E., THE ELAN VITAL, HAS GNTINUOUSLY AS ITS EFFECT MANKIND, UNICH, UNDER PARTICULAR "NATURAL", OIROUMSTANOES, CAN BE AWARE OP ITS INFINITE REAL NATURE.  AS THE ELAN VITAL IS OREATIVE, MANKINO, UHEN AWARE OF INFINITE NATURE IS CREATIVE. . BLAKE'S USE OF THE DORD "INFINITY" (AND "ETERNITY") WIGHT SEEM TO BE CONTRADICTORY TO HIS "ANTIEPLATONISM",  BUT IT IS OLEAR THAT HE DOES NOT INTEND THEM TO IMPLY UV IT PERSONAL IMMORTALITY, SUCH AS, FOR INSTANCE, THAT ARGUED BY ORTHODOX CHRISTIANGI  "INPINITY" REPERS TO A STATE OF "ABSOLUTELY REAL" PERCEPTION.  BLAKE SUCCINCTLY EXPLAINS THIS IDEA IN JERUSALEM? AS POLLOUSI AS THE PILGRIM PASSES UNILE THE COUNTRY PERMANENT REMAINS, SO MEN PASS ON, BUT STATES REMAIN PERMANENT FOREVER. SINGE A SIMPLE AND UNIVERSAL PULTALISTIC" IMPULSE IS THE SOURCE OF MAN'S OREATIVENESS, THE UNIVERSE CONCEIVED BY lKEYNES, POETRY AND PROSE OF WILLIAM BLAKE, P. ILB. GKAZIN, THE PORTABLE GLAKE, P. 1487. C. BLAKE WAS NOT THE "DISORDERLY" ONE THAT IT WISHT BE SUPPOSED . OHEN IT IS QONSIDERED THAT GAGH "IDENTITY" IS A "GOD"; I TO . BLAKE 16 NON PLATONIC AND THOROUGHLY MONISTIC MIND, THE ONLY  "GENERAL ADSOLUTE" GAS THAT UNICH HERE HAS BEEN CALLED THE "ENTELECHY"} THOUGH EACH "IDENTITY" IS COMPLETELY FREE, IT, AND ITS CREATIVE ACTS, ARE EXPRESSIONS OF THE "ENTELECHY" OF ITS MATTER; AND THEREFORE ORDERLY SINGE "ENTELECHY" IS "ONE"; "NO OMNIPOTENCE CAN ACT AGAINST ORDER#"I NEVERTHELESS, "EACH THING IS ITS OWN QAUSE AND ITS OWN EFFECT." 2 THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION OF THE NATURE OF "GOD" AND "MAN" HAS, TO SOME EXTENT, ANSWERED THE THIRD OBJECTION TMAT CHRISTIANS FREQUENTLY RAISE AGAINST PANTHEISM AND AGAINST BLAKE, VIZ, , THAT "PERGONALITY," OR SEPARATE IMMORTAL IDENTITY IS LOST: IN, OR NEGLECTED BY PANTHEIBMS  IT HAS BEEN SHOWN IN CONTRADICTION TO THIS CRITICISM, THAT EACH IDENTITY IS CONSIDERED TO BE A GOO, AND IS, IN A WAY, "INFINITE*" IT MAS ALSO GEEN SHOWN THAT, ALTHOUGH THE "COD" CANNOT TRULY BE SATDRYO DE INFERIOR TO OTHER SORTS OF GODS, SINCE THE "STATES," UHEREIN THE INFINITY IS EXPERIENCED, "REMAIN PERMANENT PORE EVER,” THE CRITICISM IS VALID IN ITS SAYING THAT PERSONAL IMMORTALITY IS LACKING PROM PANTHEISM.

HE SIMPLY, AS IN THE OTHER POSMS OF THIS BOOK, ALLOUS IT TO BE READ IN THAT WAY, SINGE HE IS ILLUSTRATING THAT POINT OF VIEW.  THE INTERPRETATION THAT IS SUPPORTED BY HIS OTHER WRITINGS (SONGS OF ERPERIENCE, MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN & HELL) IS THAT TWO ARE GRIGY— ING UNERE BEFORE ONLY ONE WAS, THAT IS, THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN D U U L O S  RATHER THAN SOLVED ,  THE "SONGS OF EXPERIENCE," BB "SONGS OF INNOGENCE", POINT OUT OTHER EVILO, BUT HERE THEY ARE NOT GIVEN AN AGGEPTABLE APPEARANCE; THEY ARE DIRECTLY STATED, AND A SOLUTION MORE OR LESS DIRECTLY GIVEN.

THIS VISIONARY MYSTICISM IS APPARENT AS THE WORLD VIEW BENIND THE POEM "THE HUMAN ABSTRACY" WHICH SPECIE FICALLY TREATS THE POLITICOERELIGIOUS HABIT OF PIOUSLY PRETENDING TO FEEL PITY AND MEROY, WHILE BEING REALLY THE CAUSE OF THE MISERY AND WARS AND ENJOYING THE DUAL NATURE OF SOCIETY,  THE POEM REGINS ON THIS SUSJECT, DIRECTLY AND S IMPLY 3. PLYY WOULD BE NO MORE IP WE OLD NOT MAKE SOMEBODY POOR! AND MEROY NO MORE GOULD OF IF ALL HERE AS HAPPY AS WE,  HOVEVER, THE GENERAL PATYERN OF THE POEM IS ONE OF AN APPARENT— LY CAUSAL SEQUENCE, PROM THE PACT OF RATIONALIZED SOCIAL DUALISM, THROUGH EXPLOITATION, HYPOGRYSX (OF SOME SORY), AND HUMILITY, TO "MYSTERY," THUS EXPLAINING, TO SOME EXTENT, 18  THE "MISTAKEN" MENTALITY ("...MORE) IS THE CRY OF A MISTAKEN SOUL; LESS THAN ALL CANNOT SATISFY MAN.",)  UNION ACOEPTS ITSELF AS BEING LESS THAN COMPLETE,  FOLLOWING THE L I N E  11 In 11 TING AND MUTUAL FEARINGS PEACE . UHICH IS THE LAST PART OF THE FIRST STAGE OF THE SEQUENCE, IS A LING WHICH IS SLIGHTLY AMBIGUOUS:  "SELFISH LOVES" IN  T THE TILL THE SELFISH LOVES INCREASE SECOND IS SEEN TO HAVE A NEGATIVE MEANING (AS DO PIYY AND MERCY) UHEN IT IS REMEMBERED THAT THE FOUR "VIRTUES" LISTED IN "THE DIVINE IMAGE" ARE "MEROYO PITY, PRACE, AND LOVE". 1  FURTHER    I MALE OR THAT STANZAT I  CONCRETE Man, 101 THAT THIS IS NOT THE "ORUELTY" (OR THE "SELPISH LOVE") OF AGYIVE PRIDE IS INDIGATED BY ITS USE OF A SNARE, WHICH IS AN Programming INACTIVE METHOD OF "WARPARE"; ALSO, THAT THE GRUELTY IS OF THE WEALTHY CLASS UPON THE POOR OLAGS IS INCICATED BY THE LINE FROM THE ROSSETTI-BIOKERING MANUSCRIPT,  "THEY CANNOT SPREAD NETS UNERS A HARVEST VIELDS."  THE NEXT VERSE SHOUS THAT "HOLY FEARS" (AND TEARS) PROMOTE THE GROPTH OF "HUMILITY ," ENICH APPEARS IN THE POURTH STANZA AS ",..THE GISMAL SHADE OP MYSTERY++" (THE "TREE" THAT GROWS"+++IN THE HUMAN BRAIN"). THAT THIS IS THE SAME SORT OF MYSTERY USED BY THE CHURCHES IS SUGGESTED BY THE LAST HALF OF THAT VERSE, T THE ARTICLE AND THE CATTERPILLER AND FLY FEED ON THE MYSTERY,  OHEN THE COMPARISON OF A "CATTERPILLER" OITH A PRIEST IN THE I " "PROVERBS OF HELL" IS REMEMBERED.

THAT SUBJECT IS, OF COURSE, THE APPARENTLY NECESSARY CONFLICT BETWEEN THE POROES OF MYSTERY AND THE POROES OF VISIONARY KNOULEDGE* THE PHILOSOPHY OF UNCORRUPTED INNOCENCE, THE "ANTI-AGNOSTIC" ARGUMENT OF THE "VISIONARY MYSTIC" + IS SPOKEN BY THE LITTLE BOY IN THE PIRST TWO STANZAGI *NOUGHT LOVES ANOTHER AS ITSELP, NOR VENERATES ANOTHER SO, NOR IS IT POSSIBLE TO THOUGHT A OREATER THAN ITSELF TO INOUS "AND FATHER, HOW GAN I LOVE YOU OR ANY OF MY BROTHERS MORE? I LOVE YOU LIKE THE LITTLE BIRD THAT PLOKE UP ORULIBS AROUND THE DOOR*" IKAZING THE PORTABLE BLAKE, P. 25H. THIS IS THE BASIC PHILOSOPHY, UNICH WAS OUTLINED IN "THERE IS NO NATURAL RELIGION," SECONO SERIES, ESPECIALLY NUMBERS V , VI, AND VII, AND IN SUCH STATEMENTS AS THE PROVERS IN THE MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN AND HELL? "ONE THOUGHT FILL IMMENSITY," APTER HAVING SIGIED THE ONILD, IN THE THIRD STANZA, THE PRIEST, AN THE FOURTH STANZA, OALLING HIW A FIEND, SAYS THE CH 1 L O 1 8 . "ONE WHO SETS REASON UP POR JUDGE OF OUR MOST HOLY MYSTERY$" IN YHIS CASE, "REASON," RATHER THAN BEING A "LIMITER," OR A "RESTATOTER OF KNOWLEDGE," IS MERELY A CONTROLLED PRESENTATTION OF THE PAOTS; ALTHOUGH IN THIS INSTANCE IY COULD NOT AG OTHERWISE, SINOE IT IS SPEAKING OF ITS OWN LIMITS, THE USE OP REASON IS ACOSPTAGLE IF IT IS REMEMBERED THAT, AS BLAKE SALO IN MULTON 9 ** OREATED TO BE ANNINILATED & A NEW RATIO CAEATED, 4 IN OTHER VORDS, REASON MUST BE MAINYAINED AS A TOOL POR DESCRIBING REALITY, E I THER OF THE IMAGINATION OR OF THE "WORLD," AND PREVENTED PROM BECOMING A SYSTEM OF EMPTY FORMWAE, WHOSE 2 Letton, P./ 254. 4 10 10. , Pet 438. 121 ONLY FUNCTION IS TO CONTROL, TO THEIR DETRIMENT, THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE:  IT IS UNNECESSARY TO GIVE AN OUTSIDE EXAMPLE OF BLAKE’S ATTITUDE TOWARD “MYSTERY”, THE CONTEXT OF THIS POEM BEING SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION, BUT IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE  SCME OF THE NALIES GIVEN TO IT, SUCH AS, IN MILTON, ....MYSTERY THE VIRGIN HARLOY MOTHER OF WARKS. , AS UAS TO SE EXPECTED, SINCE THE VISIONARY WAS A CHILD, AND THUG APPARENTLY NOT COMPLETELY "ORGANIZED" IN HIS INNOGENOE, AND THUS "QORRUPTIBLE," THE GHILD IS FIRST "AOUND ##IN AN IHON GHAIN" (STANZÄ,PIVE) AND THEN HE IS BURNED (LASY STANZA) PROTH A HOLY PLACE, T THE STATE WHERE MANY HAD DEEN BURN’D BEFORES THE DEEPING PARENTS WEPT IN VAID, IN IN THE PROFESSION ARE SUCH THINGS DONE ON ALBION'S SHORE? THUG, THE PORGES OF WYSTERY HAVE DESTROYED A PART OF LIFE,  BEOAUSE "INNOGENCE", THE "MYSTICAL" PART OF SOCIETY, IS INSURPICIENTLY ORGANIZED; IT IS TO REMEDY THIS GITUATION THAT BLAKE, SAID, "ROUZE UP, O YOUNG WEN OF THE NEW AGE!

(22) e letter p. 4115 ... THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THIS THESIS, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A MEANING FOR THE WORD "MYSTICISM," HAS TRACED THE ETYMOLOGY OF THAT WORD TO VARIOUS ROOTS WHOSE MEANINGS CONTAIN IMPLICATIONS OF INTOXICATION, SENSUALITY, AND SENSUOUSNESS, THE  HISTORY OF MYSTICISM IS FURTHER TRACED THROUGH TYPICAL ORTENTAL AND WESTERN EXPRESSIONS, AND IT IS SHOWN THAT REMOVAL PROM THE PRIMITIVE CONCITIONS OF WYSTIC RITUAL HAS GENERALLY RESULTED IN THE APPLICATION OF THE WORD (OR ITS  COGNATES AND/OR SYNONYMS) TO OPPOSITE REFERENTS, VIZ., WORLD T " REJECTING, BENSE REJECTING, SYMBOLIG VET INEFFABLE, "EXPERIENCES," OR, MORE ACCURATELY, "NON-EXPERIENCES," AND THAT, IN BOTH THE ORIENT AND THE OCCIDENT, REACTION AND READJUSTMENT TO THE GARLIEST SENSE OF THE WORD HAS DEEN ASSOCIATED WITH CONSIDERADLE SOPHISTICATION OF THEORY, AND APPLICATION OF THE RESULTANT TECHNIQUES FOR "AMELIORATING LIFE" TO SOCIGTY IN GENERAL, RATHER THAN TO A MORE OR LESS LIMITED GROUP.IT IS ALSO SHOWN THAT LANGUAGE AND SYMBOLS ARE 1. OLOSELY INVOLVED RITH THE "NEGATIVE WYSTICAL" PRACTICES, AND IT IS SUGGESTED THAT A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD SPOSIMPLICAMON FINI MATERIAL PRODUCTION IS CLOSELY RELATED TO, RATHER THAN OPPOSED TO, MYSTICAL ACTIVITY, IF THE "LIBERAL" SENSE OF THAT GORD IS USED, I HAM I S THE SECOND OHAPTER HAS CONSIDERED AND CLASSIFIED THE URITINGS ON BLAKE’S MYSTICISM, AND MAINTAINED THAT THOSE URITERS UNO HAVE CONSIDERED BLAKE'S MYSTICISM TO BE IN THE "WORLD REJECTING" TRADITION ARE MISTAKEN, AND THAT THE REASON FOR THIS CONFUSION IS THAT, UNTIL NEARLY THE MIDDLE OF THIS  range of the context of  GENTURY, ONLY STUDENTS OF MYSTICISM WERE AWARE OF A PRECISE DEFINITION OF THAT HORD, WITH THE RESULT THAT BLAKE'S IDEAS UERE, IN CENERAL, NOT CLOSELY STUDIED, IT UAS FURTHER MENTIONED THAT MERELY INDICATING THAT BLAKE'S WYSTICISM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE "WORLD REJECTING" SORT IS OF LITTLE VALUE TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF HIS IDEAS THE MATTE  THE THIRD OHAPTER, AFTER ILLUSTRATING THAT EL'AKE WAS AWARE OF A PERCEPTUAL EPISTEMOLOGY, STATED THAT THE SOURCE OF BLAKE’S "LIBERAL" OR "VISIONARY" MYSTICISM IS MAINLY IN THE COMBINATION OF TWO PHYLOSOPHICAL COMMITMENTS, VIZ* 9 VITALISM AND PERCEPTUALISM, UHICH INTERACT TO PRODUCE AN APPARENTLY WIDE VARIETY OF DOCTRINES (WHICH COULD BE ROUGHLY, OLASSIPIED BITH THE "ACTUALITY THEORY" OF HERACLITURA SPINOZA; MACH, AND WHITEHEAD), INGLUDING BLAKE'S "ANTHROPOMORPHISM," .. HIS "EXPAUDING SENSATION-EXPANDING PARTICLES" IDEAs MIG REJECTION OF SOTH THE PLATONIC AND THE NEWTONIAN TIME THEORIES, IN FAVOR OF AN EINSTEINTAN TIME THEORY, AND THE GLOGELY REchange LATED DOCTAINES OF UNBOUNDED "IDENTITIES," AND THE CREATION OF EACH THING, MOMENTARILY, BY ITSELF,  THE LAST MENTIONED DOTRINE IS MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD BY USING THE CONCEPT OF "ENTELECHY," "THAT OH IOH MAKES ACTUAL,"  FINALLY, 'IT IS MAINTAINED THAT, IN BLAKE15. "VISIONARY MYSTICISM," THE PARALLEL TO AN "ESCHATOLOGY" IS TO BE FOUND IN HIS "SOCIAL MYSTICISM," THAT IS, THAT INSTEAD OF THE "WAY" OF SELF..
