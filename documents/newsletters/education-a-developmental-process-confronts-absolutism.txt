Education, a developmental
process, confronts absolutism
Education has been associated with freedom
for a long time.  In ancient Greece, “liberal arts”
referred to the knowledge that was appropriate forthe full development of free citizens; technicaltraining provided the useful knowledge needed byslaves. In more recent times, knowledge of thesciences has been accepted as part of the educationof the upper classes, and common people havecome to see the liberating effects of a broad educa-tion. Recognizing the liberating effects of literacy,several southern states outlawed the education ofslaves. Something analogous to this attitude existsin the advocates of “efficiency” in education, whoargue that segregating (“tracking”) according toability, even dividing students into vocational andacademic courses, makes education more effective,at lower cost. 
Politicians, university presidents, and public
school superintendents, committed to efficiency,often give lip service to the idea of helpingstudents to develop their full potential, encourag-ing Socratic methods and focus on the students’needs, and most public school teachers believe thatis what they are doing—or trying to do, when theyaren’t just preparing their students to take one ofthe eight annual standardized achievement teststhat are required. Most university teachers, in myexperience, believe that their job is to facilitate thetransfer of a certain body of knowledge into theirstudents’ minds, and consider their few colleagueswith other views to be irresponsible. In practice,what is foremost in their understanding of thecurriculum is their confidence in its reality, rather
than a suspicion that it might not be quite appro-
priate for this generation of learners. 
Representatives of the most powerful people
in the world, typified by Klaus Schwab of the
World Economic Forum, WEF, are saying that it
is urgent to radically change education, toimprove it (again with lip service to all the besttraditional human values), and that the currentpandemic provides the opportunity for thesesudden changes. In the US, the closing ofschools and universities caused an immediateshift to obligatory use of the internet for classes.Some schools have announced that only certainclasses, compatible with “social distancing,”will be taught in classrooms in the fall. 
For Blake, the imposition of
“mind-forg'd manacles” by govern-ments, churches, and schools was theessential problem, which was to beresolved by mental combat, a refusalto accept unexamined opinion . 
In May, 2019, Eric Schmidt,  chairman if the
secretive National Security Commission on Artifi-cial Intelligence, former chairman of the DefenseInnovation Board, and until recently CEO andchairman of Google and still a major share-holder
and advisor there, revealed some of the commis-
sion’s recommendations, explaining the
urgency of shutting down the present economy,

year later, on May 8, 2020, Governor Cuomoannounced that Schmidt would be in charge of“reimagining” New York’s educational system,medical system, and economy. Two days earlier, inannouncing a partnership with the Gates Founda-tion to create a “smarter education system,”Cuomo implied that it would help the state todispense with “. . . all these buildings, all these
physical classrooms . . . .” (Klein, 2020).
“We must know all the facts and
hear all the alternatives and listen toall the criticisms.” John F Kennedy
The present ruling “philosophy” of education is
preventing people in the profession from organiz-ing meaningful resistance to these changes that arebeing imposed. The ideas of both John Dewey andJean Piaget regarding the nature of human devel-opment incorporated Hegel’s idea of movementtoward a final, mature, completed state, rather thandeveloping a continually stronger and strongerability to intentionally transform the self and its
interactions with its surroundings. 
If the teacher personally has a critical attitude
toward the world of experience, that will spontane-ously lead to a critical pedagogy, in which anytopic can only be presented as something with itsown developmental history.
The issue of freedom in education has been
developing for hundreds of years in associationwith the ideas of democracy and political freedom.J. J. Rousseau’s work developed the implicationsof replacing the doctrine of Original Sin with
belief in the innate goodness of all
 beings: "Every-
thing is good as it leaves the hands of the Author
of things; everything degenerates in the hands ofman.” If allowed to grow up without the deforminginfluences of the cruel, corrupt commercialsociety, people would be able to make the neces-sary compromises needed to participate in arational society. Despite his clear advocacy, in hisbook on education, Émile, of compromising thefullness of humanity in favor of developing goodcitizens, the politically dangerous consequences ofholding his new view on the nature of mind and ofbeing were obvious, and the book was immedi-
ately (1762) banned, but its influence spreadquickly in those pre-revolutionary years. 
For Rousseau, developing freely according to
nature must begin at birth; he rejected the tradi-tional practice of swaddling, binding the infant toprevent movement of arms and legs, and headvocated breast feeding: “. . . let mothers deignto nurse their children, morals will reformthemselves, nature’s sentiments will be awakened
in every heart, the state will be repeopled.”
Rousseau’s ideas contributed to the Romantic
Movement in the arts, and probably contributed tothe growing resistance to mechanistic materialismin science, such as in Goethe’s explorations inbotany.
In the 1790s, reflecting Rousseau’s influence,
William Godwin in England believed that a newkind of education that respects the child’s sponta-neous interests was necessary to make a new kindof state possible, a minimal state that respected itscitizens. In this same period, William Blakeagreed with Rousseau and Godwin on the need tocreate a new kind of society, but he stronglydisagreed with Rousseau’s theory of nature, mind,and education. 
For Blake, a constantly critical
awareness was part of the process ofbeing conscious in a living universe.
Blake saw the influence of Deism in
Rousseau’s thoughts:  A failure to question theCartesian doctrine of a nature consisting of inertmatter; knowledge as the result of a passiveempiricism; a created, rather than creative, nature.For Blake, everything in nature is alive, interac-tive, ongoing, and the perceiving person is an“intellectual fountain,” always moving into newexperiences.  “The bounded is loathed by itspossessor, The same dull round even of a universewould soon become a mill with complicatedwheels.”  In 1809, Blake commented on thoseholding the ruling ideology: “. . . who beingweakly organized themselves, cannot see eithermiracle or prodigy:  all is to them a dull round ofprobabilities and possibilities.”2Rousseau saw even free and respectful educa-
tion as requiring compromises, narrowing develop-
ment, in preparation for citizenship. For Blake,
the imposition of “mind-forg'd manacles” by
governments, churches, and schools was theessential problem, which was to be resolved bymental combat, a refusal to accept unexaminedopinion . Compromise would result in the oppres-
sion experienced by the passive clod, in “The Clod
and the Pebble.” For Blake, a constantly critical
awareness was part of the process of being
conscious in a living universe. 
The growth of technology led to the
extension of the trade school mental-ity into the universities in the 19thcentur
y.
It would be more than 100 years after the death
of Blake, Godwin, and Goethe before the implica-tions of a critical mind in an infinite world wouldbe explicitly applied to education theory by LevVygotsky, Myles Horton, Paolo Freire, and IvanIllich. During that interim, governments becameaware of the threat of any intellectual freedom inschools, and England began using the ideas ofUtilitarianism to promote “educational efficiency,”basing funding of schools on their ranking bystandardized tests. Pragmatism in the 20th centuryin the US didn’t differ dangerously from Utilitari-anism, and has been assimilated into the argumentsfor efficiency and cheapness of schooling.
The growth of technology led to the extension
of the trade school mentality into the universitiesin the 19th century. John Henry Newman, as
founding rector of a new catholic
 university,
dissented from those pressures as well as the
pressure to function as a seminary, saying that the
university “.  . . contemplates neither moral impres-
sion nor mechanical production; it professes to
exercise the mind neither in art nor in duty; itsf u n c t i o n  i s  i n t e l l e c t u a l  c u l t u r e  .  .  .  . ”   D i s s e n t  o fthat sort has tended, in the US, to become littlemore than a shift from a utilitarian or religious
curriculum to a “Great Books”
 curriculum, rather
than supporting a critical attitude of evaluating the
culture itself, and its curriculums—an attitudebased on a radically different perception of the
nature of mind and of being and becoming.
In the 1950s, arguing that there wasn’t enough
“discipline” in the public schools, there wererenewed attempts to make schools more “efficientand productive,” and the “psychologist” B.F.Skinner, who explicitly said that the idea of“mind” must be removed from the science ofbehavior, began promoting the idea that educationshould be based on his concept of “operant condi-tioning,” with programmed instruction that was tobe administered by a machine (Skinner, 1954;1961). Skinner’s concept of behavior and learningas mindless was realized in the programmedmachine learning that considered increasingrestriction and rigidity of behavioral responses tobe the goal of learning. The machines were said tobe based on Socratic principles of learning—as ifneither Socrates nor his students needed a mind.Schools began applying these methods widely inthe 1960s, and their effect was to increase the
irritation and resentment of students.
“The machine-like behavior of
people chained to electronics consti-tutes a degradation of their well-beingand of their dignity which, for mostpeople in the long run, becomes intol-erable.”  Ivan Illich
Some teachers who have recognized that
obligation is incompatible with full mentalfunctioning have refused to grade their students,and have found that they did better work thangraded students. A.S. Neill, in his school Summer-hill, made classes available, but didn’t requireattendance. Performance of their graduatingstudents, including on university entrance exams,compared favorably with students from conven-tional schools. Some universities have adoptedextensive use of pass/fail grading, replacing theconventional letter grade ranking, recognizing thatgrades are anti-educational. Students who havereceived good grades may be shocked when theyrealize that they haven’t understood some basicconcepts in the courses they “excelled” in.3As recently as the 1960s, when Horton’s and
Freire’s ideas (education to oppose oppression)were attracting attention, there was some discus-sion in universities of the potential of education tochange the values of students, leading to socialchange. It was understood that there were socialproblems that could be changed, and that educationcould help—an understanding that had becomewidespread since the publication of Émile. Butnow, in recent years, the idea of change has beenreversed—it is the teachers and the culture of theuniversities that are to be changed by society’s“stakeholders,” by the needs of “the economy,” toremove the “inefficiency” that remains. 
The campaign to privatize education acceler-
ated in the 1980s along with neoliberalism, deregu-lation, and privatizing everything except themilitary. A new concept of citizenship was beingcreated, as expressed by Margaret Thatcher:“There is no such thing as society.” Funding forpublic universities was being reduced, and theybegan forming “partnerships” with corporationsand concentrating on fundraising. 
Paolo Freire’s pedagogy of the
oppressed helped the poorest Brazil-ians to become literate in the fullsense of the word, and it can helpmiddle class Americans to develop thesame reality seeking attitude.
In the ’90s, one University of Oregon president
announced that “football is central to the univer-sity’s mission,” and the following presidentproposed privatizing the university, while concen-trating on football as a source of income and toattract big donors, specifically Nike. The univer-sity left the state system, to become an independ-ent corporation, meaning that its financial dealingsaren’t open to the public. It became a marketingand public relations tool for Nike. Similar thingstend to happen with charter schools. The Gatesfoundation sponsored a “partnership” of charterand public schools, financed mostly by taxes thatcost a billion dollars over seven years. A studysponsored by the Rand Corporation concluded thatit failed to improve education, and some analystssay it made things worse, but the Gates foundation
said it “drove change” in the country and theyplan to do it again.
Myles Horton’s Highlander School
wasn’t just a place for people likeRosa Parks and Martin Luther King;its critical, reality seeking, attitude isappropriate for anyone, anywhere. 
These changes have made “public” education
vastly more expensive for students (in real dollars,tuition at Oregon universities is 8 times higherthan when I was in college), and they coincide
with the concentration of wealth and power. The
pandemic, which has harmed most people, has
been very good for the oligarchs.  S i n c e  t h e
March 18 beginning of the lockdowns, until July23, the wealth of US billionaires has increased25.6%, more than $755 billion (Collins, et al.Institute for Policy Studies). 
To respond to this crisis, Klaus Schwab,
founder and chairman of the World EconomicForum, says that the virus will definitely return,and that the worst depression since the 1930s islikely to begin, so unprecedented changes must be
made. “To achieve a better outcome, the world
must act jointly and swiftly to revamp all
aspects of our societies and economies, fromeducation to social contracts and workingconditions. Every country, from the UnitedStates to China, must participate, and everyindustry, from oil and gas to tech, must betransformed. In short, we need a “Great Reset”of capitalism.” (Schwab, 2020; COVID Action
Platform). 
Increasing efficiency, higher performance, and
lower cost are the same educational goals theyhave been seeking, but what they have in mind isa radical shift to automation. The argument isbeing made that the best courses will be recordedto make them available, efficiently and profitably,to the greatest number of students. Then, theyargue that the introduction of virtual reality willmake the “best experiences” available to even thepoorest students—but designing the best virtualreality programs will become more and more4expensive, so the process must become more and
more centralized. Closing schools and firing teach-ers will increase educational efficiency, as well asprofitability, and will facilitate the production ofuniformity and controllability in the population.
One of the methods of controlling the
population, especially in the US, has been toconvince the great majority of the populationthat they belong to the “middle class,” and thatthey rank higher on the economic scale thanthey really do.  In 1960, in a graduate seminar, I
was shocked when the professor interrupted me toinform me that “there are no classes in the UnitedStates,” and so my presentation wasn’t relevant toAmerican literature. Everyone, they say, belongsto the middle class, there is no ruling class, andpoverty is a personal, not a public issue. If thereare no classes, how could oppression exist?
The lockdown of the mental world
seems to be succeeding in containingthe virus of critical thinking. This isincreasing the likelihood that the“Great Reset” will succeed.
Suddenly, many people are discovering that their
conditions are oppressive, though they aren’t ableto understand the causes, other than the “bat virus”that’s causing a pandemic. The existing educa-tional systems aren’t going to help them to under-stand their place in the world, but that is thepurpose of real education. 
Myles Horton’s Highlander School wasn’t just
a place for people like Rosa Parks and MartinLuther King; its critical, reality seeking, attitudewas appropriate for anyone, anywhere. PaoloFreire’s pedagogy of the oppressed helped thepoorest Brazilians to become literate in the fullsense of the word, and it can help middle classAmericans to develop the same reality seekingattitude.
In the 1960s, Ivan Illich moved to  Cuernavaca,
Mexico, and created a school where missionariescould quickly learn Spanish, but the languageinstruction was combined with learning about theculture they would be working in, and an examina-tion of their own culture and motives for doing thework; many of the students learned that they
wouldn’t be able to help anyone unless they
understood what these people wanted and needed .
Some of his students weren’t able to reconsidertheir belief that they were there simply to bring asuperior culture to people in an inferior culture.The assumptions of programmed instruction, andof the top-down educational “reformers,” aresimilar to those of the culturally blind priests whocouldn’t accept Illich’s methods—the program’s,the curriculum’s, existence represents the consen-sus of the best authorities, and criticism reducesefficiency.
Some education, distinct from training, has
been occurring in schools and universities, whenindividual teachers were able to communicate thattheir function was to critically evaluate the subjectmatter of the course, and that it was a process,involving the students, whose outcome wasn’tquite predictable. Those individuals won’t have aplace in the programmed instruction that is beingplanned and imposed.
The first step toward building a new civiliza-
tion in which education fosters the free and fulldevelopment of human beings has to be to stopthis mad rush of governments and their masterstoward isolation and standardization of everything
in the culture and economy.
The lockdown of the mental world seems to be
succeeding in containing the virus of criticalthinking. This is increasing the likelihood that theGreat Reset will succeed. With its success, theQualified people might achieve their dream ofeternal life in a technological paradise (if neces-sary, in orbit around a dead Earth); all theirimagined scenarios include artificial intelligenceas the survival factor.
Accepting their assumptions, the possible
outcomes are as predictable as the entropic deathof the universe; however, if their assumptionsabout the nature of life, mind, and the universe arewrong, their plans and expectations are wrong.Sensing that their arbitrary assumptions areindefensible, they must prevent criticism.  
Parents, regardless of the availability of
schooling, have an opportunity to promotecritical learning in their children, by asking5“where is the science?” to support the abroga-
tion of civil rights—where is the science tosupport staying home, wearing a mask, gettingvaccinated? Where is the science to show thesafety and efficacy of vaccines? Thosequestions will lead to more questions about therelative value of consensus, authority, data,logical consistency, and ulterior motives.
Anyone can become a spreader, or even a
super-spreader, of the virus of criticalthinking.
The first step toward building a
new civilization in which educationfosters the free and full developmentof human beings has to be to stop thismad rush of governments and theirmasters toward isolation andstandardization of everything in theculture and economy.
