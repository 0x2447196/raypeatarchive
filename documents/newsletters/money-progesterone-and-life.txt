Money, progesterone & life
The flow of money through a society is the most
powerful source of organization and meaning,generating real structures and the language used todescribe them. By 1940, objective endocrinologyhad been submerged by promotional articles inmedical journals.  
In the 1940s, while Alexander
Lipschutz was showing that progester-one could prevent cancer, andKatharina Dalton was starting to use itto treat PMS, the pharmaceuticalindustry was claiming that they hadproduced synthetic drugs more usefulthan progesterone during pregnancy,which they called progestogens orprogestins.  
In 1930 progesterone was shown to  support
pregnancy in animals, while estrogen was alreadyrecognized as causing breast cancer. By themid-thirties, governments and drug companiesbecame interested in estrogen (Nazi Germany usedit in concentration camps), while only a few peoplecontinued to study progesterone. Some doctors inthe 1930s were using corpus luteum extract, a richsource of progesterone, to treat pregnant women. Inthe 1940s, while Alexander Lipschutz was showingthat progesterone could prevent cancer, andKatharina Dalton was starting to use it to treat PMS,the pharmaceutical industry was claiming that theyhad produced synthetic drugs more useful thanprogesterone during pregnancy, which they called
progestogens or progestins.
In 1941, a synthetic estrogen, DES (already
known to cause cancer and miscarriages) wasapproved for medical use in women, and in thatsame year Charles Huggins began using it to treatprostate cancer—a Nobel Prize winning insaneidea. A few years later, DES was promoted byprofessors George and Olive Smith at Harvard totreat pregnant women; millions of womenreceived the treatment, leading to deformities andcancer in following generations. 
In 1942, the FDA approved Premarin (an
extract of horse urine containing about 50 kindsof estrogen) for treating “menopause” symptoms,with no evidence of effectiveness, and the assur-ance of the manufacturer, Wyeth Ayerst, that itwas safe. 
Encouraged by support from the estrogen
industry, thousands of articles in major medicaljournals falsely claimed that estrogen was effec-tive for treating or preventing hundreds of condi-tions, including miscarriages, strokes, heartdisease, and dementia.
The 1940s marked the end of
endocrinology as an exploratoryproject, and the beginning of thesocial-economic predominance of thedrug industry.
30 years after their approval of Premarin, in
1972 the FDA announced that it was effective,and in following years interacted closely with theindustry to shape the way estrogen is understoodand regulated. Government research wasRay Peat's Newsletter

Not for republication without written permission.designed to support the pharmaceutical industry, so
in 2002 the medical world was shocked when theWomen’s Health Initiative reported that their studyshowed that the combination of Premarin andProvera, a synthetic progestin, contributed todementia, strokes, clots, heart disease, and breastcancer.  
In 1942, the FDA approved Prema-
rin (an extract of horse urine contain-ing about 50 kinds of estrogen) fortreating “menopause” symptoms, withno evidence of effectiveness, and theassurance of the manufacturer, WyethA
yerst, that it was safe. 
Sales of Premarin and other estrogen products
decreased sharply, and millions of women beganusing natural progesterone. Breast cancer incidencedecreased substantially during the first few years ofdecreased estrogen consumption. Money beganflowing to researchers who would try to show thatprogesterone was responsible for all of the harmfuleffects of estrogen. My article, “Estrogen, progester-one, and cancer: Conflicts of interest in regulationand product promotion,” discussed a few of theearly examples.
In 1956, the FDA approved a n injectable form of
synthetic 17-hydroxyprogesterone (Delalutin) toprevent miscarriage. The manufacturer later askedthe FDA to cancel its approval, which it did in 2000.Another company applied for accelerated approval,and that was granted in 2011 on the basis of a 2003study, which had suggested that the drug might haveincreased the risk of miscarriage or stillbirth, withthe provision that another study be completed. Thesecond study clearly showed that the drug is ineffec-tive in preventing preterm birth.  On the basis oftheir 7 year monopoly granted by the FDA, thevendor increased the price per injection more than100-fold. At one point, in response to criticism, theFDA said that compounding pharmacists couldprovide the product at a more reasonable price, butmore recently they issued a statement tellingpharmacists that competing with the approved drugwould not be allowed, becau se it would undercut the
regulatory process. Animal studies have demon-strated that this so-called progestin  doesn’t have
progesterone’s protective effects on gestation(Nelson, et al., 2017), and human observations
have suggested that it appeared to have masculin-izing effects on females, and feminizing effectson males.
While fraud and thuggery have had their
influence on medical endocrinology, there havebeen subtler influences shaping thinking at thelevel of basic science. The receptor idea, createdmainly by government and the estrogen industry,has become entrenched in the general culture, notjust in the culture of endocrinology. It entered ourculture just as the “field” concept in biology wasdisappearing, with the receptor becoming one ofthe essential features of reductionist mechanisticbiology. 
During the last 200 years there have been
times when holistic thinking in biology led toimportant discoveries, especially in embryologyand physiology, but mechanistic thinking andgenetic essentialism have repeatedly submergedthose approaches. Thinking about progesteronehas been almost entirely confined to the mecha-nistic paradigm, and the result has been that it isgenerally miscategorized and misused. From theFDA label warnings, (based on toxic effects of
synthetic progestins ) to California’s OEHHA
cancer warning and Wikipedia’s definition, andcommon medical practice, progesterone isgrotesquely misunderstood. 
Encouraged by support from
the estrogen industry, thousandsof articles were published in majormedical journals falsely claimingthat estrogen was effective fortreating or preventing hundreds ofconditions . . . .
The idea of “generality” is where many
mistakes are made in science and medicine. Tounderstand a substance, it’s important to know, asfar as possible, its general properties. Forexample, carbon monoxide generally interfereswith oxygen’s biological actions; carbon dioxidegenerally acidifies and stabilizes cells. It’s possi-ble to refer generically to “estrogens,” “glucocor-ticoids,” “mineralocorticoids,” and “androgens,”since the body makes more than one steroid in2each group with very similar biological effects.
However, to say that there is a category of “proges-togens,” consisting of things which allow the uterusto form a deciduoma or to support pregnancy,derives from specific marketing policies of the drugindustry around 1941. It was the first step in a seriesof misrepresentations, which effectively blockedproductive exploration of the physiology ofprogesterone.
In 1972—30 years after approving
Premarin—the FDA announced that itwas effective. . . .  It was another 21years before randomized clinical trialswere started under the WHI to testthese beliefs about the use of synthetichormones in women.  
The drug companies and the “intelligence
community” have similar attitudes towardevidence—there is a story that they want to tell, andthey select concrete bits of data that form a mosaicto tell that story, ignoring the original ambiguity ofeach piece of the mosaic. The cultures of scienceand politics have become extremely authoritarian inthe way they limit debate and public expression ofthought. Every substance or process that affects thebody or the way people live is given a mystique bythese cultures.
The idea that certain lumps of tissue were
“glands of internal secretion” developed in themiddle of the 19th century, and for a time, somewriters recognized that everything produced by themetabolism of cells and emitted into the bloodstream could have an effect on all the other cells of
the body. Carbon dioxide was recognized as such
an internal secretion with effects on the body’s
functions.  Crude extracts of the adrenal glands and
thyroid gland were found to have important physio-logical effects. However, when a famous physiolo-gist, Charles Edouard Brown-Sequard reported thatsubcutaneous injections of a testicular extract had asexually rejuvenating effect, people were shocked,and denounced him as a quack. Later, when othersreported powerfully beneficial effects from extractsof the adrenal cortex, there was a similarresponse—neither of those glands, they said, couldcontain enough hormone to produce the effects
that were reported.
In 1940, Hans Selye and Christiane Dosne
described the adrenal cortex extract as being “richin the life-preserving prin ciple.” (“Effect of cortin
after partial and after complete hepatectomy,”American J. of Physiology 128 [1940], 729-35.“Cortin” referred to an aqueous extract of theadrenal cortex, containing many “hormonal”substances.)  The corporate endocrinologists ofthe period disparaged Selye’s work almost asvirulently as they did Brown-Sequard’s. The1940s marked the end of endocrinology as anexploratory project, and the beginning of thesocial-economic predominance of the drugindustry.
Selye, recognizing the presumptuousness of
classifying hormones according to what theydo, while their effects are still being explored,suggested that, until more is known, identify-ing them according to their tissue of originwould be more appropriate.  
. . . so in 2002 the medical world
was shocked when the Women’sHealth Initiative reported thattheir study showed that the combi-nation of Premarin and Provera, asynthetic progestin, contributed todementia, strokes, clots, heartdisease, and breast cancer.
In studying the physiology of stress, which he
called the General Adaptation Syndrome, Selyenoticed that the adrenal glands of pregnant ratscould be removed, without leading to death fromminor stresses, but that the usual stresses wouldkill them after they had given birth. Suspectingthat it was progesterone produced by the placentathat made the difference, he found that theadrenalectomized rats could live a normal, stressresistant, life span, if they received a regularprogesterone supplement. Since the “life-preserving principle” of the adrenal cortex extracthad consisted of a complex mixture ofsubstances, his discovery that the singlesubstance, progesterone, could replace it should3have aroused great interest in discovering the way
that substance affected every part of the organism. 
In Selye’s Syndrome, the adaptations are to
harmful events, such as infections or traumas, andthe hormones of the adrenal cortex, especially corti-sol and aldosterone, allow the organism to overcome
those, but with a cost—the chronic harmful effectsof those hormones. For example, cortisol causestissue atrophy, and aldosterone causes tissuefibrosis. Progesterone, besides substituting for theabsence of those hormones, protects against theirchronic degenerative effects, blocking, for example,both atrophy and fibrosis.
Sales of Premarin and other estro-
gen products decreased sharply . . .andmoney began flowing to researcherswho would try to show that progester-one was responsible for all of theharmful effects of estrogen.
Unfortunately, in the 1940s progesterone was still
very expensive, and the drug companies werepromoting the sales of their newly synthesized“progestins,” by claiming that progesterone wasineffective when taken by mouth, and could be usedonly by intramuscular injections of an oily solution.The medical journals, as well as drug salesmen,unanimously said that it was impossible for oralprogesterone to work, because “it’s destroyed bystomach acid.” Boiling it in hydrochloric aciddoesn’t harm it, but doctors were convinced thatonly the synthetic steroids could be used orally, andthose all had unpleasant side effects, such as mascu-linization, clotting disorders, cancer, waterretention, and blood glucose disturbances.
After I had investigated the effects of progester-
one in aging animals, I met a woman who said shehad read Katharina Dalton’s book about the use ofinjected progesterone, and convinced her doctor tolet her try it. She said she had recovered from opticneuritis and inability to walk as a result of the injec-tions. I was familiar with the ease with which oilysubstances can pass through the skin into the bloodstream, and I had noticed effects in the lab when Iwould get a small amount on my skin. 
Dissolved in warm olive oil, its effects were
immediate and dramatic, but it came out of solutionwhen it cooled, producing fine crystals. When a
particle of an oil-loving molecule contacts thesurface of the intestine, it is exposed to enzymessimilar to those in the liver, that preparesubstances for excretion; micronized progester-one is largely absorbed in that manner. Aftertrying many substances, I found that naturalvitamin E had a great affinity for progesterone,which is reasonable, since they are both protec-tors of mitochondrial respiration and antagonistsof estrogen, and must interact closely in stabiliz-ing cells.
Vitamin E is more slowly absorbed through
the skin than a triglyceride like olive oil, butvitamin E taken orally is absorbed, like the otheroily vitamins and long chain fats, by the chylomi-cron pathway that carries it directly into thegeneral blood stream, distributing it quicklythrough the body (Herrera and Barbas, 2001;Muller, et al., 1974; Anwar, et al., 2007). Thisdistribution process mimics that of naturallysynthesized progesterone from the ovaries.
Drug companies and the “intelli-
gence community” have similarattitudes toward evidence—there is astory that they want to tell, and theyselect concrete bits of data that forma mosaic to tell that story, ignoringthe original ambiguity of each pieceof the mosaic.
Although progesterone will dissolve in
medium chain triglycerides, MCT, that oil isn’tcompatible with oral use of progesterone, becauseit interferes with chylomicron formation, beingmainly absorbed by the direct portal pathway tothe liver (Ohshima, 1977; Borel, et al., 1998;Murota, et al., 2013), where it is quickly metabo-lized, activating fat synthesis (Takase & Hosoya,1986). The unique properties of this synthetic fatcould lead to the development of food allergies(Li, et al., 2013). 
I patented the composition of natural vitamin
E, progesterone, and appropriate triglycerides,and licensed it to Kenogen, which sells it asProgest-E Complex (info@kenogen.org).      4While progesterone happens to be a very
convenient supplement for an individual lackingadrenal glands when confronting stresses, thatdoesn’t explain its basic biological meaning, for
example  why it’s synthesized in the brain, where
its concentration is much higher than in the
blood, and why its synthesis and concentrationrise steadily during pregnancy, and why itsconcentration corresponds to the size of thebrain, and why birds and reptiles synthesizeit.  In viviparous snakes, it is thought to be responsi-
ble for the retention of the eggs, leading to livebirth, an anticipation of mammalian reproduction(Callard, et al., 1992). In plants, it supports growth. 
Biological adaptation has meanings much
broader than Selye’s. One sense of biologicaladaptation was influenced by Darwinism, in whichvariations in inherited traits affected an organism’sability to adapt to an environment. That “genetic,”relatively fixed, sense of adaptation has deflectedthe attention of biologists away from the changesthat the organism is always undergoing in anyenvironment. Exercise and learning involve biologi-cal changes, improving certain performances. Ourdaily physiological processes are continuallycausing small epigenetic changes, that influencehow we will react to future environments. 
Early in the 20th century, the embryologists
Hans Driesch and Jaques Loeb were trying toexplain the goal-directed behavior that could beseen in developing embryos, in which the organismcould overcome imposed obstacles to continue itsdevelopment. The mechanistic, neodarwinist side ofthe argument became the ruling dogma afterDriesch’s death in 1941, leading to denial of thepossibility of cloning and stem cells until the end ofthe century.   
The “entelechy” idea (the tendency to develop,
realizing potential) of Driesch and Aristotle hasbeen denounced as “vitalistic” and “metaphysical,”but it simply suggested that organisms exist asorganized substance with intrinsic purpose. Nothingsupernatural was claimed. Embryologists hadbelieved that if the cells of an early embryo weredivided, the two halves would develop as fragments,for example front and back, of a single organism,but Driesch found that each half developed into acomplete, but smaller, organism. The parts intendedto become an organism. Driesch's 1885 experimentcan be considered to be the first clone, or identi-
cal copy, of an organism. 
The mechanistic culture in science, which
finally accepted the possibility of cloning whenDolly the sheep was born in 1996, has retardedthe growth of knowledge because of its insistencethat there are no wholes other than the sums ofthe parts. The reason for its suppressive effect isthat it has imposed a metaphysical definition, adefinition that isn’t based on evidence, of what
matter is. That metaphysical belief that the
mechanists know, a priori,  what matter is, has
served as a barrier to perception and creativetheorizing.  It creates a state of mind in which, for
example, people think they are understandingsomething when they say that “progesterone is aprogestogenic steroid.” The premature naming ofits purpose forestalls consideration of what it is,and what it is becoming.
Thinking about progesterone
has been almost entirely confinedto the mechanistic paradigm, i.e.the receptor theory, and the resulthas been that it is generallymiscategorized and misused.
The sense of “adaptation” that derives from
embryology doesn’t deny that Selye’s adaptationoccurs, but it reverses the emphasis. Selyeemphasized the threatening side of stress, whileembryology emphasizes the constructive side ofadaptation, in which the organism is assimilatingwhat it needs from the environment, making thebest use of what it encounters. Relative to theintrinsic purpose of the organism, some environ-
ments are better than others. The organism,
moment by moment, is the judge of the
adequacy of the environment,  contrary to the
long established doctrine that inherited genes
determine the needs of the growing organism. 
Experimental animals that are given enriched
environments develop larger, more intelligentbrains than normal. These brains consume energyat a higher rate, making new demands on theenvironment. An important function of intelli-gence is to find or to create a better environment,creating a kind of momentum by positive5feedback. These processes occur during embryonic
development, during growth and education, and inthe process of self actualization generally. Thecuriosity reflex tends to become more central to theorganism’s life as brain metabolism increases.
I want to suggest that the
practice of calling progesteronea “hormone” has been counter-productive historically.
When needs aren’t met, development stops or
regresses, shutting down the most expensivefunctions, especially the curiosity reflex, and shift-ing resources to the more basic survival functions.The hormones of Selye’s stress reaction—cortisol,aldosterone, and estrogen—become dominant,shrinking muscles and immune tissues, reducingoxidative metabolism, and, if the process isprolonged, increasing fibrosis, cell type reversion ordedifferentiation (EMT), inflammation, and interfer-ence with cell renewal. Even if the adrenal glandsfail to produce an excess of the stress hormones,they can be produced in the brain. These anti-developmental, negatively adaptive, changeseventually lead to the various stress-related anddegenerative diseases.
In Selye’s Encyclopedia of Endocrinology,  h e
observed that progesterone can not only compensatefor an absence of the essential hormones of theadrenal cortex, it can also block the effects of anexcess of those hormones. It can block the stress-related degenerative processes produced by thosehormones, and it is required for the creative progres-
sion of the organism into higher states of being,supporting self-actualizing brain development. 
I want to suggest that the practice of calling
progesterone a hormone historically has beencounterproductive.  Like cholesterol, it is a cell-
stabilizing substance produced by cells, especiallybrain cells. Its concentration in the brain, like that ofcholesterol, increases with the size and quality ofthe brain, and corresponds to the quality of life. Itsfunctions go beyond those of cholesterol, shiftingthe way the brain responds to all sorts of stimulationand stress. These functions transcend the accidentsof Darwinian evolution, and are involved in theepigenetics of development, protecting against thedegenerative effects of stress, preserving the
higher levels of organization achieved throughexperience. 
The basic life supporting effects of carbon
dioxide are parallel to those of progesterone,and progesterone supports the production ofCO2, and the brain’s sensitivity to it ( Awad
and Alrefaie, 2014; Stekovic, et al., 2017; Szelke,et al., 2008).
The deliberate commercial slander of choles-
terol over the last 70 years has done damage,bodily and financial, equivalent to a continuingwar, harming people at every stage of life fromconception to old age. The misclassification ofprogesterone has resulted in direct damage,affecting especially developing fetuses, womenusing oral contraceptives, and post-menopausalwomen, who have been exposed to substanceswith long-lasting toxic effects called progestinsand progestogens. But besides these obviousaggressions of the drug industry, there has beenthe damage caused by failing to understand andtreat easily correctable conditions appropriately. 
The false claims and misclassifi-
cation of progesterone have donegreat harm . . . besides the obviousaggressions of the drug industry,there has been the damage causedby failing to understand and treateasily correctable conditionsappropriately. 
The role of progesterone deficiency in
epilepsy, depression, mania, heart failure, demen-tia, osteoporosis, neuropathies, myopathies,hypertension, pulmonary arterial hypertension,fibrosis, autoimmunity and glaucoma, has beenneglected, because of its classification as apregnancy hormone. Even in pregnancy, thatcategorical thinking has been responsible for theinjury and death of large numbers of women andtheir children.  
The behavior of the FDA in regard to proges-
terone and the synthetic progestins has culmi-nated in 2019 with the approved newpregnancy-related drug, Zulpresso (for postpar-tum depression) and the previously approved6Makena (for premature birth prevention), treatments
that are ridiculously expensive, and one of which isboth ineffective and harmful. If the FDA is shamedinto withdrawing its corrupt approval of Makena,the hydroxyprogesterone pregnancy treatment, thiscould provide an opportunity to reconsider its 78years of approving toxic hormonal treatments andmisrepresenting the effects of progesterone. 
Even if the FDA should decide to put science
ahead of business, there would still be the problemof the journals, and the subsidized research groups,who aren’t likely to stop their campaign againstprogesterone. Readers and consumers have tobecome aware of tricks such as using estrogenicsolvents such as ethanol in studies of progesterone.People who are going to have a biopsy or othersurgery can be responsible for either timing theoperation to coincide with the luteal phase whenprogesterone is high, or for using a progesteronesupplement before the procedure (Badwe, et al.,2011; Vasei, et al., 2006). There are too few physi-cians who are conscious of the difference betweenprogesterone and synthetic drugs, and of the impor-tance of progesterone, so medical consumers shouldbe cautious.
