Particles in Context
There have been, since the development of good
microscopes, occasional descriptions of microscopicfood-derived particles in the blood and urine ofpeople and animals (Herbst, 1844; Hirsch, 1905;Volkheimer, 1961). Preconceived ideas about thestructure and function of the body have caused thoseobservations to be ignored or denied. Volkheimerimmediately recognized that the presence of foodparticles in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid neededto be investigated, because of the circulatory andimmunological implications. 
In the 1960s, a North Korean researcher,
Bonghan Kim, reported the discovery of what hecalled a “third vascular system,” in addition to theblood and lymph vessels, in which particles contain-ing DNA were circulating. He suggested that theyconstituted a repair system for all the body’s organs.For various reasons, his reports were almostcompletely ignored; a few acupuncturists in the UScirculated one of his publications.
Just a few years ago, a few “western” research-
ers discovered that very fine particles circulating inthe blood and other body fluids, which they hadconsidered to be insignificant “dirt,” actuallycontained DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, andhormones, and that their composition varied withage and the state of health. There were also lengthsof DNA molecules circulating in the blood as freeparticles, and these particles, like the more complex“microvesicles,” were readily taken up by othercells. It’s now well established that these microparti-cles provide communication between cells, chang-ing the function and structure of the recipient cells.This communication constitutes part of the “epige-netic” process of adaptation.These discoveries have coincided with the
development of “nanotechnology,” in which, forexample, drug companies embed their drugs insmall particles, and clothing manufacturersembed silver or copper nanoparticles intogarments as deodorants, and cosmetics manufac-tures use nanoparticles to modify the texture andcolor of their products, and supplement manufac-turers use them as “lubricants,” to make theingredients flow nicely in their machines.  Thequantity of nanoparticles and microparticles in airand water from pollution has increased greatly. 
Our institutions continue to be
based on old biological modelsthat were adopted for reasonsother than their scientific validity,and those models are blind to theimmense harm being done by
new technologies.

implications of the persorption of alien particleseven before our endogenous particulate regula-tory system had been recognized. Recently,corporations and government officials have beenpublicizing their belief that there is no dangerfrom particles except when they are inhaled. 
In the first several decades following the
discovery of the danger of asbestos, industryprevented governmental regulation by saying thatthe harm hadn’t been proven conclusively. Whenit became common knowledge that asbestoscauses lung fibrosis and lung cancer, and thatforms of silica other than asbestos also causedRay Peat's Newsletter

Not for republication without written permission.lung fibrosis, the industry argument shifted to
saying that, although particulate matter has beenconclusively shown to damage the lungs, we have toassume that it’s safe for the rest of the body, becausedamage hasn’t been conclusively shown except inthe lungs. (The International Agency for Researchon Cancer, IARC, lists inhaled particulates unambi-guously as a Group 1 carcinogen.)
Biologists have occasionally noticed that
something they do to an individual organism, thatdoesn’t immediately cause major changes in itsdevelopment and functions, will produce seriouseffects in its offspring, and then in the next genera-tion, lethal effects. A group in Russia fed Monsanto-tainted foods to hamsters, and found that the effectsappearing in the first generation were more extremein the second generation, including infertility, andthat only a few survived in the third generation(Baranov, et al., 2010; Surov, et al., 2010; Maligin& Ermakova, 2009; Ermakova, 2008). The doctrinethat cells are controlled by genes, that acquiredchanges aren’t inherited, has made many peoplethink that it would be unreasonable to continuetoxicity studies beyond the life span of an individual
animal. The fact that epigenetic changes and
transgenerational effects are now well
documented, requires that environmental pollu-tion be interpreted in new ways.
 Many things that are now considered nontoxic
and noncarcinogenic are likely to be harmful whenexposure is extended transgenerationally. Impairedinfant brain development, allergy, and autoimmunediseases are known to result from a great variety ofcauses, ranging from radiation to mild chronicstress. 
The dogma that our being is determined by our
“genetic blue print” has guided social policy verybroadly. Doctors and public health officials, notlong ago, were saying that a pregnant woman’smalnutrition had no effect on her baby, if itmanaged to be born alive. If a substance didn’tproduce genetic mutations when cells were brieflyexposed to it, it couldn’t be carcinogenic. If acertain dose of radiation didn’t produce mutations, itwas said to be harmless. The genetic dogma washighly political; people who challenged it wereexcluded from the discussion. Despite the institu-tional power behind the dogma, the implications ofepigenesis are now coming to be recognized.    Life is adaptation, every adaptation involves
epigenetic modifications of the state of differ-
entiation, and every epigenetic change hastransgenerational repercussions.  T h e
Weismann Barrier, the doctrine of a “germ line”absolutely isolated from the “soma,” is as extinctas the Central Dogma of molecular biology. Thepublications that purported to demonstrate theembryological isolation of a “germ plasm” were,when I was a student, a shibboleth of mindlessgene centrism.
Life is adaptation, every
adaptation involves epigeneticmodifications of the state ofdifferentiation, and every epige-netic change has transgenera-tional repercussions.
   Every cause has effects, but those effects in
organisms are constrained by the purposeful flowof energy. V.I. Vernadsky’s and NorbertWiener’s work provides a context for anon-Weismannian approach to the problems of atoxic environment. James A. Shapiro and GuenterAlbrecht-Buehler have discussed some of thesepurposeful biological processes on the molecularlevel.
Several diseases that used to mainly affect
older people are now, in the last 15-20 years,becoming more common in young people. Thingsthat happened to their parents and grandparentshave probably contributed to their early suscepti-bility to those diseases, and if exposure to thosefactors continues, the cumulative effects can beexpected to get worse.  The increased incidenceof degenerative disease in young people is badfor those individuals, but it suggests (to peoplewho aren’t genetic determinists) that the outlookfor a subsequent generation is even worse.
The decrease of fertility with aging is well
known; for example, starting in middle age aman’s sperm count tends to decrease steadily,along with decreased sperm motility andincreased abnormality of shape. The recent trend,in most countries, has been for a progressivereduction in sperm quality even in younger men.2“Multiple studies over the past 15 years have
reported median sperm concentrations of 41-55 ×
106/ml in young men (mean age 18-21 years) from
the general population, suggesting that many ofthem have suboptimal semen quality” (Virtanen, etal., 2017). “During recent years, an increasingpercentage of male infertility has to be attributed toan array of environmental, health and lifestylefactors” (Kesari, et al., 2018).
The living state isn’t an
“all-or-nothing” matter; thereare different degrees of vitality. 
In effect, there is a premature aging or atrophy
of the seminiferous tissue. Things that cause tissueatrophy are likely to also cause cancer, so it isn’tsurprising that the rate of testicular cancer isincreasing: “Rapid increases in testicular cancerincidence have marked the second half of the lastcentury” (Znaor, et al., 2015); “Forecasts predictthat the incidence of testicular cancer will increaseby 25% in Europe by 2025” (Kudjawu, et al., 2018).
A recent report from the Centers of Disease
Control and Prevention indicates that between2014 and 2015, age-adjusted death rates in theUnited States increased for 8 of 10 leading causesof death, including cardiovascular disease rates(Xu, et al., 2015).    
    A  s t udy of the incidence of cancer in England
between 1976 and 1997 in young people, betweenthe ages of 15 and 25 (Birch, et al., 2002), foundthat the incidence increased by an average of 1.5%per year during that period. “Significant increaseswere seen in non-Hodgkins lymphoma (2.3%),astrocytoma (2.3%), germ-cell tumours (2.3%),melanoma (5.1%) and carcinoma of the thyroid(3.5%) and ovary (3.0%).” 
In the US, metastatic breast cancer in 25 to
39-year-old women increased from 1.53 per100,000 to 2.90 per 100,000. Since these womenseldom have mammograms, and since there is notendency to over-diagnose metastatic cancer, thatwas a real increase (Johnson, et al., 2013).
Cancers of the tongue and tonsil in young people
have been increasing in recent decades (Atula, et al.,1996; Schantz and Yu, 2002; Shiboski, et al., 2005).A new epidemic among young people is
inflammatory bowel disease (Malmborg andHildebrand, 2016; Molodecky, et al., 2012).Suicides among teenagers have increased (Pirani,2018; BCBS Health Index). 
Inflammation is involved in the chronic
degenerative conditions, especially atrophyand cancer, and even in depression  (Miller and
Raison, 2016; Udina, et al., 2012; Raison, et al.,2010). The incidence of several inflammatorydiseases, including atopic dermatitis and systemiclupus erythematosus, has been increasing in manycountries (Rees, et al., 2017; Kiadaliri, et al.,2018).
The “bystander effect” that occurs when
irradiation of one tissue causes similar damage inother tissues, or throughout the organism, is ageneral phenomenon that occurs with injuriesother than ionizing radiation. When a lung isdamaged with silica particles, cells removed fromthat lung, when cultured outside the organism,secrete into the culture fluid substances thatproduce similar injury, fibrosis, when cells from adifferent organism are exposed to that fluid. 
The finely ordered structure
of the living state is maintainedby the flow of energy. That flowcan be damaged not only bydeprivation of metabolic fuel oroxygen, but also by things thatdistort the structure. 
When particles of dust or smoke are inhaled,
the smallest particles (less than 1/10 the size ofbacteria) pass into the lungs, causing damagethere, but some pass through into the blood, andare distributed to the heart, brain, kidneys, liver,gonads, etc., damaging those organs, activatinginflammatory processes. The larger particles,including bacteria, are mostly trapped on themucous membranes before they reach the lungs,and are swept up by the mucus, and swallowed,where they reach the intestine, with potentialpersorption into the bloodstream.3There are macrophage-like cells in the intestine
that ingest particles such as silica, and, being unableto digest them, are likely to be inactivated, but in theprocess communicate an inflammatory reactionthrough the body. If the intestine itself becomesinflamed, the weakened barrier function allowsbacterial endotoxin to enter the bloodstream, ampli-fying the inflammatory and immunosuppressiveeffects. Macrophages damaged by particles andendotoxin can lead to immunosuppression (Keller,1976;  Radić, et al., 1988; Huaux, 2009; Kumagai-Takei, et al., 2011; Kim, et al., 2014;Freire, et al.,2013; Lotzová and Ritchie, 1977) while promotinginflammation. 
The process of inflammation and
fibrosis is initiated in response toanything that blocks the adequateproduction of energy.
Interference with energy production is funda-
mental to inflammation. When cellular stimulation
increases faster than oxygen can be delivered, thereis a shift to glycolytic energy production, with theconversion of glucose and amino acids to lacticacid. Small particles of silica or other inorganic ororganic material (such as plastics), can, like radia-tion, oxygen deprivation, sepsis, or estrogen,increase the production of lactic acid, and thislactate promotes various features of inflammation,including edema, collagen synthesis, and the growthand movement of cells.
Working in a photocopy shop, being exposed to
the toner particles in the air, evidence of geneticdamage appears in the urine, and exposing cells tothe fumes from a laser printer causes DNA breaks(Tang, et al., 2012; Khatri, et al., 2013). All of theknown “epigenetic” mechanisms (DNAmethylation, histone changes, and non-coding RNAchanges), besides the DNA breaks, are known to becaused by nanoparticles (Sierra, et al., 2016).
These changes can be caused by extremely small
amounts of invisible airborne particles, but thequantities that people are now exposed to are verylarge, and are increasing year by year.
Small amounts of nanoparticles can pass into the
skin, especially when it’s moist from sweat, fromfabrics that have been impregnated with them toserve as sun blockers and deodorants, and to
make them wrinkle resistant, stain resistant, andantiseptic (Bianco, et al., 2015; Crosera, et al.,2016; Filon, et al., 2011; Miquel-JeanJean, et al.,2012; Tang, et al., 2010).  Many perfumes,shampoos, cosmetics, and sunscreens containthem, up to 10% by weight, and are deliberatelyapplied to the skin.
Drugs and nutritional supplements
frequently contain microparticulate titaniumdioxide (a Group 2 carcinogen, according toIARC) and silica, to make attractive tablets.Those things are sometimes even included inencapsulated vitamins and powdered thyroid,to speed filling and reduce static electriccharges.  Toothpastes frequently contain titanium
dioxide for whiteness and opacity, and fumedsilica to give it a thicker consistency.
For many people, “foods” are probably their
main source of exposure to industrial particulatematter. The FDA allows up to 1% of the weightof food to be titanium dioxide, and up to 2%fumed silica.

   T h e  F D A  r e c ognizes the carcinogenicity of
crystalline silica, but they “expect” amorphoussilica to be noncarcinogenic. The evidence of thegenotoxicity and carcinogenicity of amorphoussilica is unambiguous (Guo, et al., 2017; Amre, etal., 1999; Wittig et al., 2017; Seidel, et al., 2017;  Fontana, et al., 2017; O’Neill, et al., 1986; Sinks,et al., 1994).
Besides the material that has to be listed on
the label, things that are called “processing aids,”which get into the food incidentally to theirmanufacture, don’t have to be mentioned on thelabel. For example, there are “food grade lubri-cants,” kosher and halal lubricants, which caninclude particles of fluorinated hydrocarbons,identical to the material in Teflon, as well asfumed silica. Silica is widely used in spray drying4foods, including milk, to prevent clumping of the
powders.
There are more than 100 different vaccines that
contain particulate aluminum hydroxide, intended tocreate a generalized inflammatory reaction, andsince the 1970s, the number of them administeredhas increased greatly. Word magic is commonlyused to obscure the nature and functions of theadjuvant.
The living state isn’t an “all-or-nothing”
matter; there are different degrees of vitality.The finely ordered structure of the living state ismaintained by the flow of energy. That flow canbe damaged not only by deprivation of metabolicfuel or oxygen, but also by things that distort thestructure. 
The fact that epigenetic changes
and transgenerational effects arenow well documented, requires thatenvironmental pollution be inter-preted in new ways.
Our so-called “immune system” detects unfavor-
able changes in the structural-energetic system, andreacts quietly to restore the system, removing abnor-mal structures, and facilitating the restoration offunction. When the organism’s situation isn’t good,instead of invisible restoration there isinflammation, a process in which crude provisionalrepairs are made, so that the damaged tissue doesn’tcontinue to demand resources that aren’t available.A scar is formed, a relatively inert fibrotic tissuereplaces the fully functional tissue. This happensprogressively with continued exposure to harmfulfactors, degrading the lungs, heart, blood vessels,gonads, liver, kidneys, brain . . . .
   The process of inflammation and fibrosis is
initiated in response to anything that blocks the
adequate production of energy.  Very different
factors can have additive or synergistic effectsleading to the same conditions of inflammation andfibrosis. Ionizing radiation, particulate matter, andestrogen excess interfere with the system in differ-ent ways, but all produce reductive stress, inflamma-tion, collagen synthesis, and loss of differentiatedcellular functions.The characteristic diseases of our
time—cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension,neurological disorders, Parkinson’s disease,Alzheimer’s disease, insulin resistance andmetabolic syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, kidneydiseases, and cancer (Pérez-Torres, et al.,2017)—-as well as trauma, shock, sepsis, andinfection, involve reductive stress, the inability tomaintain cell respiratory energy production, andits associated destructive inflammatoryprocesses.    Our institutions continue to be based on oldbiological models that were adopted for reasonsother than their scientific validity, and thosemodels are blind to the immense harm being doneby new technologies. Our organisms are undergo-ing continuous processes of adaptive changes inresponse to our pro-inflammatory environments,involving epigenetic changes that limit our poten-tials and that threaten to have cumulative effects
in following generations. Now that the effects of
the degraded environment are showing up in
deadly terminal diseases in younger andyounger people, it’s important for more peopleto start rejecting products and practices thatcontribute to chronic inflammation.
