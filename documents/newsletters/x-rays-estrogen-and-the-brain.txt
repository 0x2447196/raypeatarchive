X-rays, estrogen, and thebrain
Even asingle setofdental x-rays causes perma-
nent systemic damage.
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and ultra-
sound imaging aremucb safer tban x-rays and can
provide better images oftissues, andcanalso provide
detailed information about tissue functions and
metabolism.
Diagnostic x-rays fordentistry, formeasuring
bone density, formammography, forexamining the
brain, lungs, and heart, for"virtual colonoscopies,"
for sbopping mall whole-body scans, should be
abandoned immediately.
Their continued use isbased partly ontheir
profitability, partly onignorance, and partly onthe
fear oflegal liability forthe deatb and disability
already inflicted, ifthetrutb isadmitted.
The USPublic Health Service hasbecome deeply
involved inscientific malfeasance over thelast balf
century, andcanbeexpected tomarshal itsminions to
defend thepresent practices. Only public awareness
canstop theradiological abuses.
The excitation ofelectrons intbetissues byradia-
tion bas catalytic effects tbat produce long-lasting
cbanges inbiological functions that aremore impor-
tant than anyimmediate genetic mutations.
Activation ofphospholipase byradiation releases
arachidonic acid and DBA, wbicb actasbiological
signals. One enzyme activated bythearachidonic acid
signals isestrogen synthetase. An early effect of
irradiation istbestimulation ofcelldivision, and tbis
action isprolonged bytherelease offree unsaturated
fatty acids andtheformation ofestrogen.
Cbronic inflammatory changes, fibrosis, and
amyloidosis areproduced byionizing radiation, even
when the increased incidence ofcancer orbeart
attacks isrelatively small. Mental retardation, birtb
defects, senile dementia, immunodeficiency and the
degenerative amyloidoses must now betaken into
account inassessing thecosts ofradiation exposure.
Tbe changes produced byhigb energy radiation
overlap with those produced byexcess polyunsatu-
rated fats, excess serotonin, andexcess estrogen.
Antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiestro-
genic substances are protective against radiation
damage. Aspirin, vitamin E,progesterone, saturated
fatsandthyroid have these functions.Foracentury, science hasbeen barbarized by
greed. Early insights into thesubtle electronic
nature oflifehave been suppressed, allowing a
crude mechanical concept ofbiochemistry to
justify medical, military, and industrial practices
thatwere convenient andprofitable.
The observations ofGurwitsch, Crile, Tromp,
Bernal, Barnothy, Szent-Gyorgyi, andothers were
disregarded, because they would have required
science toconfront thephenomenon oflifewith
respect and humility, postponing thetechnologi-
calbio-engineering approach toorganisms, m
favor ofcaution andarecognition oftheprofun-
dityofourignorance.
Simplicity ISnice, except when asimple
model isclaimed toaccurately represent the
complex reality. The 20th century saw thetake-
over ofscience by reductionism, and--not
theCorporate State. The field
ofbiophysics ingeneral, andradiation biology in
particular, developed under the most extreme
economic andpolitical pressures, producing some
dangerous distortions anddelusions.
Intheearliest years ofthetwentieth century, a
few people like Thomas Edison had rejected the
medical useofx-rays, because they hadseen the
rays' terrible effects onthebody. Butbythe1920s
theUSmedical establishment was claiming that
radiation wasnotonly anessential diagnostic tool,
butthat itwas thebest way totreat more than
eighty different conditions.
Bythemiddle ofthecentury, there were two
views oftheway that ionizing radiation such as
thex-ray affects thebody. One wasthatitacceler-
ates theaging process, causing thedegenerative
diseases tooccur atanearlier age. Theother view
wasthatitcaused random mutations ofthegenes.
(Although some people held that somatic
mutations caused aging, there just wasn't much
interest inthescientific establishment inpursuing
thequestion ofaging.)
After 1945 theinfluence ofthemedical estab-
lishment coalesced with that ofthedeveloping
military industrial atomic energy clique, toargue
that ionizing radiation's "beneficial effects" far
outweighed thetrivial risks thatlarge doses could
produce. This medical-military culture found it
useful toargue thatthere was athreshold forthe
harmful effects ofradiation, andthat below that
dose, radiation hadnoharmful effect atall.That
threshold dose wasoften considered tobethedose
thatcaused radiation sickness todevelop within a
fewdays following exposure, inaway analogous
toasunburn that develops several hours after
exposure tothesun. There wasoften anassump-
tion thatthethreshold formutation ofgenes was
quite high, inthe vicinity ofthe dose that
produced radiation burns, but theoutstanding
thing about medical opinion regarding radiation's
harmful effects was itsfundamental optimism--if
atreatment made you feel better foracouple of
weeks, then itwas unquestionably good for your
health.
Ifanyone suggested thatcaution wasappropri-
ateintheabsence oflong-term evidence, that
person was adanger tothelivelihood ofphysi-
cians andathreat tonational security. Literally;
thatwasthetone ofthescientific-political culture.
Even someone asfamous asLinus Pauling was
ostracized forsaying thatitwasdangerous totest
atomic bombs intheair.Afewyears ago, oneof
theAtomic Energy Commission's chief apologists
forradioactive fallout inthe1950s, John Gofman,
described hisbehavior atthat time assimply
stupid. Contemporary observers who didn't have a
fmancial stake inradiation would have emphati-
cally agreed with thatassessment ofhisbehavior,
though atthat time they assumed that hewas
dishonest rather than stupid. Although hestill
thinks nuclear weapons aregood, hehasdone a
great amount ofgood inthelast35years byhis
careful studies oftheharmful effects ofradiation.
Butgovernment andindustry, andeven some of
hisacademic colleagues have done their best to
destroy his reputation. Stemglass, Tamplin,
Stewart, MacMahon, Mangano, andafewothers
have persisted intrying towarn thepublic about2
radiation's dangers, butgovernment andtheradia-
tionindustries have been able tolimit their ability
topublish, while investing hugely inacontinuing
campaign todiscredit them andtoconvince the
public that"alittle radiation isharmless."
When anyradiation interacts with asubstance,
theelectrons arethemost responsive parts ofthe
material, and some electrons aresusceptible to
being significantly changed even bylow energy
radiation, such asredlight. Astheenergy ofthe
radiation increases, more electrons aresusceptible
toactivation. Blue light interacts with more
electrons than yellow light, andultraviolet light
activates even the electrons infairly stable
molecules. X-rays andgamma rays will radically
disrupt electrons inallbiological molecules.
Several decades ago, itwas conventionally
taught thatvisible light is"chemically inert," and
that ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays are
"chemically active." Idon't think there was ever
any good scientific reason forthat dichotomous
belief, except that itwas obvious that themore
energetic rays were chemically active toadanger-
ousdegree. Blue light isnow known tobetoxic to
theeye,byactivating theoxidation ofpolyunsatu-
rated fatty acids; ithas been known tobetoxic to
various cells, including plant cells, formore than
50years. Intheeye,blue light creates freeradicals
inmelanin, which catalyze theoxidations. Other
molecules, including porphyrins and vitamins,
produce freeradicals when exposed toblue light,
ultraviolet, and the higher energy rays. For
example, riboflavin, vitamin B2,when exposed to
white light, cancause thevitreous body oftheeye
toliquefy bycausing thedepolymerization of
hyaluronic acid, and inthe skin itprobably
contributes totheage-related andsun-related loss
ofhyaluronic acid intheconnective tissue. Ultra-
violet light canattack thesame molecules asblue
light, butinaddition itcan dislodge electrons
from many more molecules, including thetrypto-
phan, tyrosine, andcystine inproteins.
The pro-oxidant effect ofriboflavin in
ordinary light isincreased byitsreactions with
tryptophan, folic acid, vitamin B6(pyridoxine),
andtyrosine (Grzelak, etaI.,2001). Higher energy
radiation causes aspreading excitation ofeven
more substances.
Although each partofanorganism hasitsown
complex ways ofresponding tothedisturbance of
itselectrons byradiation, Ithink it'suseful to
think ofsome simple physical examples ofhow
substances arechanged byradiation.
Some topaz crystals thatarecolored when they
aremined, quickly fade when they areexposed to
bright light. Over avery long time, natural radia-
tion displaced some electrons from theatoms in
theburied crystals, and trapped them in"color
centers," where they canabsorb certain frequen-
cies oflow energy visible light, creating colors,
without immediately escaping their traps. Bright
light can gradually free theelectrons from their
"traps," bleaching thecolor. Glass that was made
around 1900 often turned purple when itwas left
inthesun, because ultraviolet light had enough
energy tocreate trapped electrons inthatmaterial;
heating theglass toafew hundred degrees was
enough tobleach thecolor. Diamonds, salt, and
many other materials can becolored artificially
with high energy radiation, and they can be
bleached bythelower energy ofanother type of
radiation, orbyheating, orbyultrasound.
When trapped electrons are released by
heating, andreturn totheir relaxed ground state,
they give upenergy asthermoluminescence. The
amount ofthermoluminescence can beused to
measure thedose ofradiation thematerial was
exposed to.
The intensity ofthecolor induced byradiation
isanother way ofjudging thematerial's radiation
exposure.
Another way tomeasure theaccumulated dose
ofradiation istouseaninstrument that measures
theresonance ofunpaired electrons, color centers
orfree radicals, with amicrowave field--these
EPR orESR (electron paramagnetic resonance or
spin resonance) machines canmeasure unpaired
electrons inliving tissue, and can distinguish
different environments oftheelectrons, analogous
tothecolors seen intransparent materials.
EPR andthermoluminescence canbeused to
determine theaccumulated radiation exposure of
teeth, bones, and rocks. Since natural radiation
from minerals andcosmic rays issteady over long
periods oftime ataparticular location onthe
earth, these techniques can be used for3
archeological and geological dating. After radia-
tion accidents, tooth enamel canaccurately deter-
mine thedose received, except that theperson's
dental history must beknown, sothatdental radia-
tion can besubtracted from the accidental
exposure.
Inliquids, trapped electrons quickly return to
theground state, because ofthegreater mobility
ofatoms and ions inliquids, butwhile water is
being exposed tointense gamma rays, the
"solvated electrons" give thewater anintense blue
color. Inice, thetrapped electrons have along
life-time.
Inhair, skin, plant materials, andother tissues,
thetrapped electrons decay much more quickly
than inteeth and bones, buttheir effects canbe
seen for50years ormore, asforexample the
increased amount ofamyloid seen inJapanese
survivors oftheatomic bomb.
Hours after aperson hasbeen inthesunlight,
EPR can detect free radicals inthe melanin
pigment inhair. Intheskin, themelanin radicals
decay more quickly, buttheultraviolet-induced
spreading free radicals canstillbedetected inthe
skin hours later, during thetime inwhich the
sunburn injury isreaching itspeak. Applying
antioxidants and redlight toirradiated tissues
soon after exposure canprofoundly decrease the
injury. The beneficial effects ofsunlight are
largely theresult oftheredpartofthespectrum,
which penetrates deeply into tissues, andhelps to
inactivate toxic electrons.
When adose ofradiation similar toadiagnos-
ticx-ray isgiven tocells inculture, they arestill
emitting induced light after anhour ormore
(Vicker, etal., 1991). The genetic mutations
produced byradiation arestilloccurring hours or
days after theexposure; theobservations inthe
Japanese suggest that they might keep occurring
years after theexposure. Incellculture, they can
appear in unirradiated cells after 30
cell-doublings, the equivalent ofaperson's
lifetime. Inaform ofimprinting, theradiation
injury can bepassed toalater generation. The
radiation creates genetic instability, rather than
just immediate direct mutations. Stress andestro-
gen exposure cause genetic instability, probably
because ofthelingering metabolic effects, which
are similar tothose caused byradiation. The
metabolic changes causing delayed mutations
seem tobethose involved ininflammation
(Wright, 2004).
The electrons which arephysically excited by
high energy radiation areabsorbed byvarious
molecules, causing chemical excitation and
chemical reactions, which produce "chemilumi-
nescence" similar tothatseen after anyinjury. In
some cases these abnormally reactive chemicals
cause the familiar kinds ofdamage, such as
broken chromosomes orchain reactions oflipid
peroxidation inthepolyunsaturated fats. Various
stresses andmetabolic conditions areknown tobe
passed ontodaughter cells andtogerm cells and
offspring asalterations inthedegree ofmethyla-
tion ofcertain genes, butthis process of"epige-
netic inheritance" andimprinting hashardly been
investigated, because ofthefearof"Lamarckism"
that dominated biomedical research intheU.S. in
thetwentieth century.
Between chemiluminescence and theactual
biological processes ofgrowth, differentiation,
movement, inheritance, and disease there isan
immense zone ofignorance, that has been
excluded from organized scientific investigation,
because corporate financial interests have
preferred mechanical reductionist dogmas such as
"neodarwinian molecular biology."
The experiments ofAlexander Gurwitsch (or
Gurvich) andhiswife inthe1920s and1930s that
showed that growing cells stimulated waves of
cell division incells inanearby compartment,
separated byathinquartz glass partition, andthat
thestimulation occurred only when thepartition
glass was able totransmit ultraviolet rays, had
immense implications formedicine and biology.
Fritz Popp andMae-Wan Hohave validated and
extended thediscoveries oftheGurwitsches, using
new devices thatconftrm thenature oftheradia-
tion.
Everyone working with radiation now recog-
nizes that external ultraviolet rays, atdifferent
wavelengths andintensity, canstimulate orinhibit
cell division, and cancause cells todieprema-
turely ortobecome immortalized tumor cells, but
only avery fewresearchers, inthelastsixyears,
have begun tosee the intimate connections4
between ultraviolet light andthecells' systems of
interaction and self-regulation. The universities
have inculcated the doctrine that "radiation
damages bymutating genes." People talk about
DNA being altered when itis"hit" byradiation,
andeveryone who hastaken abiology course has
probably heard thatthe''target size" ofagene ora
virus determines thelikelihood that itwill be
damaged byagiven dose ofradiation. That quaint
relic ofprimitive radiation biophysics isuseful for
nuclear power corporations, andfordentists, and
foranyone who wants tosellwhole body scans to
thepublic. But that dogma hasnow been very
firmly knocked outbyhundreds ofdirect hitsby
experimental data, that show thatirradiated cells
transmit something toother cells that weren't
exposed totheradiation, ina"radiation bystander
effect."
Inthe1950s, Alice Stewart began aseries of
studies that showed that medical x-rays were
causing alarge number ofcancers inchildren. At
thattime, physicians were taught thatthe''thresh-
old" ofsafety forfetal x-ray exposure was ten
rads. (In animal studies, that dose reduces brain
size, andcauses mental retardation.) Inherfirst
study, sheand David Hewitt, astatistician who
hadnoticed that leukemia deaths inchildren had
recently increased by50%, found that leukemia
deaths were twice ashigh among children whose
mother-s had received pelvic x-rays during their
pregancy, compared toother women. Thesuppos-
edly safe dose ofahalftooneradwasproducing
those effects. Even asingle x-ray washarmful. If
thefetus wasx-rayed during itsfirstthree months,
theleukemia rate was increased 10-fold. Miscar-
riages, malformations andbrain cancers were also
more common inthe x-rayed patients. Even
having been x-rayed before pregnancy wasfound
toharm thebabies awoman would later have.
Stewart's study was widely denounced, andshe
lostherfunding andstaff atOxford.
Her results probably understated theactual
harm ofmedical x-rays, since thecontrol patients
who didn't receive x-rays were stillbeing exposed
tothe radioactive fallout from thetesting of
atomic bombs.
For many years, ithasbeen clear that low
birth weight (below 5.5pounds) was associated
with subnormal mental abilities. Recently, studies
ofwomen who had dental x-rays while pregnant
show that their risk ofhaving alow birth weight
infant was increased. Those whose radiation dose
was inthe90th percentile ofthegroup studied
were 3.61 times aslikely astheunexposed women
tohave afull-term lowbirth weight baby (Hujoel,
etal.,2004).
Estrogen excess during pregnancy isknown to
retard fetal development. The effects ofdental
x-rays onthebrain, pituitary and thyroid gland
probably played arole incausing thepregnancy
abnormalities, butanytissue which isexposed to
x-rays will tend tobegin producing estrogen. With
aging, most tissues begin toform estrogen
synthetase, theenzyme that converts androgens
into estrogen, and radiation accelerates that
process. Many years ago, researchers noticed that
x-rays orgamma rays would cause afemale
animal togointo estrus, asifithad been treated
with estrogen, anditwas assumed that theradia-
tion had stimulated the brain and pituitary to
produce gonadotropic hormones that activated the
ovaries. However, other researchers found that
simply irradiating ananimal's foot would induce
estrus. Radiation activates many ofthemediators
ofinflammation, including interleukin-6, which
activates estrogen synthetase.
Estrogen does many things toretard intrauter-
inegrowth and development, and most ofthose
effects areprevented byadequate progesterone,
which keeps estrogen outofcells even when the
blood level ofestrogen isvery high. Animals that
gestate under theinfluence ofexcessive estrogen
(ifthey survive) have asmall brain, and the
cortex, thehighest partofthebrain, isthinner than
normal. Just by acting on the mother's
metabolism, reducing herability todeliver oxygen
andglucose andother nutrients, radiation andthe
estrogen itinduces willdamage thefetal brain.
In thebrain, interleukin-6 isassociated with
cognitive decline, progressive dementia, soifthe
dental x-rays areacting primarily through the
brain, the mothers who bore under-developed
infants willprobably suffer anincreased incidence
ofAlzheimer's disease.
Ernest Sternglass and Jay Gould showed
clearly that declining SAT scores (especially the5
absolute number ofstudents reaching thehighest
scores) followed theintensity ofradiation from
nuclear fallout ineach region ofthecountry, with
alagof18years, indicating that thestudents
taking thetests were affected during their gesta-
tion.
TheNuclear Energy Institute, andother agents
and apologists forthenuclear industry, arestill
engaged inanintense campaign todiscredit
Sternglass, byquoting denunciations by"impor-
tant" newspaper editorial writers andgovernment
officials. (And byhiring ghost writers toprovide
articles forprofessors tosubmit totheir local
newspapers astheir own work.) Irrational and
dishonest "arguments" ofthatsort, unfortunately,
areeffective incontrolling thepublic's behavior.
Itprobably doesn't help thatthegenerations most
affected bythebrain damaging radiations arenow
attheage--41 to56--that hasthemost social,
political, andeconomic power.
Studies ofprenatal radiation exposure in
Japan show clearly thatitreduces brain size, intel-
ligence, andschool achievement (Fujiwara, etal.,
1994; Miller, 1988; Mole, 1990; Otake andShull,
1993; Shigematsu, 1994; Yamazaki and Shull,
1990)
Academic scientists know where their money
comes from, and so the enemies of
corporate/governmental/military science are
adopted asenemies byacademic science, and
students aren't given theopportunity toexamine
thealternative ideas.
The functions ofproteins aregoverned by
their complex shapes. Enzyme activity depends on
particular conformations ortheprotein, tocreate
catalytic fields intheright places. Theconforma-
tion ofthe protein depends onboth external
conditions (solvent andsolutes, pH,temperature,
oxidation-reduction potential ofthesystem, for
example) and internal fields within theprotein
itself. Simply changing thestate ofanelectron can
change thefunction ofanenzyme, leading to
widespread changes incellular physiology.
The cell, especially thecytoplasm, functions
asasystem, anddisturbance ofitselectrons will
affect itsystematically, modifying regulatory
processes atalllevels, and coordinating the
activities ofenzymes. Acertain intensity ofstress
will activate theprocesses ofinflammation.
Three important kinds ofenzymes that are
activated bystress and radiation arephospholi-
pases (that release fatty acids), tryptophan
hydroxylase (that controls the conversion of
tryptophan toserotonin), andaromatase (estrogen
synthetase, that converts androgens toestrogen).
The products ofthese enzymes stimulate cell
division, andproduce features oftheinflammatory
process, including theleakiness ofcapillaries.
Since these processes aresimilar, regardless of
thesource ofthedisturbance, thebasic antistress
and antiinflammatory systems that protect against
common imbalances (such asfluctuations in
glucose and oxygen) will also besomewhat
protective against radiation injury.
The thyroid hormone isprobably thebasic
protective hormone against radiation, asitis
against other stressors. Besides helping toprovide
theenergy needed torepair genetic damage andto
protect against calcium overload, the thyroid
hormones help todissipate excited electrons, and
-reduce lipid peroxidation andthechemiluminesce
produced byradiation. Adose ofthyroid 50%
larger than thenormal physiological daily produc-
tion canreduce radiation damage by30% to40%
(Antipenko andAntipenko, 1994).
Progesterone has antioxidant functions, as
well as suppressing the mediators of
inflammation, and inhibiting the enzymes that
produce freefatty acids (and theassociated prosta-
glandins), serotonin and estrogen. Cortisol is
protective against theacute inflammatory effects
ofradiation (Beetz, etal.,1997), butprogesterone
has those effects without thehannful effects of
excess cortisol.
Aspirin and vitamin Eareprotective against
toxic radiation, andtheconsequent inflammatory
processes.
Saturated fats have many ofthe same
functions, inhibiting inflammation, capillary leaki-
ness, andthefreeradical chain reactions.
Niacinamide, byreducing lipolysis, would be
another antiinflammatory agent that could help to
interrupt thedegenerative processes initiated by
exposure toradiation.6
Radiation stops repair processes inthebrain,
butthere isevidence thattreatment with anantiin-
flammatory drug (indomethacin) canrestore the
reparative process ofnerve cellformation (Monje,
etal.,2003).
The normal sequence inaging, proceeding
from inflammation toatrophy andthen todisor-
dered repair orcancer, isaccelerated byradiation
exposure. Harry Rubin demonstrated that cancer
precedes genetic change, rather than being
"caused bygenetic mutations," asthedogmatists
have claimed. The existence ofa"cancer field"
hasbeen known foralong time, butthedoctrine
ofthe"mutant cancer cell" hasheld that asingle
mutation, oraseries ofmutations, inasingle cell
isthecause ofallcancers, andhasdenied thatthe
cell's interactions with itsneighbors areresponsi-
bleforitsproperties. Recent radiation research is
showing that "inflammatory imprinting" precedes
both cancer andmutations.
Inrecent years, inflammation's role incancer
andheart disease hasbeen acknowledged tosome
extent, and simple antiinflammatory treatments
such asaspirin have been more widely accepted in
theprevention andtreatment ofboth heart disease
and cancer. Ithink thenext step istorecognize
theimportance ofpreventing allsorts ofinflam-
mation during thereproductive years, toprotect
thebrains oftheunborn, and theinheritance of
future generations.
If the Gurviches, and Fritz Popp and
Mae-Wan Hoareright, theinvestigation oflight's
role inlifehas hardly begun, and thepossible
therapeutic uses oflight haven't been imagined
yet. Their idea of"the coherent organism" is
giving anexpanded meaning totheidea ofa
biological "field."
But forthepresent, weshould know enough
toavoid allexposure tox-rays and radioactive
isotopes, and tomake sure that wegetenough
sunlight, without toomuch sunburn.

Photon reemission intheultraweak intensity range thatisobserved
after irradiation ofcellsuspensions with light, reveals characteris-
ticdifferences between normal human amnion cells and trans-
formed Wish cells from thesame parental tissue. The reemission
kinetics, approximated best byahyperbolical process, were
studied asafunction ofcelldensity, showing that: malignant Wish
cells have aphoton storage capacity that isnotimproved by
increasing thecelldensity; andthat normal amnion cells exhibit a
photon storage capacity thatstrongly increases with increasing cell
density. The interpretation ofthis effect and thenature ofthe
emitter arediscussed.

biophotons. Popp FA,LiKH. Mei WP, Galle M,Neurohr R
Institute ofBiophysical Cell Research, Technology Center,
Kaiserslautern, Federal Republic ofGermany. Bycomparing the
theoretically expected results ofphoton emission from achaotic
(thenna!) field andthose ofanordered (fully coherent) field with
theactual experimental data, one finds ample indications forthe
hypothesis that 'biophotons' originate from acoherent field occur-
ring within living tissues. Adirect proof may beseen inthehyper-
bolic relaxation dynamics ofspectral delayed luminescence under
ergodic conditions. Apossible mechanism hastobefounded on
Einstein's balance equation and, under stationary conditions, on
energy conservation including aphotochemical potential. Itis
shown that theconsidered equations deliver, besides thethermal
equilibrium, aconditionaJIy stable region far away from equilib-
rium, which can help todescribe both 'biophoton emission' and
biological regulation.

New evidence forcoherence and DNA assource. Popp FA.,Nagl
W,LiKH, Scholz W,Weingartner 0,WolfR. Thephenomenon of
ultraweak photon emission from living systems wasfurther investi-
gated inorder toelucidate thephysical properties ofthisradiation
and itspossible source. Weobtained evidence that thelight hasa
high degree ofcoherence because of(I)itsphoton count statistics,
(2)itsspectral distribution, (3)itsdecay behavior after exposure to
light illumination, and(4)itstransparency through optically thick
materials. Moreover, DNA isapparently atleast animportant
source, since conformational changes induced with ethidium
bromide invivo areclearly reflected bychanges ofthephoton
emission ofcells. The physical properties oftheradiation are
described, taking DNA asanexciplex laser system, where astable
state canbereached farfrom thermal equilibrium atthreshold.

(electromagnetic) model ofdifferentiation. 1.Basic considera-
tions. Nag] W,Popp FA. There are anumber ofbiological
phenomena and events that cannot yetbeadequately described,
such ascellgrowth anddifferentiation, which may becontrolled by
physical factors. Frohlich (1980) hasdiscussed theprinciples of
dissipative structures asapplied toelectromagnetic interactions in
relation tobasic couplings inbiological systems. Recently, increas-
ingevidence ofphoton storage and ultraweak photon emission
from living systems, particularly from DNA., has suggested the
concept ofanelectromagnetic model ofdifferentiation, based on
theknown quantum optical properties ofnucleic acids. This model
has theadvantage over aJIideas sofarpublished, that itis(I)
simple; (2) universally applicable toevents inliving matter,
because itisconsistent with both thequantum mechanical andthe
thermodynamic properties ontheonehand, andtheknown biologi-
caland biochemical data and phenomena attheother hand; (3)it
not only describes thephenomena and events interms ofpure
mathematical r>arameters, butitcanalso explain them; and (4)it
escapes thedifficulty offinding basic control mechanisms, which
themselves donotneed aregulator, adinfinitum.

Examples. Popp FA., Nag] W.The electromagnetic model ofcell
differentiation originated byNagl andPopp (1983) was applied to
two biological events, chromatin condensation andphotoperiodic-
ity(oscillations). Some experiments aresuggested, which may help
torefute orveruy, respectively, the role ofultraweak photon
emission indifferentiation andthecontrol ofgene activity.

[Experimental investigations on ultraweak photonemission
form biological systems) Ruth B,Popp FA. Measurements on
untreated yeast cells, potato- and cucumber seedlings have
confirmed the existence ofphoton emission from biological
systems known as"ultraweak luminescence". The intensity isof
theorder ofI0(2) counts persecond, andthespectral distrubtion
shows amaximum near 550 DID. The dependence ofthphoton
emission oncertain chemicals hasbeen investigated. Some chemi-
cals. asforinstance acetone, intensify thephoton emission from
cucumber seedlings without essential change ofthespectral distri-
bution. Ontheother hand, NaCI leads toashift totheredregion
of the spectrum. The treatment of EAT -cells by
4-Hydroperoxycyclofosfamide involves anonlinear enhancement
oftheintensity with increasing concentration. There aresome
indications that collective interactions ofthesystem aremore
appropriate than simple chemiluminescence reactions.
