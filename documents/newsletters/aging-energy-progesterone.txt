Aging, Energy, Progesterone
In 1935 when Clive McKay’s group began
its study of caloric restriction and life-span
extension, the “rate of living” theory of aging
dominated thinking. In repeated studies,McKay made it clear that it was only theamount of energy metabolized, rather than theabsence of particular substances, thataccounted for longer life when the total energyof the diet was restricted. In a common versionof the rate of living theory, it was oxidativedamage necessarily produced by the respiringmitochondria that produced the “wear andtear” of living. From the beginning of the 20thcentury, a popular idea was that the accumula-tion of an inert or toxic “metaplasm” in cells inproportion to their metabolic rate accountedfor the aging process. The accumulation of“age pigment,” lipofuscin, in proportion to thepresence of polyunsaturated fats, heavy metals,and oxygen tends to support the idea of agingas accumulation of metabolic waste—and tochallenge the idea that energy-metabolismitself causes aging. The essential amino acidswere among the nutrients causing lipofuscin toaccumulate.
If metabolizing “pure energy” is the cause
of aging, all of the substances known tocontribute to the formation of metaplasm orlipofuscin are irreleva nt, so the composition of
food can’t affect the rate of aging.The rate of living theory was gradually
being proven wrong in a variety of ways, asanimals with a higher metabolic rate turnedout to generally live longer than those with alower metabolic rate, but it has becomeentrenched in the nutritional doctrines of thecaloric restriction life-extension culture, andhas blended into the durable sugar-phobicculture, in which excess sugar is seen as themajor factor in the development of diabetes,cancer, heart disease, and and nerve degenera-tion, including dementia. In recent years,many studies have shown protective effects ofdiets with a lower ratio of protein tocarbohydrate.
Biochemically, the closest cells can come
to metabolizing pure energy (the basic causeof aging according to the rate of living theory)is when they are responding to the  ATP deliv-ered by glucose (Chaudhari and Kipreos,2018), defined as a high Respiratory Quotient,
as opposed to the lower ratio when fat oramino acids are oxidized for energy.  As therate of living theory has taken over, with“logical” arguments, the actual measurementof oxygen consumpti on and CO2 production
has been discouraged, and replaced by newtechnologies that estimate them without directmeasurement—for example, the doublylabeled water isotope m ethod and the proprie-
tary Agilent “Seahorse XF Analyzer” technol-ogy. To the extent that physiologicalmeasurements are important for science and

Has “evolution” increased the efficiency of
respiratory energy production, and is energeticefficiency of energy production a good thing?Within the rate of living theory of aging, thoseare common opinions. A maximum of fatstorage on a minimum of food consumption isan example of high efficiency. The highly“wasteful” inefficient energy metabolism of“uncoupled” mitochondria improves adaptabil-ity to the environments, and extends longevity.
In some fields, the need  to hide failures of a
belief system has produced very bad results.“In altitude studies, for example, it is generallyaccepted that mitochondrial volume density inhuman skeletal muscle d iminishes with chronic
high altitude exposure” (Jacobs, et al., 2018),but this result was caused by failure to accountfor the catabolic effects of the mountainenvironment, and the real effect of altitudehypoxia itself is the opposite, viz., mass skele-tal muscle mitochondrial volume densityincreases in response to high altitude exposure.
This particular feature of high altitude
physiology is very impor tant for understanding
the life-prolonging effect of living at highaltitude. Aging corresponds closely to thedecline of tissue mitochondrial mass, andthings that preserve or restore mitochondriacan preserve or restore tissue metabolism.
When investigating the effects of a lower
ratio of protein to carbohydrate, it has beenfound that certain amino acids account formost of the protective effects of reducingdietary protein, especially methionine andtryptophan. This accounts for the main protec-tive effects of gelatin in the diet, since thisprotein is deficient in methionine, cysteine,and tryptophan, the main anti-metabolic aminoacids.
There is a threshold effect in exposure to
the harmful amino acids, and this involves avery sensitive system for detecting theirconcentration, apparently involving the actin
filament network throughout the body. Abovethe threshold concentration, methionineactivates mTOR. Increased mTOR shortenslife-span and increases the processes of aging.Increased fat in the diet increases mTOR,adding to the effects of amino acids. Severalsubstances block the increase of mTOR,including the citrus flavonoid nobiletin,aspirin, and progesterone. Nobiletin preservesmitochondrial glucose metabolism, whileprotecting against the anti-metabolic effects offat (Nohara, et al., 2019).
The way these regulators of energy and
aging interact is holistic, and it’s necessary tounderstand that organisms make generaliza-tions about their problem s. Things that inhibit
mTOR will increase adaptation and organiza-tion with expansion of the time horizon, whilethings that activate it (methionine, estrogen,radiation) will accelerate cell growth andinflammation and activate terminal processes.Progesterone and estrogen relate to the degreeof mTOR activity through the body as awhole, not just through a series of receptorintermediates.
A high RQ, oxidizing mostly glucose, is so
harmful, according to present metabolicconsensus, that it would seem logical toemphasize the importance of the simple oldBMR studies, measuring CO2 produced andoxygen consumed, but these have beenabandoned in favor of complex newtechniques, which replace measurements withestimates of those quantities (doubly labeledwater isotope measurement, and the proprie-tary “Seahorse” apparatus).  I suspect that theweight of the simple facts of oxygenconsumption was so disruptive to the newermethods of treating hypothyroidism that theyeliminated the use of the tests, instead offinding real justification for their practices.Oxygen consumption is  no longer understood
in the medical culture to be the basis for thephysiological effects of thyroid hormone.
2The high energy represented by the ATP
produced by oxidation of glucose is obviouslyessential for maintaining the essential featuresof life, and it is the system suppressed in anorganized way by activation of mTOR, result-ing from imbalances in the available nutrients.Progesterone’s roles in this energy systemhave been seen to be crucial in pregnancy, andin protection against stress and degeneration,but its official categorization as a sex hormonehas blocked insight into its real centralfunctions.
For about 50 years, a dogmatic view of
hormones has been that they act throughnuclear receptors to activate the genes thatexplain their functions. Two such receptors,PRA and PRB, were identified, but failed toexplain any of proge sterone’s important
effects. In 2013 (Dai, et al.), a group looked for
a protein that binds t o progesterone and to the
mitochondria, but not to DNA, and found thatsuch a protein seems ubiquitous, and thatbinding progesterone causes it to hyperpolarizethe mitochondria, increasing their energyproduction, and to  prevent the decrease in sizeof the mitochondria that would otherwiseoccur with aging and loss of energyproduction.
Progesterone has been known to act protec-
tively against catabolic stress hormones, theestrogenic, inflammatory, shock and autoim-mune processes, pro-aging systems, includingthe mTOR system, but its direct structural andmetabolic actions on the mitochondria willprobably help to explain the nature of theage-accelerating effects of ionizing radiation,endotoxins and lipofuscins.
Progesterone, acting on the physical struc-
ture of the cell exactly where “pure energy”supports the living stat e and its functions, has
become a new reference point for judging the
conditions of the organism.REFERENCES

Caloric restriction (CR) decreases oxida-
tive damage, which contributes to the slowingof aging rate. It is not known if such decreasesare due to calories themselves or specificdietary components. In this work, the inges-tion of proteins of Wistar rats was decreasedby 40% below that of controls. After 7 weeks,the liver of the protein-restricted (PR) animalsshowed decreases in oxidative proteindamage, degree of membrane unsaturation,and mitochondrial complex I content. Theresults and previous inf ormation suggest that
the decrease in the rate of aging induced byPR can be due in part to decreases inmitochondrial reactive oxygen species produc-tion and DNA and protei n oxidative modifica-
tion, increases in fatty acid components moreresistant to oxidative damage, and decreasedexpression of complex I, analogously to whatoccurs during CR. Recent  studies suggest that
those benefits of PR could be caused, in turn,by the lowered methionine intake of thatdietary manipulation.

Fused, elongated mitochondria are more
efficient in generating ATP than fragmentedmitochondria. In diverse C. elegans longevitypathways, increased levels of fused mitochon-dria are associated with lifespan extension.Blocking mitochondrial fu sion in these animals
abolishes their extended longevity. The long-lived C. elegans vhl-1 m utant is an exception
that does not have increased fused mitochon-dria, and is not dependent on fusion forlongevity. Loss of mammalian VHL upregu-lates alternate energy generating pathways.This suggests that mitochondrial fusion facili-tates longevity in C. elegans by increasingenergy metabolism. In diverse animals, ATP
levels broadly decreases with age. Substantial
evidence supports the theory that increasing
or maintaining ener gy metabolism promotes
the survival of older animals. IncreasedATP levels in older animals allow energy-intensive repair and homeostatic mecha-nisms such as proteostasis that act toprevent cellular aging. These observationssupport the emerging paradigm thatmaintaining energy metabolism promotesthe survival of older animals.  Rejuvenation Res. 2009

Key points
    It is generally a ccepted that mitochon-
drial volume density in human skeletalmuscle diminishes with chronic highaltitude exposure.
    All data s upporting this concept were
collected during mountaineering expedi-tions, which are associated with theconfounding effects of whole body negativeenergy balance.
    Here we examine the effect of 28 days of
exposure to 3454 m on skeletal musclemitochondrial volume density in a settingwhere whole body weight, whole body compo-sition, leg lean mass, skeletal muscle fibre areaand maximal power output were preserved.

Ravussin. Aging is characterized by a
progressive loss of muscle mass and muscle
strength. Declines in skeletal musclemitochondria are thought to play a primaryrole in this process. Mitochondria are the
major producers of reactive oxygen species,
which damage DNA, proteins, and lipids if notrapidly quenched. Ani mal and human studies
typically show that skeletal muscle mitochon-dria are altered with aging, including increasedmutations in mitochondrial DNA, decreasedactivity of some mitochondrial enzymes,altered respiration with reduced maximal
capacity at least in sedentary individuals,  and
reduced total mitochondrial content with
increased morphological changes. However,there has been much controversy overmeasurements of mitochondrial energyproduction, which may largely be explainedby differences in approach and by whetherphysical activity is controlled for. These
changes may in turn alter mitochondrial
dynamics, such as fusion and fission rates,
and mitochondrially  induced apoptosis,
which may also lead to net muscle fiber loss
and age-related sarcopenia.  Fortunately,
strategies such as exercise and caloricrestriction that reduce oxidative damagealso improve mitochondrial function. Whilethese strategies may not completely preventthe primary effects of aging, they may help
to attenuate the rate of decline.
