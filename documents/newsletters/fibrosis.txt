Fibrosis isanoutstanding feature of
aging: Skin, joints, liver, kidneys, heart and
blood vessels, even the brain, undergo
fibrotic changes inassociation with disease,
injury, and aging.
Excitotoxins arefibrogenic
Estrogen isexcitotoxic and fibrogenic
Lactllte isfibrogenic
Edema precedes fibrosis
Injury and inflammation arefibrogenic
Free radical peroxidation isacommon
pathway leading tofibrosis, asincirrhosis of
theliver inwhich unsaturated fats and free
radicals have central roles.
Saturated fats, antihistamines, thyroid
hormone, and other antiinflammatory agents
prevent orreverse fibrosis.
The fibrous extracellular material
regulates specialized cellular functioning,
and isaprotective buffer.
Fibrogenesis commonly precedes
carcinogenesis.
Cancerization isa"field process," not
primarily aunique "genetic event."
Proteolytic enzymes continuously dissolve
and remodel theextracellular matrix.
Unsaturated fats inhibit proteolytic
enzymes.
The resistance ofthefibrin inblood clots
toenzymic dissolution isincreased by
unsaturated fats.
Antifibromatogenic hormones oppose the
development ofthe fibromas and cancers
that arecaused byestrogen.
The first principle inreversal istostop
the pathogenic process, and tostop the
stress- induced cell death. Then restorative
processes can come into balance with
degenerative.FIBROSIS: Estrogen, stiffness,
excitotoxicity, aging--a
problem more general than
"collagen disease"
Thirty years ago, myprofessors said that any
publication more than tenyears oldwasn't worth
reading; that was apparently why Inever saw the
professors inthelibrary. Inaspan oftenyears, a
change of45degrees inscientific orientation is
thought tobeprogress. But in40years, those
changes oforientation canproduce aturn of180
degrees, inwhich things that once seemed tobe
firmly established and full ofpotential have
simply been removed from theacademic canon.
The biology offibrosis isoneofthose important
things that came tobeneglected even while
massive amounts ofnew evidence were confirm-
ingtheoldviews. .
Atthe beginning ofthe 20th century, Ell
Metchnikov argued that changes intheconnective
tissues were thecause ofaging. Healso argued
that intestinal toxins were important causes ofthe
aging changes.
Eariy inthe century, x-rays were found to
produce tissue burns. The early effect ofaradia-
tion burn isinflammation and edema. The edema
gradually gives way tofibrosis, andifthe
lives long enough, thefibrotic tissue may calcIfy.
Inthe1930s, Leo Loeb found that large doses
ofestrogen stimulated massive synthesis ofcolla-
gen inthe uterus.and vagina, and noticed that
these effects resembled theincreased accumula-
tion ofcollagen that occurs with aging. Inthe
1940s, Alexander Lipshutz showed that very
small, butcontinuous, doses ofestrogen caused
fibromas todevelop inmany tissues besides the
uterus, andthat these fibromas tended todevelop
into cancers. Later, estrogen was found toacceler-
atethestiffening ofthecollagenous tissues that
normally occurs with aging.
Inthe 1930s, the Shutes, father and sons,
found that the clotting-associated diseases of
pregnancy were prevented byvitamin E,and they
proposed that vitamin Eacts asanantiestrogen,
protecting against theincreased clotting problems
caused byexcessive estrogen. They showed that
vitamin Eactivates theproteolytic, fibrinolytic,
enzymes thatremove blood clots.
Conventional beliefs identified vitamin Eas
anantioxidant that prevented oxidation ofunsatu-
rated fats, andthisfunction ofvitamin Eappeared
tomake itinconceivable that vitamin Ecould also
beofvalue inrelation tothecirculatory system.
This attitude was still dominant inthe 1970s
among dietitians, physicians, and university
professors. Besides ignoring orridiculing the
Shutes' work, mainstream journals would
occasionally publish papers denying that vitamin
Efacilitates clot removal, orthat estrogen
promotes clotting, attempting todefend their 180
degree turn.
Just after theturn ofthecentury, unsaturated
fats were found toinhibit proteolytic enzymes.
Repeatedly, thepresence ofunsaturated fatty acids
hasbeen shown toimpair clot removal, either by
itseffect onproteolytic enzymes, orbybeing
incorporated into theclot and making itresistant
todissolution.
Fibrin, thematerial that forms blood clots, is
always in the process of formation and
dissolution, inakind ofequilibrium. Athin layer
ofitcoats theoutside ofblood cells, andtheinside
ofblood vessels. When capillaries areleaky, some
ofthefibrin and itsdepolymerized subunits, leak
outintothetissues. There isacomplex interaction
between fibrin and collagen, inwhich fibrin
stimulates theformation ofcollagen (AJ Gray, et
al., 1995) and collagen stimulates the fibrin
clotting process. * Fibrin clots stimulate the
growth offibroblasts, and leaky blood vessels
(Brown, etal.,1989) can lead totissue fibrosis,
though there are routes tofibrosis that don't
involve fibrin.
Blood vessels leak under the influence of
estrogen, irradiation, oxygen deprivation, vitamin2
Edeficiency, free fatty acids, lactic acid, and
various stress mediators, such ashistamine and
serotonin; particles aslarge asredblood cells can
pass right through theendothelial cells. The loss
oftheblood vessels' ability toserve asabarrier
corresponds toadisturbance inthestructure ofthe
cells, andthisstructural permeability isapparently
theresult ofanimbalance inthestate ofthe
electrons intheproteins, theredox (reduction and
oxidation) state, regulated byglutathione and
other antioxidants andenergy regulators.
The internal state ofanycell, notjust inthe
blood vessels, isgoverned insimilar ways by
cellular energy andtheredox state ofproteins, and
intheoxidatively disturbed state, cells take up

both directions. For example, when acell is
deficient invitamin Eitloses molecules such as
ATPandproteins, that diffuse outinto theextra-
cellular spaces. When cells are inanenergy
deficient state, asinhypothyroidism, they arein
thisleaky, edematous state.
This state ofnear exhaustion issimilar tothe
"excitotoxic" state that's caused byanimbalance
between stimulation andenergy production. Inthe
brain, excitotoxins have been found toproduce a
kind offibrosis, inwhich thecells that normally
produce the myelin sheath surrounding nerve
axons begin producing collagen, and appear to
change into atype ofcell (Schwann cell) that is
notnormally found inthebrain. The production
ofcollagen seems tobeavery basic kind of
defensive reaction toexcessive stimulation or
oxygen deprivation. This makes itpossible tosee
"excitotoxicity" asageneral process, that includes
thekind offibrosis and calcification ofskin that
Hans Selye produced (bycombining vitamin E
deficiency with heavy metal toxicity and local
*In the 1920s, W.F.Koch was proposing
that oxidative free-radical processes governed the
clotting ofblood, the healing ofwounds, and
possibly thecalcification ofdevitalized tissues. At
that time, free radicals were anesoteric matter of
interest mainly toafew polymer chemists, and it
was considered absurd tosuggest that cellular
respiration could relate toextracellular fibrous
matter.
irritation), aswell asthe aging ofbrain cells
produced byprolonged estrogenic stimulation.
Scleroderma, like the other "collagen diseaes,"
affects women (during their reproductive years)
much more often than men. Retroperitoneal fibro-
sis,which can seriously damage thekidneys and
other abdominal organs, has been compared to
uterine fibroid tumors, and itiscommonly treated
successfully with the antiestrogenic drug,
tamoxifen. Tamoxifen hasalso been used totreat
keloids and toprevent abnormal scars inplastic
surgery. (Ihave seen keloids regress quickly
following theapplication ofvitamin Ewith anties-
trogenic hormones.) The fibrotic response tothe
excitotoxic imbalance can beseen inpractically
allchronic anddegenerative diseases.
Fibrosis isanabnormal progression ofthe
normal formation offibrous material between
cells, and itusually involves anincrease inthe
volume ofthe extracellular material, and an
increase inthe percentage ofcollagen inthat
matrix, and anincreased rigidity ofthecollagen
that results from chemical cross-links, that are
analogous tothepolymerization ofaplastic, orthe
vulcanizing ofrubber. Arteriosclerosis isprobably
thebest known medical example oftissue fibrosis,
butit'sthesame phenomenon that makes themeat
from anoldanimal tough andrubbery.
Although "stiffness" isafamiliar term in
engineering and biology, ithas some different
meanings indifferent situations. When atissue
swells upwith water until it'stight, itisstiffer
than initsnatural condition. The material of
tendons and ligaments gets stiffer byincreasing its
density and toughness. When abone gets old, it
gets brittle and weak, and inone sense itisstiffer
than achild's bone, since achild's bone can be
deformed without breaking: While theengineering
definitions can't beapplied toalltissues ina
simple way, biologically it'suseful tothink of
stiffness assomething that progresses along with
fibrosis, asthefunction ofatissue decreases. In
thefirst stage oftissue injury, swelling stiffens a
tissue; after prolonged edema, there may bean
increased volume and concentration ofcollagen
around cells; finally, the density ofthecollagen
can increase, and can calcifiy, asinthesclera of3
the eye, the arteries, heart valves, pericardium,
and even theheart muscle itself.
Indiseases ofstress and aging, there isa
general inflammatory state, that can end inmulti-
ple organ failure. Congestive heart failure illus-
trates some ofthe effects ofthis energy-poor,
inflamed and edematous state: The heart's
function isreduced because ofstiffness caused by
increased water and calcium inthe cells; atthe
same time, arteries arestiff and resistant, impair-
ing the flow ofblood and making regulation of
blood pressure difficult. Inchronic hypothyroid-
ism, theheart gradually becomes fibrotic, and this
provides anopportunity forcalcification tooccur.
Ifacallus isametaphor for the normal,
protective function ofconnective tissue, then a
com isametaphor fortheharmful overdevelop-
ment ofthe protective reaction. The ordinary
minor mechanical tensions and pressures that
occur inany living animal, aswell asthe
biochemical gradients produced bymetabolizing
cells, shape theconnective tissues that keep cells
intheir particular place inthe organism. When
gelatin, made byboiling connective tissues in
water, isinjected into agrowing organism, the
randomly arranged molecules ofthemelted colla-
gen can beseen toorganize themselves back into
the coherently aligned cable-like structures of
normal connective tissue.
Cells decide what they will beand doaccord-
ingtotheir surroundings. Normally, cells live in
contact with alayer ofnon-cellular material
containing fibrous and elastic and gelatinous
material, that functions asamedium ofcommuni-
cation with other cells. Irritation, stress, and shock
commonly produce aseries oftissue reactions,
including edema, fibrosis, calcification, anddeath,
but with certain possible alternatives, such asa
return tothenormal state, orearly cell death, or
lipodystrophy (fatty degeneration), ortumefaction
(development into atumor).
Although there are specialized cells, fibro-
blasts, that form large amounts ofconnective
tissue, they are very closely related tomuscle
cells, fatcells, and glial cells, andthefunctions of
one can sometimes change into those ofanother
type. One ofthemain problems ofbiology inthe
lastcentury hasbeen tounderstand thefactors that
cause onekind ofcelltochange into another. One
ofthe functions ofthe collagen layer secreted
around cells appears tobetoprovide adegree of
insulation from thenumerous "inductive" factors,
sothatacellcanremain what itis.
Conditions inthewhole organism affect the
wayan individual cell will relate toitsimmediate
environment. Nutritional deficiencies orimbal-
ances will make special demands oncertain types
oftissue. Increased collagen production can
provide some protection against toxins, butthe
protective layer also limits thecells' access tothe
blood supply.
Cells intheir excited and exhausted state are
increasingly open topenetfatiOl'. ofthe toxins,
because oftheir own increased permeability, and
because oftheincreased leakiness oftheblood
vessels. Certain environmental toxins accumulate
more rapidly asthe cells lose their ability to
destroy them. Several kinds oftoxin, including the
unsaturated fats, inhibit theproteolytic enzymes
that remodel tissue, and reduce the ability to
dismantle andrebuild theextracellular matrix.
Collagen isavery unusual protein, since it
lacks tryptophan andcysteine, andcontains avery
high percentage ofglycine. Glycine isthesimplest
amino acid, and serves as an inhibitory
transmitter. Ithas some remarkable protective
activities against toxins, buteven theprocess of
forming ithas some uniquely protective conse-
quences: Itismade from sugar, with theaddition
ofammonia removed from glutamic acid, leaving
ketoglutaric acid astheproduct; ketoglutarate isa
component ofthe Krebs cycle. Ineffect, the
formation ofglycine helps toeliminate anexcito-
toxin while replenishing thepathway ofoxidative
metabolism. When collagen isdissolved, alarge
amount oftheantitoxic glycine isreleased, butnot
abitoftheexcitotoxic antithyroid amino acids
cysteine andtryptophan.
The increased energy deficiency produced by
accumulated toxins and fibrosis canstimulate the
production ofporphyrins fortheheme enzymes
thatcontrol respiration anddetoxification, andthis
can lead totheproduction ofcarbon monoxide
and other anti-respiratory factors. Increasing
amounts ofammonia and lactic acid circulate4
through thetissues. As excitatory states replace
the capacity for resting inhibition, increased
amounts ofmany hormones and other signal
substances circulate, and many ofthem are
produced inunusual sites, often inthe same
tissues that respond tothem, aswhen abreast
cancer produces estrogen. Inthe absence of
communication between the tissue and its
environment, these locally produced factors
probably serve tomaintain local homeostasis, but
atthe expense ofthe functions ofthe whole
organism.
Inevery different part ofthebody, theextra-
cellular matrix reflects theindividuality ofitscell
types and their particular function. But asthe
body's (:,xposure to imbalances progresses,
the general properties ofdeterioration start to
become more important than the specialized
functions.
Toreverse thisprocess, it'snecessary toavoid
doiI!g the things that caused the problem to
develop. The accumulation ofheavy metals and
of the unstable unsaturated fats (linoleic,
linolenic, andarachidonic acids) canbeslowed or
reversed bycareful dietary choices. The calorie-
restricted diets that slow theaging process reduce
the accumulation ofthe unstable fats and the
heavy metals. Vitamin Ereduces the vascular
leakiness andthefree radical peroxidation thatare
soclosely involved infibrosis. Since serotonin
