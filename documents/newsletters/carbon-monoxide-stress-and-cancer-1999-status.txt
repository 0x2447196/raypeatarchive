Carbon Monoxide, Stress, and
Cancer: 1999 statusTHE ARGUMENT:
Cancer isthe result ofordinary physiological
processes which become autonomous because of
regulatory weaknesses intheorganism.
Respiration isessential forthemaintenance ofthe
higher forms oflife, and itisarespiratory defect, on
both the cellular and the organismic levels, which
allows cancer topersist and develop.
The heme group, because itserves many respira-
tory functions--hemoglobin, mitochondrial respiratory
enzymes, steroid synthesizing enzymes, formation of
thyroid hormone, detoxifying enzymes--is regulated in
relatively primitive ways within each cell, and inmore
complex ways athigher organismic levels.
When the cell needs more respiratory energy,
some fuel isdiverted theproduction ofporphyrin
which isthen turned i which would normall
provide for the effici production ofenergy and
protective factors.
When theefficient energy-producinl: systems are
byinjury, oxygen deficiency, toxins, orbythe
lack ofoneormore nutritional heme
rOduction isactivated. W
heme isdestroyed bythe enzyme e
xcnas which converts heme into biliver' d

cells can account forcancer's self-sustaining, "heredi-
tary," property, without invoking genetic mutations
which arenow known tobeconsequences, rather than
causes ofcancer.
The production ofcarbon monoxide and biliv-
erdin can account for many ofthe structural and
biochemical abnormalities ofcancer cells, and for
their induction ofabnormalities inadjacent cells.
"Genetic" theories ofcancer have now reached a
dead end, and the epigenetic, developmental-
physiological approach remains astheonly plausible
description ofcancer.When wethoroughly understand cancer, we
willbecloser tounderstanding lifeitself.
Cancer, AIDS, and extreme hypothyroidism
have several fe_atures incommon--they cause
tiSsue (ossJand }organ damage:) with immunodefi-
ciency and intense activation ofthe stress
hormones, including cortisol. Incancer and
AIDS, agood case hasbeen made fortheprimacy
ofstress-induced wasting asthemain cause of
death. Whatever one might believe tobethe
cause ofcancer and AIDS, itisalways good for
the patient toprevent tissue damage from the
stress associated with thesickness. Since the
stress hormones primarily destroy tissues
IvaIOnofseCIICroteases, theuseof
einhibitors for treating AIDS isprobably
helpmg toprevent tissue loss, asanunintended
side effect. But inthecase ofcancer, there are
good reasons for believing that metabolic
dysregulations arethecause ofthedisease itself,
aswell asofthewasting symptoms.
When Iwrote about carbon monoxide asa
cancer hormone afew years ago, some people
were confused, and Ithink that was because I
didn't explain indetail how Otto Warburg's work
made theidea semsoobvious.
Instudying epigments ofcellular respiration
(enzyme cofactors, includmg vitamin B2and the
cytochromes), Otto Warburg (1926) found that
carbon monoxide, therespiratory poison, bound to
some ofthecrucial pigments, andthat light would
free the pigment from the carbon monoxide,
restoring respiration. Despite the fact that his
work isdescribed inallbiochemistry textbooks,
until very recently thetoxicity ofcarbon monox-

Most people inthe contemporary medical
industry aresofond oftheidea ofDNA-mutation,
followed by"clonal selection," toexplain cancer,
that they areable toignore themany types of·--'rthat, during hislifetime, itwasn't recognized as
something which isproduced inthe body.
Warburg had noreason tosuspect that carbon
monoxide would beproduced bythe cell
exactly when the cell's respiratory apparatus
was challenged. But since about 1971, carbon
monoxide has been recognized asanormal
product ofthedegradation ofheme, approxi-
mately atthe same time that ithas become
clear that respiratory distress onthe cellular
level stimulates both the synthesis and the
degradation ofheme.
Unfortunately, after Warburg's death, there
were noprestigious advocates ofhistheory, and
his death coincided with America's "war on
cancer," which consisted ofgiving huge public
funding tothe"cancer genetics" estrablishment,
people who were congenitally hostile tothe
concept that cancer hadknowable orcontrollable
causes. Industry and medicine found itconven-
ienttoargue thatpeople were responsible fortheir
own diseases, inthe sense that they inherited
them, asakind ofmechanistic karma. Mutations
inthe inherited genes were, by definition,
"random, "which gave them the virtue ofbeing
impossible topin down toaspecific, legally
actionable, cause.
The genetic, and thus "essential," nature of
cancer justified theconcept oftreating itbykilling
it.(The procedure William Blake described 200
years ago as"curing thepox bycutting outthe
spots.") The doctrine ofgenetic causality
indicated that only capital punishment could deal
with thetraitor-genes. Although these essential-
istsatfirst hadrejected theidea thatviruses could
integrate themselves within our genes, after
several years they realized that this idea meant
that the infectious disease establishment could
join forces with the enetics establishment. The
new, higWy funded' ncogene" establishment had
absolute control over cancer research, and that
direct control spread indirectly, likeamalignancy,
throughout academic andcommercial biology.t<-.'<...>I/ -01/,",'" F+f..yU Y-l'- I-<.<C) V"'''> /Y}{J/(Vn,;A

(I.e,
effects onhemoglobin, preventing thedelivery of
oxygen tocells, rather than toitseffects onthe
respiratory pigments inthe mitochondria, as
demonstrated byWarburg. Ofthethousands of
publications onthetoxicity ofcarbon monoxide in
recent decades, its effects on mitochondrial
metabolism have hardly been investigated,
because ofthepersepective that itwas apoison
coming from outside thebody, and that itseffect
onhemoglobin was sufficient tocause death, so
thequestion ofitseffect onthemitochondrion
wasmedically irrelevant.
Inhis famous theory ofcancer, Warburg
argued thatcancer was always characterized by"a
respiratory defect," and heargued that many
things could damage therespiratory system and
lead tocancer. Heandhiscolleagues over several
decades showed that allthe known causes of
cancer produced the characteristic respiratory
defect ofcancer, inwhich cells would produce
inthepresence ofnrmal levels of
oxygen. T.his iscalled erobic glycolysis din
normal cells, the production 0 achc acid is
anaerobic, since the .availability of
suppresses the production oflactic acid, and
causes carbon dioxide tobeprod instead.
(This effect ofoxygen iscalled thePasteur effect,
andIthink itislargely theproduction ofcaron
dioxide which accounts forit,though other things
such asthelevel ofATPcontribute toit.)
Warburg showed that chemical carcinogens,
radiation, prolonged culture without adequate
oxygen, and even vitamin rnIorBi}deficiency
would promote first the characteristic cancer
metabolism, andthen actual cancerization. Most
cells with therespiratory defect simply died, andit
was those which could adapt tolive with the
defect which became cancerous. The tumor which
results from ametabolic defect will "eplgeneti-
cally," secon-darrIy, develop chromosome imbal-
ances, which may approximately coincide with the
cells' transformation into cancer, and thecondi-
tions within thetumor will increase thetendency
toproduce mutations, which arenotlikely tobe
repaired inthe extremely stressed state ofthe
cells.
Ithink thereason Warburg didn't explore the
role ofcarbon monoxide incancer was simply
evidence that show cancer tobeaprocess of
deterioration inamass ofcells, rather than a
progression ofasingle cellthrough stages ofDNA
mutation.
This obsessive belief that"DNA causes every-
thing" goes back toWeismannism, and the
Neo-Darwinism that hefounded bypresenting
his--purely arbitrary--arguments toeliminate the
inheritance ofacquired traits from thetheory of
evolution, and--opposing Darwin--to claim that
Natural Selection was theonly force inevolution.
Weismannism, initsabsolute rejection ofthe
environmental adaptationism ofDarwin and
Lamarck, was almost areversion toPreformation-
sim. Initsinsistence onthe"isolation ofthe
germline," orthe immortality ofthe germ line
which was passed oninthegerm cells ofthe
gonads, Weismannism subscribed tothePrefor-
mationist belief that allfuture generations are
contained inthegerm cell, anditsadherents tried
tojustify this byasserting that thesoma, allthe
rest oftheindividual outside ofthegerm celis,
was nothing more than amortal shadow ofthe
essential (genetic) immortal being, since thebody
was produced precisely bythedeletion ofthe
information contained inthegerm cell. (This
doctrine was behind thedenial that animals could
becloned from thenucleus ofbody cells. Even
after frogs, sheep, andcows were produced inthis
way, there were some people who couldn't accept
theresults asfacts. The doctrine that "telomeric
shortening" causes aging came straight out of
Weismannism.)
Ofcourse those ideas were false, nothing but
anabsurd application ofRationalist philosophy to
biology toeliminate Darwin's "materialism," but
thedoctrine's importance isundeniable, since its
direct influence can beseen inevery university
biology course andtextbook ofthe20th century.
Itisthisessentialist commitment ofthecancer
establishment that has made Warburg's work
practically disappear from theacademic culture.
-His demonstration that the cancer metabolism
-could bereversed byvitamins was athreat tothe
entire foundation oftwentieth century essentialist
medicine.
POOL toJJfrlf:o ....+=..,. PCrl..('!,'1tC,;;Because ofmyinterest intheeffects oflight
onthehormones and respiratory energy produc-
tion, andmylong-standing interest inWarburg's
view ofoxygen's roleinevolution andcancer, and
myawareness thatporphyrins *were atone time
thought tobecancer hormones, itseemed obvious
tothink ofcarbon monoxide asacancer hormone.
Ihappened tobecome acquainted with Leonell
Strong, who developed thestrains ofcancer-prone
mice that have been used inbreast cancer
research. Although hewas ageneticist and bred
the mice that demonstrated the inheritance of
cancer, healso showed that simple therapeutic
measures would not only prevent cancer ina
susceptible individual, but would also prevent
cancer inmany generations ofthe treated
animal's descendants. Strong discovered that
andpoor nutrition lead tooverproduction
oftheporphyrin pigment, and contribute tothe
development ofcancer. Heshowed that theliver
was involved inthe control ofcancer. The
Shutes, the Biskinds, and Alexander Lipshutz
were atthistime revealing other effects ofestro-
genthatilluminated Strong's discoveries.
Besides Strong, who showed individual and
hereditary avoidance ofcancer, many other
workers have demonstrated that "established"
cancer cell lines can beinduced torevert to
normal tissue. Inheritance isn't indelibly fixed. A
physiological state ispassed on. Since carbon
monoxide produces arespiratory defect, and is
produced during respiratory deficiency, itisone
ofthefactors which canaccount forthe"heritabil-
ity"ofcancer. When cancer cells areimplanted
into ahealthy host, they seldom gorw, butwhen
implanted into a:host who already hascancer, they
grow. (Hakim, 1988.) The healthy host provides
many restorative factors,tlie sick host provides
additional harmful factors, but few restorative
factors (Chekulaev, etaI., 1987.)
(*Porphyrins are the pigment molecules that
include theheme ofhemoglobin, ofthe respira-
tory cytochromes, the peroxidases including
thyroid peroxidase, and ofthe P450 enzymes
which, among other things, produce steroid
hormones.)

/", Vv)/ M InWarburg's view, cancer has aunique
'J...pi Arequirement forglucose, because ofits"respira-
tory defect." The ability ofcancer toconsume
large amounts ofglucose means that thebody
interprets cancer asstress, since the waste of
glucose isthekey feature ofstress. The body's
response todecreasing glucose istoproduce larger
amounts ofadrenal hormones, especially cortisol.
Cortisol raises the blood glucose supply by
converting tissue proteins into sugar. This hormo-
nalresponse tothesugar appetite ofcancer isthe
main cause ofthewasting syndrome which makes
cancer soserious, and which destroys thethymus
gland, causing the immune system tolose its
guidance. V.S.Shapot's work, showing the
involvment ofglucose and cortisol incancer,
provides part ofthecontext forunderstanding the
implications ofWarburg's view ofcancer asa
"respiratory defect."
Alcohol has theability tolower blood glucose,
but itdoes itpartly bysuppressing the stress-
induced secretion ofcortisol, reducing theconver-
sion ofthebody's proteins into glucose, and shift-
'ngmetabolism toward fat asanenergy source.
Additionally, ethyl alcohol happens todetoxify
carbon monoxide, "desorbing" itfrom the heme
groups, somewhat aslight does. These properties
ofalcohol have been studied inhospitalized
patients. Interminal cancer patients, itwas found
tobeextremely effective inprotecting against the
tissue wasting process. Even inalcoholics with
liver cirrhosis, itwas found tobeprotective tothe
liver, when added toagood diet.
Ordinary stress lowers blood sugar and
produces lactic acid, because ituses energy faster
than cells canproduce itbyway ofefficient oxida-
tive metabolism, and sosugar isinefficientlyconverted tolactic acid. This form ofmetabolism
raises thecell's internal pH,intensifies itsnegative
electrical charge, and causes ittotake upwater,
and toalter itscontrol ofsalts andother solutes;
these changes may stimulate cell division, bu
they canalso cause celldeath, oradaptive modifi-
cations.
While the genetic, the metabolic, and the
adaptive processes seem tobeonvery different
"levels," ifwearetothink about them inrealistic
and productive ways, it'snecessary tofollow the
ways inwhich they areintegrated, andtoseegene
regulation and metabolic responses to the
environment asacontinuous physical-chemical
process. The myth ofthe isolated immortal
germline, anditsderivative, the"Central Dogma"
ofmolecular genetics, that sees information
flowing only from the genes into theproteins,
have kept most researchers from looking
elsewhere forregulatory principles.
The idea ofinheritance asarigidly fixed
system hasmade iteasy tothink ofbiology in
terms ofthe"lock and key" analogy, inwhich an
enzyme and itssubstrate, anantibody and its
antigen, anorganism and itsniche, agene and its
inducer, etc., have aspecific, fixed, mechanical
relationship. However, even thesimplest organ-
isms have qualities that can seem more like a
locksmith who with alittle time can figure out
how toopen locks without akey. Allbiological
systems are simultaneously regulated onmore
than onelevel, inacoherent andunified way.
The cell's framework, the"cytoskeleton," was
demonstrated early inthe70th century, but the
dogmatic view ofthecellas"liquid enclosed bya
membrane" caused ittobeignored bymost biolo-
gists until the1970s. The cytoskeleton isstrongly
influenced by respiratory distress and the
hormones that are soclosely associated with
oxidative processes, estrogen and theporphyrin
derivatives inparticular.
The cytoskeleton includes avariety of
filaments and tubelike structures. The microtu-
buIes make uptheapparatus that separates the
chromosomes during cell division. Estrogen can
cause almost instantaneous changes inthe
cytoskeleton proteins and their interations with•
have avariety ofactions that tend toimprove
respiration.
Things that protect thebowel, such asraw
carrots, have far-reaching effects onhormones and
immunity. Eggs contain many protective and
therapeutic factors, inspite oftheir excess oftoxic
unsaturated fatsresulting from anunnatural diet;
egg lecithin, forexample, isn't immunosuppres-
sive, assoybean lecithin is.
The last experiments ofLeonell Strong, In
which hefound that certain combinations of
nucleosides could cause the disappearance of
cancer from theprogeny ofthetreated animals,
should betaken seriously. They relate tothe
heritable effects ofhormone balance ("hormonal
imprinting"), andsohave implications farbeyond
theprevention ofcancer.

10;95(23): 13692-7 Genetic instability ofcancer cells is
proportional totheir degree ofaneuploidy. Duesberg P,
Rausch C,Rasnick D,Hehlmann R\II Genetic andpheno-
typic instability arehallmarks ofcancer cells, buttheir cause
isnotclear. The leading hypothesis suggests that apoorly
defined gene mutation generates genetic instability andthat
some ofmany subsequent mutations then cause cancer. Here
weinvestigate thehypothesis that genetic instability of
cancer cells iscaused byaneuploidy, anabnormal balance
ofchromosomes. Because symmetrical segregation of
chromosomes depends onexactly two copies ofmitosis
genes, aneuploidy involving chromosomes with mitosis
genes willdestabilize thekaryotype. Thehypothesis predicts
that thedegree ofgenetic instability should beproportional
tothedegree ofaneuploidy. Thus itshould bedifficult, if
notimpossible, tomaintain theparticular karyotype ofa
highly aneuploid cancer cell onclonal propagation. This
prediction wasconfirmed with clonal cultures ofchemically
transformed, aneuploid Chinese hamster embryo cells. It
was found that thehigher theploidy factor ofaclone, the
more unstable was itskaryotype. The ploidy factor isthe
quotient ofthemodal chromosome number divided bythe
normal number ofthespecies. Transformed Chinese hamster
embryo cells with aploidy factor of1.7were estimated to
change their karyotype atarateofabout 3%pergeneration,
compared with 1.8% forcells with aploidy factor of0.95.
Because thebackground noise ofkaryotyping isrelatively
high, thecells with lowploidy factor may bemore stable
than our method suggests. The karyotype instability of
human colon cancer cell lines, recently analyzed by
Lengnauer etal.[Lengnauer, c., Kinzler, K.W.&Vogel-
stein, B.(1997) Nature (London) 386, 623-627], also corre-
sponds exactly totheir degree ofaneuploidy. Weconclude
that aneuploidy issufficient toexplain genetic instability
andtheresulting karyotypic andphenotypic heterogeneity of
cancer cells, independent ofgene mutation. Because
aneuploidy hasalso been proposed tocause cancer, our
hypothesis offers acommon, unique mechanism ofaltering
water. Under theinfluence ofestrogen, microtu-
buies, forexample, change their physical state and
appear todissolve. Experiments show that
increasing amounts ofestrogen cause progr§-
sively more severe disruptions ofthe mitotic
apparatys, producing lopsided cell diyjsions.
lWhen these abnormal "mitotic figures" arefound
inbreast tissue, itmeans thatcells arebeing killed
byanexcess ofestrogen, butthese dying cells are
usually taken as"evidence ofcancer. ")
Biliverdin, produced along with carbon
monoxide inthe breakdown ofheme, causes
changes inother parts ofthecytoskeleton, includ-
ing theproteins inthe nucleus which help to
regulate themovements ofnucleic acids.
Carbon monoxide, and other substances such
asnitric oxide which also function asrespiratory
Roisons, suppress energy production by the
mitochondria, and this activates enzymes which
cut DNA molecules, producing either DNA
rearrangement, orapoptotic celldeath.
All ofthese well established observations
show thesteps bywhich physiological reactions
can lead to chromosomal and genetic
abnormalities.
The steps toward cancer include chronic lrntation,
recognized forcenturies asacause ofcancer; aninflamma-
tory reaction activates enzymes that release estrogen.
(Histamine, free fatty acids, prostaglandins, calcium and
other products ofinflammation are further promoted by
estrogen, andsynergize with it.)
Estrogen activates other inflammatory "acute phase"
andstress-shock proteins, including heme oxygenase, which
produces carbon monoxide andbiliverdin. These arepower-
fulprotective and antioxidant factors making cells resistant
Xtoapoptosis andregulation.
Biliverdin (F. Paradisi, 1975) activates beta-
glucuronidase, one ofthemain enzymes involved inthe
local release ofestrogen.
Inlater stages, anemia and hemolysis areassociated
with COandbiliverdin production from therelease ofheme.
(Anemia isseen inmost patients with advanced cancer.)
Biliverdin, combined with estrogen and hypoxia, alters the
cytoskeleton, producing chromosome imbalances, causing
mutations andactivating the"oncogenes."
The respiratory defect ofcancer interferes with the
production ofcarbon dioxide. C02 suppresses lactic acid
formation, and isessential forallnormal cell processes; it
appears tobeanimportant factor inproducing cellular
differentiation (Dictyostelium).Estrogen promotes lactic acid formation, andpromotes
porphyrin synthesis, providing the material for forming
heme and carbon monoxide. Besides causing porphyria,
estrogen causes many other liver diseases, including
chole"stasis, the failure torelease bile; the inhibition of
carbon monoxide formation hasbeen found topromote bile
flow. Estrogen promotes theformation oftheenzyme heme
oxygenase, which forms carbon monoxide from heme.
Carbon monoxide increases theformation ofcortisol,
bystimulating ACTH release from thepituitary.
The stress response isself-sustaining onseveral levels.
For example, stress increases theabsorption ofbacterial
endotoxin from theintestine, which increases theestrogen
level andsynergizes with biliverdin andcortisol.
While estrogen does cause direct DNA damage, its
clearest effect incarcinogenesis isonthecytoskeleton which
regulates cell division, and defective cell division, rather
than "gene mutation," isoneoftheimportant steps inthe
progression ofcancer (Rubin, Duesberg).
Cancer cells areprotected against thebody's ability to
destroy them, bytheantioxidant functions ofcarbon dioxide
andbiliverdin ..
The multilevel physiological nature ofcancer
calls foramultilevel physiological approach toits
prevention andcure.
This would include antiestrogen regimes,
antiinflammatory andantihistamine factors (hista-
mine interacts closely with nitric oxide andcarbon
monoxide), adequate nutrition, carbon dioxide,
andspecific anti-carbon monoxide therapies (such
aslight, alcohol, andpossibly theminerals which
convert porphyrin into compounds that inhibit the
production ofcarbon monoxide), and methods to
decrease nitric oxide formation and torestrain
cortisol production, since these promote the
formation ofcarbon monoxide. One ofthemost
interesting approaches toinhibiting carbon
monoxide production istousevitamin B12, as
hydroxocobalamin, asanantidote tonitric
oxide, preventing thenitric oxide from stimu-
lating the formation ofheme oxygenase.
Wherever carbon monoxide mediates abiological
malfunction, asinaquired immunodeficiency,
Alzheimer's disease, and cancer, vitamin BI2
seems tohave aplace asadetoxicant.
Progesterone and thyroid have several desir-
able properties thatmake them generally useful in
cancer prevention andtherapy. The shorter-chain
saturated fatty acids contained incoconut oilhave
several beneficial effects. Aspirin andvitamin E

Hehlmann RAneuploidy orchromosome imbalance isthe
most massive genetic abnormality ofcancer cells. Itused to
beconsidered thecause ofcancer when itwas discovered
more than 100years ago. Since thediscovery ofthegene,
theaneuploidy hypothesis haslostground tothehypothesis
thatmutation ofcellular genes causes cancer. According to
thishypothesis, cancers arediploid andaneuploidy issecon-
dary ornonessential. Here wereexamine theaneuploidy
hypothesis inview ofthefactthatnearly allsolid cancers are
aneuploid, that many carcinogens arenongenotoxic, and
that mutated genes from cancer cells donot transform
diploid human oranimal cells. Byregrouping thegene
pool-as inspeciation-aneuploidy inevitably will alter many
genetic programs. This genetic revolution canexplain the
numerous unique properties ofcancer cells, such as
invasiveness, dedifferentiation, distinct morphology, and
specific surface antigens, much better than gene mutation,
which islimited bytheconservation oftheexisting chromo-
some structure. Todetermine whether aneuploidy isacause
oraconsequence oftransformation, wehave analyzed the
chromosomes ofChinese hamster embryo (CHE) cells trans-
formed invitro. This system allows (i)detection oftransfor-
mation within 2months andthus about 5months sooner than
carcinogenesis and (ii)thegeneration ofmany more trans-
formants percost than carcinogenesis. Tominimize mutation
ofcellular genes, wehave used nongenotoxic carcinogens. It
was found that 44outof44colonies ofCHE cells trans-
formed bybenz[a)pyrene, methylcholanthrene, dimeth-
ylbenzanthracene, and colcemid, orspontaneously were
between 50and 100% aneuploid. Thus, aneuploidy origi-
nated with transformation. Two oftwo chemically trans-
formed colonies tested were tumorigenic 2months after
inoculation into hamsters. The cells oftransformed colonies
were heterogeneous inchromosome number, consistent with
thehypothesis that aneuploidy can perpetually destabilize
thechromosome number because itunbalances theelements
ofthemitotic apparatus. Considering thatall44transformed
colonies analyzed were aneuploid, andtheearly association
between aneuploidy, transformation, andtumorigenicity, we
conclude that aneuploidy isthecause rather than aconse-
quence oftransformation.

Dominant transformation bymutated human rasgenes
invitro requires more than 100 times higher expression
than isobserved incancers. Hua VY, Wang WK.,
Duesberg PH The gene-mutation-cancer hypothesis holds
thatmutated cellular protooncogenes, such aspoint-mutated
proto-ras, "playa dominant part incancer," because they are
sufficient totransform transfected mouse cell lines invitro
[Alberts, B.,Bray, D.,Lewis, 1.,Raff, M.,Roberts, K.&Watson, 1.D.(1994) Molecular Biology ofthe Cell
(Garland, New York)]. However, incells transformed in
vitro mutated human rasgenes areexpressed more than
100-f91d than inthecancers from which they areisolated. In
view ofthediscrepancy between thevery low levels of
rastranscription incancers and thevery high levels in
cells transformed invitro, we have investigated the
minimal level ofhuman rasexpression fortransformation in
vitro. Using point-mutated human rasgenes recombined
with different promoters from either human
metallothionein-IIA orhuman fibronectin orfrom retrovi-
ruses we found dominant invitro transformation ofthe
mouse C3H cell line only with rasgenes linked toviral
promoters. These rasgenes were expressed more than
120-fold higher than arenative rasgenes ofC3H cells. The
copy number oftrans feetedrasgenes ranged from 2-6inour
system. Inaddition, nondominant transformation was
observed inasmall percentage (2-7%) ofC3H cells trans-
feetedwith rasgenes thatareexpressed lessthan 20times
higher than native C3H rasgenes. Because over 90% of
cells expressing rasatthismoderately enhanced level were
untransformed, transformation must follow either a
nondominant rasmechanism oranon-ras mechanism.
Weconclude that themutated, butnormally expressed, ras
genes found inhuman andanimal cancers arenotlikely to

AL, Arnstein P,Rubin H.NIH 3T3 cells undergo morpho-
logical transformation inresponse toconditions of
constrained growth, such asoccur inlowserum concentra-
tions oratconfluence. Transformation isexpressed ina

cells. Weisolated andexpanded cellpopulations from three
dense andthree light foci. Cells from each ofthese popula-
tions efficiently reproduced foci ofthesame morphotype
when grown onabackground ofnontransformed NIH 3T3
cells. Using cultures derived from oneofthedense foci
(subline D/2), wefound that thenumber offocus-forming
units was stable and thecells remained tumorigenic when
they were subjected torepeated thrice-weekly passage in2%
calfserum. However, equivalent passage in10% calfserum

eventually rendered the cells incapable ofboth focus
production andtumor formation. The results show that the
capacity toproduce tumors aswell asmorphological
transformation areproduced asaresponse tophysiologi-
cal constraints ofgrowth and/or metabolism inthe
absence ofcarcinogens and that both properties can be
reversed bylifting the constraints. This behavior is
typical ofanadaptational response and, taken together
with other supporting evidence, shows that tumorigene-
sisdoes not require conventional genetic alteration.

Tumour-bearing mice, 248 innumber, have been injected
with 5-methyl-cytidine dissolved inphysiological salt
solution. The mice were divided into 5series depending
upon theamount of5-methyl-cytidine they received. Mice of
asuccessive series received 43.2, 28.8, 14.4 and 7.2mglkg
body weight. There was aprogressive increase inthe
percentage ofmice showing regression oftumours inthe
successive series, asfollows: 45%, 50%, 65%, 60%, and
67.8% respectively, giving anaverage percentage ofregres-
sions of59.7%. The incidence ofmice developing multiple
primary tumours increased inthesame successive series
respectively asfollows: 25%, 43.8%, 58.3%, 73.3%, and
70%, thus giving anaverage of58.3%. The evidence
obtained indicates aninverse correlation (dose-response)
between theamount ofthe5-methyl-cytidine injected and
thepercentage ofregressions ofspontaneous tumours.

6-methyl adenosine, and 5-methyl cytidine -also dissolved
inphysiological saltsolution. The mice were divided into 6groups based upon thenumber ofgenerations ofdescent
from amouse injected with analcohol-soluble liver extract.
The criterion oftumor growth istheaverage increment of

LC, Matsunaga HTen series mice ofC3H/ST inbreds with

Inseries 1-5the5-methyl cytidine was dissolved indistilled
water, and inseries 6-10, thenucleoside was dissolved in
physiological saltsolution. Indoses administered, series 4-5
overlapped with series 6-7. The number ofmice thatshowed
aregression oftumor increased inthesuccessive series
(48%-63% inseries 1-5and 25%-73% inseries 6-10). As
thenumber ofmice with regressing tumors increased, the
percentage ofmice showing multiple primary tumors also
increased. The administration ofthenucleoside inphysio-
logical saltsolution altered theinhibitory effect of5-methyl
cytidine onspontaneous tumors. Forexample, inphysiologi-
calsaltsolution the0.5Img/injection gave asmuch inhibi-
tory action as1.03 mg/injection indistilled water. An
inverse dose response isthus indicated between theamount
of5-methyl cytidine injected andtheinhibition ofspontane-

transmissible entities appear tobepresent and they show
different degrees ofeffect upon thegrowth andregression of
spontaneous tumours ofmammary gland origin (adenocarci-
noma). The first transmissible entity (TE) occurred inthe
lineal descent ofmice following injection ofthe liver

tionof5-methyl cytidine. TEmanifested itsmaximum effect
insuppressing cancer inmice during the20th generation of
alineal descent following theinjection oftheoriginal liver

beoptimal incontrolling cancer intheFIIgeneration ofa
second lineal descent derived from anoriginal cancer

Allmice studied were lineal descendents ofatumor-bearing

descent there appears tobeatransmissible entity presumably
induced bytheinjection oftheliver extract. Following 15
generations ofinbreeding after theappearance ofatransmis-

growth inmice hasbeen indicated. This change hasprogres-
sively altered thegrowth ofcancer from avery loweffect to
amaximal effect, i.e., toacomplete regression ofahigh

Endogenous carbon monoxide suppression stimulates
bile acid-dependent biliary transport inperfused rat
liver. Sano T,Shiomi M,Wakabayashi Y,Shinoda Y,Goda
N,Yamaguchi T,Nimura Y,Ishimura Y,Suematsu MThis
study aimed toinvestigate whether carbon monoxide (CO),
aproduct ofheme oxygenase that degrades protoheme IX,
serves asanendogenous modulator forbiliary transport. To
that end, effects ofzinc protoporphyrin IX(ZnPP), aheme
oxygenase inhibitor, onthebiliary transport were tested in
perfused ratliver. Perfusion ofImicroM ZnPP abolished
detectable levels ofCO inthe venous perfusate and
increased bile acid-dependent bile output accompanying an
increased secretion ofbilesalts. The ZnPP-induced cholere-
sis coincided with areduction oftissue guanosine
3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) levels andadecrease in
vascular conductance. Onadministration of2.5 microM CO,
ZnPP-elicited choleresis, decreases invascular conductance,
and cGMP levels were allattenuated. Treatment with I
microM 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic mono phosphate
(8-BrcGMP) partly attenuated theZnPP-induced cholere-
sisinconcert with repression ofvascular conductance.
Furthermore, treatment oftheliver with methylene blue, a
guanylate cyclase inhibitor, evoked acholeresis similar to
that induced byZnPP. Thus endogenous CO suppression
stimulates the biliary transport inpart through a
cGMP-dependent mechanism.

Urology 1996 May;47(5):727-33 Expression ofheme
oxygenase-l (HSP32) inhuman prostate: normal, hyper-
plastic, and tumor tissue distribution. Maines MD,
Abrahamsson PA OBJECTIVES. Heme oxygenase
isozymes, HO-I and HO-2, aremembers ofthestresslheat
shock (HSP) family ofproteins, with theknown function of
cleaving theheme molecule tobiliverdin, iron, and carbon
monOXide. The aimofthisstudy wastoexamine thepattern
oftissue expression ofHO-I inthehuman prostate under
different states ofproliferation and differentiation and to
investigate whether thepattern differs between these states.
METHODS. Presently, wehave determined thepattern of
tissue expression ofthe stress-inducible isozyme, HO-I
(HSP32), inhuman prostate under normal and pathologic
conditions, by immunohistochemistry, using polyclonal
antibodies, and have measured HO-I and HO-2 mRNA
levels innormal prostate and benign prostatic
(BPH) byNorthern blotting. The activity ofprostate to
q
catalyze heme degradation was also assessed. RESULTS. In
normal and BPH tissue, columnar epithelial cells ofacini
and ducts and cells instroma displayed HO-I immunoreac-
tivity; inallcells, perinuclear staining was prominent. In
BPH tissue, however, amore intense staining oftheepithe-
lialcells occurred, with notable staining ofthebasal cells. In
undifferentiated malignant tumors, intense HO-I staining
was manifest innearly alltumor cells, andalso intheepithe-
liallining ofblood vessels. HO-I intheprostate tissue was
found catalytically active and oxidatively cleaved theheme
molecule (Fe-protoporphyrin IX)tobiliverdin. Northern blot
analysis shows that two forms ofHO arepresent inthe
human prostate. Compared with normal tissue, predomi-
nantly hyperplastic tissue demonstrates apronounced
increase intheapproximately 1.8kbmRNA that hybridizes
totheratHO-I probe. The levels oftwotranscripts, approxi-
mately 1.3and approximately 1.7kb,that hybridize tothe
ratHO-2 probe arenotincreased inBPH tissue. CONCLU-
SIONS. The finding that HO-I expression isincreased in
BPH and malignant prostate tissue isconsistent with a
role forthis stress protein inthe pathogenesis ofBPH
and prostate cancer; inthecontext ofiron metabolism,
anargument ismade insupport ofthis possibility.

heme oxygenase: ageneral response tooxidant stress in
cultured mammalian cells. Applegate LA, Luscher P,
Tyrrell RM. Accumulation ofheme oxygenase mRNA is
strongly stimulated bytreatment ofcultured human skin
fibroblasts with ultraviolet radiation, hydrogen
peroxide, orthesulfhydryl reagent sodium arsenite (S.
M.Keyse and R.M.Tyrrell. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,
86:99-103, 1989). Since thiswill result inatransient reduc-
tion intheprooxidant state ofcells, thephenomenon may
represent animportant inducible antioxidant defense mecha-
nism. Toexamine thegenerality oftheresponse, wehave
measured the accumulation ofthe specific mRNA ina
variety ofhuman and mammalian cell types after inducing
treatments. Induction bysodium arsenite isobserved inall
additional human cell types tested. This includes primary
epidermal keratinocytes and lung and colon fibroblasts as
well asestablished cell lines such asHeLa,TK6 Iympho-
blastoid, and transformed fetal keratinocytes. Strong induc-
tion ofheme oxygenase mRNA isalso observed following
sodium arsenite treatment ofcell lines ofrat, hamster,
mouse, monkey, and marsupial origin. The agents which
lead toinduction incultured human skin fibroblasts fallinto
twocategories: (a)those which areoxidants orcangenerate
active intermediates (ultraviolet Aradiation, hydrogen
peroxide, menadione, and the tumor promoter,12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate); (b)agents which are
known tointeract with ormodify cellular glutathione levels
(buthionine sulfoximine, sodium arsenite, iodoacetamide,
diamide, and cadmium chloride). These observations
strongly support thehypothesis that induction oftheenzyme
isageneral response tooxidant stress inmammalian cells
andareconsistent with thepossibility thatthecellular redox
state plays akeyrole.

implications of the induction of human heme
oxygenase-l bynitric oxide donors. Takahashi K,Hara E,
Ogawa K,Kimura D,Fujita H,Shibahara S.Toexplore the
involvement ofnitric oxide (NO) intheinduction ofheme
oxygenase-I, anessential enzyme inheme catabolism, we
studied theeffects ofNOdonors ontheexpression ofheme
oxygenase-I mRNA inHeLahuman cervical cancer cells.
Treatment with each ofthree NO donors, sodium
nitroprusside, 3-morpholinosydnonimine, and
S-nitroso-L-glutathione, caused noticeable increases in
10
theexpression levels ofheme oxygenase- mRNA, butnot
heme oxygenase-2 mRNA. Ontheother hand, nitrite or
8-bromo cGMP exerted nonoticeable effect onthelevels of
heme oxygenase- 1mRNA. We showed that sodium
nitroprusside also increased thelevels ofheme oxygenase-t
protein. The sodium nitroprusside-mediated increase in
heme oxygenase-! mRNA levels wasabolished bytreatment
with actinomycin D.The expression levels ofheme
oxygenase- 1mRNA were also increased byNOdonors in
human melanoma and neuroblastoma celllines. Thus, the
observed induction ofheme oxygenase-l may represent an
important response toNO orNO-related oxidative stress.
The half lives ofheme oxygenase- 1andheme oxygenase-2
mRNAs were estimated tobeabout 3.2handmore than 5h,
respectively.

considerable evidence thatalthough estradiol may trigger the

required for itsfull magnitude and duration and that
glucocorticoids bring about selective follicle-stimulating
hormone release. The hormone-releasing
hormone (LHRH) neuron does nothave steroid receptors
andisregulated byexcitatory amino acid neurotransmission.
Steroids donotappear tomodulate excitatory amino

bysteroids oftheenzyme glutamatic acid decarboxylase67
that converts glutamate into GABA. NMDA receptors
colocalize with nitric oxide synthase-containing neurons that
surround the LHRH neurons inthe preoptic area and
intersect theLHRH fibers inthemedian eminence. Other
potential novel pathways ofLHRH release thatarecurrently
being explored include carbon monoxide generated bythe

suggested that nitric oxide (NO), asmall gaseous molecule
with amultiplicity ofcellular functions, plays animportant
part intheregulation ofcellular proliferation. We have
examined theeffect oftheNO donor sodium nitroprusside
(SNP) onheme oxygenase-I (HO-I) expression inhuman
epidermal keratinocytes and investigated the
contribution ofthe heme oxygenase pathway inthe
control of keratinocyte proliferation. Incubation of
keratinocytes with 0.5 mM SNP resulted ina2.S-fold
increase inheme oxygenase activity which was reflected
1Ibyasignificant increase inHO-t protein expression, as
measured byWestern blot. This effect wasassociated with a
200% increase inkeratinocyte proliferation. The
prolife.rative effect oftheNOdonor wastotally abolished by
co-incubation ofSNP with tinprotoporphyrin IX,apotent
inhibitor ofheme oxygenase, orhydroxocobalamin, aNO

theAHR. Incontrast, hemin and biliverdin seem toinduce
Cyplal indirectly byserving asprecursors tothe
endogenous formation ofbilirubin via normal heme
metabolism pathways. This isthefirst direct demonstra-
tion that theendogenous heme metabolite bilirubin can
directly regulate Cypla Igene expression and enzymatic
activity inanAHR-dependent manner."

implications of the induction of human heme
oxygenase-l bynitric oxide donors. Takahashi K,Hara E,
Ogawa K,Kimura D,Fujita H,Shibahara SToexplore the
ofnitric oxide (NO) inthe'induction ofheme
oxygenase-I, anessential enzyme inheme catabolism, we
studied theeffects ofNOdonors ontheexpression ofheme
oxygenase-I mRNA inHeLa human cervical cancer cells.
Treatment with each ofthree NO donors, sodium
nitroprusside, 3-morpholinosydnonimine, and S-nitroso-
L-glutathione, caused noticeable increases in the
expression levels ofheme oxygenase- mRNA, but not
heme oxygenase-2 mRNA. Ontheother hand, nitrite or
8-bromo cGMP exerted nonoticeable effect onthelevels of
heme oxygenase-I mRNA. We showed that sodium
nitroprusside also increased thelevels ofheme oxygenase-l
protein. The sodium nitroprusside-mediated increase in
heme oxygenase-I mRNA levels wasabolished bytreatment
with actinomycin D.The expression levels ofheme
oxygenase-I mRNA were also increased byNOdonors in
human melanoma and neuroblastoma celllines. Thus, the
observed induction ofheme oxygenase-I may represent an
important response toNO orNO-related oxidative stress.
The half lives ofheme oxygenase-l andheme oxygenase-2
mRNAs were estimated tobeabout 3.2handmore than 5h,
respectively.

order toelucidate thepeculiarities ofbrain metabolism in
tumour-bearing organisms, thearterio-venous (A-V) content
ofglucose, acetoacetate (Ac-Ac), beta-hydroxybutyrate
(beta-HB) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) ingrowing
Zajdela ascite hepatoma (ZAH) and solid hepatoma 27
(H-27) was compared. Analysis ofmetabolic patterns of
healthy, starving and fed recipients (ZAH and H-27)
revealed the inadequacy ofthe concepts onanorexia as
being the cause of carbohydrate-lipid metabolic
disturbances. Intumour-bearing organisms lipolysis and
ketogenesis reflect the tumour-induced chronic stress.
Absorption ofbeta-HB and release ofAc-Ac bybrain were
observed atallstages ofmalignant growth. This isproba-
blydue toapartial switch-over ofbrain metabolism to
non-carbohydrate energy sources. Besides, certain stages
oftumour growth areassociated with active assimilation of
NEFA bybrain. Acorrelation between theA-V difference
with respect toglucose and Ac-Ac aswell asbetween the
glucose andNEF Acontents was established. Itwas assumed
that theA-V difference inglucose isthemain regulator of
ketone body metabolism.

the normal rattoaphysico-emotional stress. Turnbull
AV, Kim CK, Lee S,Rivier CL"We determined whether
thegas carbon monoxide (CO) altered theadrenocortico-
tropin hormone (ACTH) response tomild inescapable
electrofootshocks, andwhether itinteracted with nitric oxide
(NO). Peripheral injection oftheNOsynthase (NOS) inhibi-
tor Nomeganitro-L-arginine-methylester (L-NAME), a
compound which readily crosses theblood-brain barrier
produced theexpected blunting oftheACTH response
theshocks. This effect was mimicked byother arginine
analogues such asL-nitroarginine (L-NNA) andNG-methyl-
L-arginine (NMMA). The subcutaneous (s.c.) administration
oftheheme oxygenase (HO) blockers tinmesoporphyrin
(SnMP) or tin protoporphyrin (SnPP) significantly
decreased brain HO levels, indicating that both compounds
hadpenetrated thebrain." "SnMP and SnPP both decreased
shock-induced ACTH release, though themagnitude ofthis
effect was slightly lessthan thatofL-NAME. The influence
ofSnPP was further augmented inrats with concomitant
blockade ofNOformation, which suggests that both NOand
COarenecessary forthefullresponse ofthisaxis toelectro-
footshocks. Finally, theability ofSnPP tosignificantly blunt
theexpression ofthemRNA fortheimmediate early gene
NGFI-B inthe paraventricular nucleus (PVN) ofrats
exposed toshocks, indicates that theinfluence ofCO was
exerted onhypothalamic neuronal activity. Collectively, our
results show that NOandCOexert astimulatory effect on
the HPA axis response tomild electrofootshocks, and
that atleast part ofthis influence takes place on
hypothalamic neurons and/or their afferents."

regulates heme oxygenase-2 and NOsynthase transcrip-

BC, Maines MD Heme oxygenase (HO)-l and -2produce
carbon monoxide, which issuspected, asisnitric oxide
(NO), tofunction asaneuronal messenger. We report on
glucocorticoid-mediated modulation ofHO-2 and NO
synthase expression inbrain andthedifferential response of
thetwo proteins tocorticosterone indifferent brain regions.
Corticosterone treatment (40mg!kg, 20days) had opposing
effects on HO-2 and NO synthase transcript levels:
13
increasing the 1.3- and 1.9-kb HO-2 mRNAs and
decreasing that ofthebrain-specific 10.5-kb NOsynthase.
Corticosterone did not uniformly affect HO-2 protein
expression inallregions, butappeared tocause auniversal
reduction inNO synthase, e.g., HO-2 was decreased in
hippocampus (CA 1and dentate gyrus), but not in
cerebellum. Incontrast, NADPH diaphorase staining was
reduced inhippocampus andinmolecular andgranule layers
ofcerebellum (not detected inPurkinje cells). Striking
deficits inneuronal morphology and number of
diaphorase-staining neurons were observed inthelateral
tegmental area, paraventricular nucleus, and frontal
cortex; HO-2 expression was only selectively affected. In
cerebellum, activity ofNOsynthase, butnotthat ofHO,
was reduced. Consistent with thepossibility that carbon
monoxide cangenerate cyclic GMP, thechange incyclic
GMP level did notmirror thedecrease inNOsynthase.
We suggest that glucocorticoid-mediated deficits in
hippocampal functions may reflect their negative effect
onmessenger-generating systems.

that tumour cells invivo canactually maintain thebioener-

that may play arole. Growing evidence now suggests
that, inaddition tothese endogenous factors, theexoge-

mutagenic and constitute asignificant source ofgenetic
instability. The tumor microenvironment ischaracter-
ized byregions offluctuating hypoxia, low pH, and
nutrient deprivation. Each ofthese microenvironmental
factors hasbeen shown tocause severe disturbance incell
metabolism and physiology. Both invivo and invitro data
