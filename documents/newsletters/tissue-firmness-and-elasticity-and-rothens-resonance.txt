Tissue Firmness and Elasticity,
andRothen's Resonance:
Forgotten Physics andAging
The most interesting problems exist exactly
where theprofessionals assert that there isno
problem atall.
The space between cells isofinterest tomany
specialists, butitisrelegated tothebackground in
mainline medical thinking. Inreality, thestuff
between cells isthebiggest part ofacomplex
organism, anditcontains many oftheanswers to
questions ofindividuality, immunity, growth,
aging, healing, sickness, andregeneration.
Respiration isessential fortheexistence of
higher organisms, making itpossible to
maintain complex and adaptive structures,
containing appropriately differentiated cells. I
want tointroduce some ideas about how respi-
ration isinvolved inthecreation ofstructures
both inside cells and inthespaces between
cells.
The idea of"containment inthecell" has
directed attention away from theways inwhich
acell knows what itisand where itis,atld
where itshould be,what itshould do.
The material inbetween cells has been
dismissed aslittle more than glue, butitis
.where some ofour most important things
happen.
Butfirst, Iwant tooutline some ofthemental
habits and fixations that have been retarding
biology and medicine foralong time, keepingpeople from thinking about these organismic
Issues.
THE BIAS AGAINST SENSITIVITY
Indead vegetable matter, "cells" were the
empty spaces inthefibrous framework. Plants
could begrafted orpropagated from cuttings,
making itclear thatone type ofplant tissue could
generate theother types. The "essence" ofplants
wasconsidered tobelittle more than growth, and
their seeds had thedisadvantage ofintroducing
individual variation. Grafting and cloning
animals didn't seem towork, andtheidea grew up
that theanimal's essence was contained inthe
germ cell, while theplant's essence was inits
vegetation.
"Contained" inthe"cell," our"essence" had
Carbonated water issuch acommon thing,
chemists areembarrassed totalkabout it.
All the water inrespiring organisms
contains aconsiderable amount ofcarbon
-dioxide.
Carbon dioxide binds toproteins and to
other amine-containing polymers, anddissolves
inwater, reducing thepH,sothat theinterac-
tions ofpolymers and water are strongly
affected bytheconcentration ofC02.
Carbon dioxide modifies biological materi-
alsandstructures inandaround ourcells .
only toreveal itself. Aman's semen was his
essence, which introduced thesoul into theegg,
animating it.Replacing "preformationism" with
"epigenesis" simply introduced the idea of
individualism, bysaying that anew individual
came into existence byfertilization, butitdidn't
end thebelief that ouridentity was "contained"
"genetically" within thecell.
The neat little compartments seen inplant
tissues became asortofmental annature that no
onequestioned. Almost allofbiology hasbeen
reduced totheidea that "the informa-
tion iscontained within thecell, initsgenes."
The "Central Dogma" ofmolecular biology was'
stated as"information flows from DNA toRNA
andfrom RNA toprotein, andnottheother way."
Tospeak ofcellular sensitivity (asLamarck did)
istoassert that information flows into cells; the
fanatical opposition toLamarck that hascharac-
terized biology inthe20th century hasblended
into ageneral hatred of"vitalism," theidea that
lifecould beexplained interms ofitsspecial,
living qualities. The dogmatists insist that life
must beexplained interms ofphysics asthey
understand it,and ithappens that their
"physics" isnothing butadoctrinal relic kept
inplace tojustify their conceptions ofbiology.
The idea that cells aregoverned bytheir
responses towhatever surrounds them hastaken a
long time todevelop, andthedogmatists stillfeel
that there issometfuIlg impermissibly "vitalistic"
intheidea that cells aresensitive orresponsive.
Tobesensitive istoreceive information from
"outside," and sotheanti-Lamarckian ideas of
evolution and adaptation were extended into the
fields ofdevelopment, immunity, aging, even
learning. "Clonal selection" hasbeen proposed to
explain everything that happens intheorganism,
from development tocancer, because thisview is
compatible with the doctrine that information
flows only from thegenes tothecell; thecells
simply dieifthey don't contain thenecessary
information. "Programmed celldeath," inwhich a
genetic code--a program, like acomputer
program--specifies thetime atwhich acellwill
die,isacharacteristic part ofthisdoctrine about
thenature ofacomplex organism.
Ithink itisnecessary tolook atthese estab-
lished ideas, which areabsurd and unfounded,
because weareforced towallow inthem every
day, until people have come totreat them asif
they were intelligent, intellectually responsible,
descriptions ofreality; ifwerealize that silly
ideas and connotations have been built into ourlanguage, then wecanbegin togive serious atten-
tiontothe"anomalies" ofscience.
"Anomalies" arefacts thatdon't obey thelaw,
andsothey areofspecial importance foranyone
who cares about understanding things. Ifyou
have some parts leftover after you have assem-
bled apuzzle, maybe thepuzzle wasn't correctly
assembled. So-called anomalies areoften the
most productive places tolook forsolutions.
CELLULAR JUDGMENTS
That cells may besmall orlarge orgiant hasn't
seemed problematic tomost biologists. The
assumption seems tohave been thatthey "are big
enough tocontain their essential genes. "
Once ortwice, Ihave gotbiologists totalk
about thequestion ofhow acellknows that itis
bigenough todivide. Ithink theessence oftheir
answer issomething like "they count the
molecules," which istoembarrassingly compound
thepuzzle, like thefarmer who explained his
marvelous ability torapidly count thecows ina
field bysaying that he"simply counted theteats
anddivided byfour."
The same kind ofquestion canbeapplied to
thethickness oflayers ofextracellular material,
such asthebasal lamina ofcapillaries. For
example, granted thatacellshould restonastruc-
ture ofacertain uniform thickness, how does a
cell know when tostop secreting thematerial?
When itismodifying thechemical composition of
itsextracellular matrix, how does itdetermine
that theright composition has been achieved,
when thesubstance isoutside thecell?
Cells have to,insome sense, perceive
themselves and their environment, because
their environment isanessential part oftheir
existence, governing what they areand what
they can become. Tounderstand thenature of
cellular perception, wehave tolook beyond exist-
ingdescriptions ofwhat cells are.
Inplants, thefibrous, cellulose-based walls
between cells don't prevent all interactions
between cells, butthey dokeep thecells from
wandering, andthey actasstable regulators ofthe
cells' functions. Animal cells also have a
carbohydrate-rich layer surrounding them, which
powerfully regulates their functions, butthislayer
ismuch more adjustable than thecellulose frame-
work ofplants. .
The chemical andstructural plasticity ofthis
intercellular material isanessential part ofthe
greater sensitivity andcomplexity ofanimals, and
while itisnow conventional todescribe this
material aspart ofasignalling and regulatory
system, Ithink itmight also be appropriate to
think ofitaspart ofthecell's sensory system. It
forms abuffer zone around acellthatisstrongly
conditioned bythecell's own activity, andwhen
thiszone isaltered bythepresence ofanother cell,
orwhen itscomposition changes because ofinjury
orinfection, theinfluence from that buffer zone
hastochange processes inthecell. Forexample,
ifwecompare these layers toafilm ofsoap
around adrop ofoil,thesurface tension-and
therefore the shape-can change radically
under theinfluence ofphysical and chemical
agents, such astemperature, salts oracids.
Theforces inside cells thatcontribute totheir
shape, interact with external forces andwith inter-
nalandexternal chemical reactions. Thecompo-
sition oftheextracellular matrix isnow known to
have aprofound regulatory influence onthecell's
genes. The cell's "phenotype" (our phenotype is
what weappear tobe)isregulated bytheextracel-
lular matrix, incombination with avariety of
hormonal, nutrititional, andmetabdic factors.
ADIFFERENT PHYSICS
Inthestudy ofcohesion, adsorption, radiation,
diffraction, andresonance, there hasbeen astrong
tendency toavoid questions ofthe"ensemble," in
favor oftheunique, oratmost double, event or
situation--one ortwoatoms ormolecules, oneor
two frequencies--and beyond that, todescribe
things with "statistical, stochastic, colligative"
assumptions andmethods. Crystallography isan
attempt tounderstand ensembles ofatoms or
molecules, butitrepresents theopposite extreme
ofabstraction, letting geometry replace concrete
data about events intime andplace. What has
always been leftoutistheway inwhich long
range order interacts with local, anddelocalized,
energy. There have been observations withrelevance tothese issues, butthey have been "left
out"because they were "anomalous."
These interactions oftheparts ofanensemble
over distances many times greater than thesizeof
anatom areofspecial importance forbiology;
they arewhere wefind allthemost interesting
questions inbiology.
The way thevarious "anomalies" fittogether
isamatter forageneral revision ofscience, butin
biology, thework ofAlexander Rothen gives us
atool forbeginning tomake sense ofsome of
therealities ofbiology that have seldom been
thought about.
When Ibegan studying biology attheUniver-
sity ofOregon, the bulletin board near the
electron microscope room displayed some photo-
graphs ofcrystals that professor Bajer hadbeen
making. One ofthem showed aquartz crystal,
over which athinfilm ofplastic hadbeen coated.
Ontopoftheplastic film sodium atoms hadbeen
deposited, showing that they were being aligned
inapattern conforming tothatoftheunderlying
quartz crystal. The film was much thicker than
theunits ofsilicon dioxide intheunderlying
crystal, sothearrangement ofthesodium atoms
wasobviously notbeing determined byeither the
position oftheplastic polymer molecules, orthe
relatively remote individual silicon and oxygen
atoms below thefilm, butsomehow byaprojec-
tionofthepattern ofthequartz crystal. Order had
been projected through thedisordered layer of
polymer.
Earlier, Ihadread some ofMichael Polanyi's
work with long-range effects incrystals, andknew
about hisadsorption work, inwhich theadsorp-
tiveforce oftheunderlying charcoal wasable to
make itself feltthrough several layers ofatoms,
continuing tocause more atoms tocondense from
thegasphase. Later, multilayer adsorption was
explained astheresult ofelectronic resonance.
Rothen, using thetechniques hehadinvented
formeasuring thethickness ofextremely thin
films, found thatmetal-plated glass slides, coated
with albumin, would bind multiple layers of
antibodies which were specific forthe albumin.
Or,before theslide wasexposed toantibodies, it
could becoated with aplastic (Formvar) film 120
Angstrom units thick, and still, layers of
antibodies upto80Angstroms thick could be
adsorbed.
Polanyi's multilayer adsorption was consid-
ered impossible bytheleading physicists ofthe
time, butthesimple idea ofelectronic resonance
eventually made itpossible forthem toaccept the
facts. But Rothen's adsorption ofmultilayers of
immunologically specific proteins was just too
much.
Acouple ofyears after Ihad seen Bajer's
micrographs, Iasked him about them, and hesaid
hedidn't remember; already, theopinion makers
inscience had reacted toexperiments inwhich
cells appeared tobe"feeling" anartificially
constructed gradient through aplastic film, by
claiming that photographs had revealed tiny
holes inthefilms, and thecells had been reach-
ingthrough the holes and feeling thegradient
directly. The cheating cells (like mind-readers
who peek through their blindfolds) had been
"exposed," and all the long-range trans-
membrane phenomena had fallen into
disrepute.
Even ifthecells were "cheating" byreaching
through holes inthefilm, thefact that they could
sense the direction ofthe gradient, and move
consistently "up the gradient," was never
challenged, and itwasn't explained how reaching
through theplastic could allow them toevaluate
thegradient onthebasis ofafew samples-that in
itself might require amore complicated explana-
tion than theoriginal idea, sensing thegradient
through afilm, required The meaning ofthis
episode isthat themost influential scientists will
seize even anirrelevant criticism asanexcuse for
ridiculing ideas that violate their dogma.
But pores inplastic films, that cells might
poke their fingers through, had noconceivable
relevance toRothen's work (nor toBajer's).
Rothen's technique could measure thethickness
ofthelayers ofantibodies, and show that they
were continuous layers, several antibodies
thick. Antibodies toalbumin aren't supposed to
bind tothemselves. The technique was sosimple
that aphysicist visited Rothen's lab, learned his
technique, and then claimed tohave invented itas
amethod forsimplifying immunological testing.
But hewanted only the commercial value ofRothen's discovery, and ignored itsessential
importance.
Rothen's specific long-range adsorption, like
Polanyi's earlier work, simply couldn't be
responded toinarational way. Arational
response might have been toreason this way: If
the organization ofthe underlying material
projects itself strongly into theenvironment, then
patterns inthe environment must also make
themselves felt intheunderfying material. The
same mechanism would amount toanaction anda
perception.
There were fields such asmetallurgy, inwhich
long-range forces, and theeffects ofsurfaces on
crystal structure, were "normal science," but in
biology, physics had been reduced tothe ideas
that were dominant in1915.
The conformation ofalarge molecule ispart
ofitsbiological orimmunological specificity.
The specificity ofconformation ofany molecule
must participate inthe specific nature ofthe
ensemble, and that ofthe ensemble, inthe
individual molecule. For example, certain
enzyme molecules are known to arrange
themselves one way inthe cytoplasm, and
another, random way when they areexamined in
the unnatural environment of biochemist's
test-tube.
Since Polanyi's multilayer adsorption was
explained asaresonance phenomenon, thesame
term could beapplied toRothen's specific adsorp-
tion, without implying that weunderstand exactly
how itworks.
Rothen also showed that enzymes can act
across thefilms. Tome, themain importance of
this would betohighlight theextent towhich an
archaic physical view has governed biochemical
thinking. The action ofanenzyme atadistance
means that itscatalytic region might belarger
than previously supposed, butitalso suggests that
we can't generalize from the behavior ofan
enzyme dissolved inwater, toitsbehavior inthe
cell, where itwould besubject tothereciprocal
effects ofmany other components ofthecomplex
system. Biochemists have claimed that "biochem-
istry couldn't exist ifyou doubted that the
function ofenzymes insolution isidentical tothe
function ofenzymes inthe cell," but other··Af
biochemists have demonstrated that some ofthe
most basic assumptions ofbiochemistry were
mistaken (Bernhard, 1988), including the
assumption that theenzymes ofglycolysis act
onsubstrates that are floating around in
solution.
Digestive enzymes, added toasolution
containing thefood materials nonnally digested in
theintestine bythose enzymes, failed toalter the
food materials ataratethatcould becompared to
that ofnonnal digestion. But when a
fonnalehyde-fixed piece ofintestine wasadded to
themixture, thereactions occurred atapproxi-
mately the rate that isnonnal fordigestion.
Although inyoung infants digestion does happen
inthefluid contents oftheintestine, after theage
ofone, most ofthe action ofthe digestive
enzymes occurs atornear thesurface oftheintes-
tine, under theinfluence oftheadsorbed enzymes.
This isanother clear example oftheidea that
enzymes aredependent ontheir environment.
Whether ornotcells areable to"feel" what is
beneath aplastic film, recent evidence indicates
thatthethickness andcomposition ofthematerial
they sitondoes make adifference. Their genes
areturned onbythestructures that aresensed in
the extracellular matrix, and the longevity,
growth, function anddeath ofthecells aredeter-
mined bythenature ofthesubstances outside the
cell.
The implication ofmuch current research is
thatifallofthespecific protein filaments canbe
identified that fonn links between thestructural
filaments inside cells and thematrix materials
outside thecells, thepowerful influence ofthe
external matrix onthe cells' functions will
somehow beexplained without having tothink in
tenns ofphysical ensembles. "This protein on
oneside ofthe[imaginary] cellmembrane tugs
onaprotein ontheother side," and then maybe
thelittle homunculus who counts molecules will
decide the time isright forhim tocarry a
message tothecorrect gene toturn iton.
Itisprobably truethatageneral picture canbe
completed after allofthedetails arepresent, butit
isn't necessarily true that thespecific interpreta-
tion will bemeaningful. Butatthepresent, wecanseesome ofthemeanings oftheinteraction
between matrix andcell.
MUCUS, MUCINS, AND MYOPIA
The importance ofcarbon dioxide forrespira-
tion hasbeen established, anditsessentiality for
even single-celled organisms hasbeen reported.
Whenever there isrespiration, carbon dioxide is
produced Bymaintaining theeffective concen-
tration ofKrebs cycle material, itprotects the
efficiency ofrespiration. Carbon dioxide isvery
soluble inwater, butitiseven more soluble in
living tissue, sosoluble that itwill move from a
low concentration inbath water into thebody,
where itsconcentration isalready much higher.
Itshigh concentration inbone isnotusually
appreciated, butcalcium carbonate isthefonn in
which calcium isfirst deposited innew bone.
Carbon dioxide reacts spontaneously with
ammonia, andwith other amines. The reaction of
ammonia with carbon dioxide isthefirst step in
the fonnation ofurea, protecting against the
potential toxicity ofammonia. Proteins probably
bind alittle more carbon dioxide ontheir amino
groups than theamount thatdissolves inasimilar
quantity ofwater, butbiologists generally talk
only about thecarbamino content ofhemoglobin,
since thebinding ofcarbon dioxide tothisprotein
regulates theblood's ability todeliver oxygen to
thetissues.
Carbon dioxide strongly influences theway in
which water interacts with proteins, anditpartici-
pates intheability ofiron-binding molecules to
carry iron.
Although carbon dioxide probably associates
with most oftheamino groups inthebody, only a
few ofthese reactions have been studied. For
example, itisknown tobind toinsulin, affecting
itsconfonnation. Ithink thisislikely toexplain
some oftheeffects ofthethyroid honnone in
diabetes, since thyroid increases theproduction of
carbon dioxide.
Mucins, ormucopolysaccharides, arecombi-
nations ofproteins and polysaccharides, which
make upalarge partoftheextracellular matrix;
theblood-type substances aremucopolysaccha-
rides, asarechondroitin andhyaluronic acid. The
carbohydrate chains ofthemucins aremade upof
alternating sugars and amino sugars. When the
amino groups are free, they will tend toassociate
with carbon dioxide, and sotheway they interact
with water, with each other, and with proteins,
will bemodified according tothe amount of
carbon dioxide present.
The simplest way tovisualize the effect of
carbon dioxide onmucopolysaccharides isto
think ofitsaction asanexpectorant, inwhich it
decreases theviscosity ofbronchial mucus, allow-
ingittobereabsorbed orexpelled. Since iodide
also hasalong history ofuseasanexpectorant,
weshould compare theeffects ofcarbon dioxide
and carbonic acid with theeffects ofiodide in
other situations.
The transparent structures oftheeyeareinter-
esting places forconsidering theeffects ofcarbon
dioxide. Ithink carbon dioxide has arole in
maintaining theclarity ofthelens, asIdiscussed
in the cataracts newsletter, by preventing
swelling. The connective tissues ofthe eye's
sclera and cornea are rich in
mucopolysaccharides, and thevitreous body and
theaqueous humor arevery much like more dilute
solutions ofthesame materials--the cornea isthe
most dense, and theaqueous isthemost dilute.
The fluidity oftheaqueous isimportant because it
circulates nutrients andoxygen from theblood, to
sustain thelens and thecornea. The individual
molecules intheaqueous arelarger than those in
thevitreous, butbecause there arefewer ofthem,
theaqueous isn't very viscous. Ifcarbon dioxide
affects these molecules asitdoes themucins in
thebronchial secretions, then wecan infer that it
isimportant inmaintaining the fluidity ofthe
aqueous humor; this would suggest that
hypothyroidism, leading toasubstitution of
lactic acid forcarbon dioxide, might contribute
tothe development ofglaucoma byincreasing
theviscosity ofthe aqueous humor.
Among mountain climbers, ithas been
reported that after staying several hours atavery
high altitude, there isadecrease inthedegree of
myopia. Because oftheHaldane-Bohr effect, in
which carbon dioxide isretained when less
oxygen isavailable, Ithink thehigh altitude effect
on myopia involves acondensation oftheconnective tissue. Inexperimenters wearing gas
tight goggles, and inscraped corneas kept in
tissue culture, carbon dioxide hasbeen found to
have ananti-swelling effect onthecornea.
When rats have their thyroid glands removed,
they become nearsighted, but iftheir pituitary
glands areremoved atthesame time, they don't
develop myopia. Hypothyroidism isclassically
associated with "myxedema," inwhich thetissues
become overloaded with the glycoproteins or
mucins. Several pituitary hormones areknown to
stimulate theoverproduction ofmucins.
Inseveral ofmyclasses, Iasked students if
they remembered when they became nearsighted.
Although puberty istheusual time formyopia to
begin, several girls mentioned that they had
needed glasses within amonth ofbeginning the
oral contraceptive pill, and some ofthem found
that their vision returned tonormal when they
stopped thepill, orbegan using thyroid supple-
ments. High prolactin (associated with high estro-
gen orlow thyroid) may beone ofthefactors in
myopia.
Another experimental method forproducing
myopia istocover theeyeofagrowing animal, or
tokeep the animal inconstant darkness. In
darkness, the eye grows larger than normal,
causing therefractive error ofmyopia, and the
sclera issoft and weak. Since stimulated nerves
consume oxygen andemit carbon dioxide, Ithink
darkness might mimic hypothyroidism, allowing
theconnective tissues toswell.
The seacucumber hasbeen used tostudy the
physical properties ofconnective tissue, andithas
been found that certain salts tend tosoften the
connective tissues, butthat iodide doesn't. The
well-established useofiodide toresolve granulo-
mas, even when itdoesn't eliminate theinfectious
agent, might suggest that itisprotecting against
something which isdisrupting the connective
tissue structure.
The only publications Ihave seen that
presented clear evidence ofthedisappearance of
arteriosclerosis involved treatment with iodides.
Intheretina, blood vessels can beseen toreturn
totheir normal appearance following acourse of
iodide treatment. Besides itspossible direct
effects onthe mucins, iodide might help to
eliminate calciwn from thewalls ofblood vessels,
since calciwn iodide isvery soluble.
Inaging, connective tissue becomes hardened
bychemical cross-linking ofthelarge molecules.
Ifamino groups arewell saturated with carbon
dioxide, this type ofreaction should beinhibited
(Carbon dioxide also inhibits theproduction of
freeradicals, which areinvolved insome types of
cross-linking reactions.) The waterlogged condi-
tion seen during shock orstress inblood vessels,
lungs, and other organs, and theedema ofthe
brain and cataracts ofthe lenses that follow
metabolic impairments ofvarious sorts, seem to
involve theuptake of"free" water, atthesame
time that "bound" (unfreezable) water islost.
Carbon dioxide seems topromote theretention of
bound water, andprotects against theedematous
conditions. The swelling ofmuscles during
hypoxic stress probably represents the basic
process, inwhich lactic acid and pHincrease,
while C02 j8lost.
Whatever thecell's "membrane" structure may
be,Rothen's demonstration ofthedeep interac-
tions ofadjacent layers showed thattheconditions
oneither side ofthesurface ofacell arevery
sensitive toconditions ontheother side.
Since themucopolysaccharides regulate cell
division, cell shape and motility, cell longevity
and cell death, and carbon dioxide has very
powerful structural effects onthemucopolysac-
charides, thecell, byproducing carbon dioxide, is
stabilizing itsregulatory framework, theextracel-
lular matrix, atthesame time thatitstabilizes the
intracellular proteins andsystems ofmetabolism ..
The thyroid hormone isthemost important
promoter ofcarbon dioxide formation.

concentration oftheexcessive enzyme sites inthe cell is
sufficiently high sothat nearly allthecellular intermediary
metabolites areenzyme-bound. (3)Enzyme conformations
are perturbed bythe interactions with substrates and
products; the conformations ofenzyme-substrate and
enzyme-product complexes aredifferent. (4)Two enzymes,
catalyzing reactions that are sequential inametabolic

anenzyme-enzyme complex without theintervention ofthe

substantially alters existent views ofthebioenergetics andthe

therates ofinterconversion between substrate and product

Appropriate cell-to-substrate adhesion together with SGF
stimulation isnecessary toinitiate and continue cellcycle
progression of growth arrested cells. Adhesion-
dependent signaling events, which likely occur through
integrin receptors specifically organized with cytoskeletal

Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrurn, Heidelberg, Germany.
Histochem Cell BioI, 1996 Mar, 105:3, 179-85 Matrigel and
collagen Ggels were used asmodels forbasement membrane
and interstitial space-collagen, respectively, tostudy the
invasive behavior ofcells ofthehuman lung tumor cellline
EPLC 32MI, which was derived from asquamous cellcarci-
noma. Forthree dimensional analysis oftheinvasive process,
cells were seeded onto the gels inaslide chamber and
observed with aconfocal laser scanning microscope. Optical
sectioning inthexyandxzdirections andimage reconstruc-
tion with computer programs allowed usreadily toobtain a
three-dimensional overview oftheinvasive process insitu.
Both types ofgelshowed asmooth surface. Matrigel hada
granular structure whereas collagen Grevealed afiber-like
morphology. The tumor cells showed amatrix-dependent
behavior. On within 24hofincubation, anetwork
ofcells appeared onthesurface, which developed further
within 72htointerconnected multicellular cords also invad-
ingthegel. Tumor cells seeded oncollagen Gremained
individual. They formed pseudopodia and achieved tight
contact with thematrix, eventually also invading thegels ina
time-dependent manner. Therefore, thecomposition ofthe
substrate crucially influences theinvasion path,"
"Modulation ofprotein tyrosine phosphorylation bythe
extracellular matrix," Corbett SA; Schwarzbauer JEJSurg
Res, 1997 Apr, 69:I,220-5 Fibronectin (FN) cross-linked to
fibrin following injury provides the provisional matrix
required forcells tobegin tissue repair. Our previous work
hasdemonstrated that fibroblasts adherent tomultimeric FN
within thecontext ofafibrin matrix (FN-fibrin) exhibit clear
phenotypic differences from those adherent toadimeric
FN-coated surface. We hypothesize that this response to
multirneric FNmay bemediated byaltered protein tyrosine
phosphatase activity following integrin activation. Methods:
NllI 3T3 cells were plated inthepresence orabsence of
pervanadate (PV), aphosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor,
onwells coated with FNorFN-fibrin matrix. Spread cell
areas were measured after increasing incubation times and
are recorded asmean cell area (mm2) +/- SEM.
Alternatively, cells were lysed and equal amounts ofprotein
were analyzed byimmunoblot using amonoclonal antibody
specific forphosphotyrosine. Results: PVsignificantly inhib-
ited cell spreading onFN-fibrin matrices. Incontrast, PV
treatment hadlittle effect oncellarea onFNalone. Analysis
ofcellIysates revealed that protein tyrosine phosphoryla-
tion events differ inasubstrate-dependent manner.
Conclusion: Cell attachment toaFN-fibrin matrix
induces distinct cellshape and cytoskeletal organization.
Inactivation oftyrosine-specific phosphatases enhances this
distinction andinhibits thespreading ofcells attached tothis
substrate. The phosphotyrosyl protein content oftreated
cells onFN-fibrin matrix isalso diminished. These results
suggest that cell-extracellular matrix interactions affect
the tyrosine phosphorylation balance ofthecell, thus
modifying cytoskeletal organization and related signaling
events."
"Inhibition ofanchorage-dependent cell spreading
triggers apoptosis incultured human endothelial cells,"
ReF;Zanetti A,Sironi M;Polentarutti N;Lanfrancone L;
Dejana E;Colotta FBorgomainerio, Milano, Italy. JCell
BioI, 1994 Oct, 127:2, 537-46 When cultivated on
substrates that prevent celladhesion (the polymer polyhy-
droxyethylmethacrylate, bovine serum albumin, andTeflon),
human endothelial cells (EC) rapidly lostviability with ahalf-
lifeofapproximately 10h.Dying ECshowed themorpho-
logical and biochemical characteristics ofapoptosis. The
apoptotic process ofsuspended EC was delayed bythe
protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Toobtain infonna-
tion astothe mechanism involved inthe apoptosis of
suspended EC, weinvestigated whether adhesion tomatrix
proteins orintegrln occupancy inECretaining around
shape may affect ECsuicide. ECbound tolow coating
concentration ofeither fibronectin orvitronectin, retaining
around shape and failing toorganize actin microftla-
ments, underwent torapid celldeatb; bycontrast, cells on
higb substrate concentrations became flattened, sbowed
actin microftlament organization, and retained viability.
Addition ofsaturating amounts ofsoluble vitronectin to
suspended round-shaped ECdidnotreduce theprocess of
apoptosis. Finally, when suspended ECbound G1y-Arg-Gly-
Asp-Ser-coated microbeads (approximately 10
microbeadslcell), yetretaining around shape, theapoptotic
process was not affected. Oncogene-transformed EC in
suspension were lesssusceptible tocelldeath andapoptosis
than normal EC. Overall, these data indicate thatcellattach-
ment tomatrix orintegrin binding perseisnotsufficient for
maintaining cell viability, and that cells need toundergo
some minimal degree ofshape change tosurvive. Modulation
ofinteraction with theextracellular matrix can, therefore, be
animportant target forthecontrol ofangiogenesis.

Kinetics ofdecreased LPS-stimulated cytokine release
bymacrophages exposed toC02. West MA, Baker J;
Bellingham J,JSurg Res, 1996 Jun, 63:1, 269-74. "The
mechanisms responsible for the lack ofinflammation
after laparoscopic surgery remain unknown. Peritoneal
macro phages (Mphi) incubated incarbon dioxide (C02)
but notairorhelium (He), had significant, reversible
inhibition oflipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-l (lL-l) release. In
these experiments thekinetics ofthese C02-induced altera-
tions incytokine secretion were examined. Murine perito-
neal Mphi were stimulated with LPS for4hrandincubated
in different test gases (95% air/5%
C02,800/oC02l200/o02.80% Hel20% 02) for intervals
between 0.25 and 4hr.Time between gasincubation and
LPS stimulation was varied todetermine thepersistence of
C02 inlubition. Parallel Mphigroups received LPS stimula-
tion 24hrlater. Supernatant TNF andIL-l were measured
bybioassay and polymerase chain reaction was used to
examine cytokine mRNA Significant reversible inhibition of
TNF andIL-lwasseen with C02, butnotHeorair.inhibi-
tion ofIL-l occurred 15min after C02 exposure, was
associated with decreased ll..-1 mRNA, andwas rapidly lost
following incubation inthecontrol atmosphere. TNF inhibi-
tion was seen despite normal levels ofTNF message,
required more than 30minofC02 exposure, andpersisted
after C02 removal. C02 produced profound, reversible,
inhibition ofLPS-stimulated cytokine release byperito-
neal Mpbi. The transient inability tosecrete inflamma-
tory cytokines after C02 exposure may explain thelack
ofsystemic inflammation after laparoscopic surgery with
C02."
"Do plasma and serum have different abilities to
promote cellgrowth?" Gospodarowicz D;illCRProc Natl

plasma andserum tosupport thegrowth ofvascular smooth
muscle cells maintained onuncoated tissue culture dishes or
dishes coated with anextracellular matrix (ECM) have been
compared. Vascular smooth muscle cells maintained on
plastic dishes andexposed toplasma proliferate poorly; when
exposed toserum they proliferate actively. Addition offibro-
blast growth factor (FGF) incrases thegrowth rateofthe
cultures inboth cases. Incontrast, when vascular smooth

possibility that the lack ofresponse ofvascular smooth
muscle cells, aswell asthat ofother celltypes invitro, to
plasma factors isnotanintrinsic property oftheceUs but
israther due tothesubstrate upon which thecells rest.
Because ceUs maintained onanECM respond toplasma

Tauber JP1Cell Bioi, 1981 Iun, 89:3, 568-78 "Low density
vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cellcultures maintained on
extracellular-matrix(ECM)-coated dishes and plated inthe
presence ofeither plasma orserum will proliferate actively
when serum-containing medium isreplaced byasynthetic
medium supplemented with three factors: high density
lipoprotein (HDL, 250 micrograms protein/ml); insulin (2.5
microgramslml) orsomatomedin C(10ng/ml); andfibroblast
growth factor (FGF, 100ng/ml) orepidermal growth factor
(EGF, 50nglml). The omission ofanyofthese three factors
from thesynthetic medium results inalower growth rateof
thecultures, aswell asinalower fina1 cell density once
cultures reach confluence. When cells areplated inthetotal
absence ofserum, transferrin (10 microgramslml) isalso
required toinduce optimal cellgrowth. The effects ofthe
substrate andmedium supplements onthelifespan ofVSM
cultures have also been analyzed. Cultures maintained on
plastic and exposed tomedium supplemented with 5%
bovine serum underwent 15generations. However, when
maintained on ECM-coated dishes the serum-fed
cultures had alife span ofatleast 88generations.
Likewise, when cultures were maintained inasynthetic
medium supplemented with HOL andeither FGF orEGF, an
effect onthetissue culture lifespan bythesubstrate was
observed. Cultures maintained onplastic underwent 24
generations, whereas those maintained onECM-coated
dishes could bepassaged repeatedly for58generations·.
These experiments demonstrate the influence ofthe
ECM-substrate only inpromoting cellgrowth butalso in
increasing thelongevity ofthecultures. "

Cancer Res, 1978 Nov, 38:11 Pt2,4155-71 "Although the
problem ofcellular proliferation may seem atfirst glance
tobetremendously complex, the mechanisms which
control itmay beextremely simple. One oftheprimary
factors which regulates themitogenic response ofagiven
celltype toagiven class ofmitogenic agents seems tobe
thecellular shape. We have found that corneal epithelialcells, forexample, adopt aflattened configuration when
maintained invitro onplastic andarevery sensitive tofibro-
blast growth factor, but not toepidermal growth factor.
When maintained oncollagen, onthe other hand, they
become·tall andcolumnar andrespond primarily toepidermal
growth factor. The cellular shape isdictated invivo bythe
extracellular material upon which thecells rest and invitro
bythesubstrate upon which thecells aremaintained. The
substrate itself may, inturn, induce thecells tomanufacture
their extracellular material andspecific cellsurface proteins
which control thecellular shape. "

Effect ofhigh andlowdensity lipoproteins onprolifera-

Cheng 1;Gospodarowicz D1Clin Invest, 1980 Oct, 66:4,
696-708 "Bovine vascular endothelial cells maintained on
dishes coated with anextracellular matrix and exposedto
medium supplemented with lipoprotein-deficient serum
(LPDS) require thepresence oflipoprotein toproliferate
optimally. High density lipoprotein (HDL) seems tobethe
major factor involved inthe proliferation ofvascular
endothelial cells. This ismostly due toitslack oftoxicity
when added athigh concentration, aswell astoitsnonde-
pendence onLPDS toexhibit itsmitogenic properties.
Therefore, HOL hysiological concentrations (1,000--1,500
microgram protein/ml) canfully replace serum. Low density
lipoprotein, unlike HOL, has abiphasic effect. Although
mitogenic forvascular endothelial cells when added atlow
concentration, once physiological concentrations arereached
itbecomes toxic forthecells. Moreover, andincontrast with
HOL, themitogenic effect oflow density lipoprotein was
found tobeafunction oftheLPDS concentration towhich
cultures were exposed. The substrate upon which cultures
aremaintained hasbeen found tobeanimportant factor ifa
mitogenic effect ofHOL istobeobserved. When maintained
onplastic, cells proliferate poorly inresponse toHOL unless
fibroblast growth factor isadded tothe medium. In
contrast, when maintained onextracellular matrix, an
optimal growth rate isinduced byBDL, even inthe
absence offibroblast growth factor. This suggests that, in
vivo, the integrity ofthe basement membrane upon
which endothelial cells restand migrate isanimportant
factor indetermining thecells response tolipoproteins
present inplasma. "
