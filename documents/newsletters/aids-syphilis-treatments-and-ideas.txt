AIDS/Syphilis Treatments &Ideas
Twoofthebestartides onAIDSthatI
havereadarebyKatieLeishman inTM
Aliantic (August, 1987andJanuary,
1988).Intheearlierartide,shediscussed
someofthepoorlypublicized alternative
theories aboutthecauseofthedisease,
andpresented someofthearguments
aboutthemethod oftransmission,
especially aboutlice.IntheJanuary
article, sheconcentrate. onthe
association between AIDSandsyphilis.
Townsend Letter(orDoctorsJune1988leiShman quotestheargument ofJean
McKenna, ofBerkeley, thattheAIDS­
associated virus,HIV,isaby.productofthe
disease,ratherthanitacause,andthatit
probably onlyinfectssomeone whois
already immunosuppressed. Reading the
olderscientific Itterature, McKenna
learnedthatbothKaposi'. IIIln:Om8. and
pneumocysac cariniipneumonia hadbeen
associated withsyphilia.Theliterature suggeated that
syphilitic patients arepronetovarious
opportunistic infections, asAIDSpatients
are,although syphiliadoesnotappearto

Although alloftheirITA(fluorescent
treponema! antibody) testsshouldhave
beenreactive, twenty-one werenot.
McKenna speculated thatallAIDS
patients mighthavesyphilis.
In1981,beforeAIDShadbeen
recognized, twoGennan physicians, K.
OierigandU.Waldthaler, guessedthat
gonorrheal endocarditis mightbecausing
apatient's hotflashes,dTRsticweightloss,
shortness ofbreath,andconfusion, so
theytreatedhimwith40millionunitsof
penicillin intravenously eachdayfor
threeweeks.Hissymptoms disappeared,
andlatertheyfoundhetestedpositivefor
HIV,andareviewofhis'19B1 laboratory
tests·showed abnormalities consistent
withAlDS."DierigandWaldthaler then
usedthesamepenicillin treatment onsix
otherARCandAIDSpatients. Allseven
arenow"clinically asymptomatic.· (The
usualtreatment forsyphilisintheUSisa
singleinjection of2.4millionunitsof
benzathine penicillin. Thisformof
penicillin doesnotpenetrate thebrain.In
somecountries, syphilisistreatedfora
year.)
Leishman alsodescribes theworkof
Salvatore Catapano, ofValleyStream,
LongIsland.Thirtyyearsago,Catapano
learned thattheEnterobacteriaceae
stimulate immunity, andfoundthat
typhoidvaccinecouldstopthegrowthof
tumors. Whenhesawpatients with
Kaposi's sarcoma, hewasreminded of
syphilitic soreshehadseeninthetropics.
Catapano believes thatthetropical
spirochetal disease, yaws,shouldn't be
considered 88adistinct disease. He
advocates theuseoftyphoid vaccineto
stimulate theimmune system before
treating AIDSpatients withpenicillin.
Catapano alsobelieves that"syphilis"
infections canoccurwithoutthepresence
ofaspirochete, possibly byavirug..like
variantoftheorganism. Thisideahas
beenproposed manytimes,e.g.,by
Bergel, inSyphilis imLichteneuer
Untenuchungen, Jena,1925.
Afewmonths ago,D.J.Bauerof
Wellcome Laboratories, wroteanarticle
onthehistoryofantiviral drugs.Iknowof
his1959work,inwhichheshowedthat
copperinhibited thegrowthofalipid­
coatedvirusinthebrainsofmice,soIwas
surprised toseethathedidn'tmention

withtheintroduction ofamantadine in
1964totreatinfluenza (which,like herpes
andHIV,isalsolipid-coated). Ihadbeen

Bauergavenoexplanation oftheoriginof
amantadine.
Amantadine (oradamantaneamine) isa
watersolubleform(l-amino-adamatane) of
asubstance thatoccursinpetroleum. I
noticed thatadamantane smellslike
camphor, andthatithasacage-like shape
whichisverymuchlikethatofcamphor.
Camphor hasalonghistoryofuseasagerm­
killer(e.g.,Campho-phenique, forherpes),
andwasusedsuccessfully inthegreat
influenza epidemic 70yearsago.Iassume
thattheideaofusingamantlldine totreat
influenza wasbasedonitsobvious
similarity tonaturalcamphor. Anoxidized

Allthreeeliminated thesyphilis infection,
butthedrugcompanies werealreadysetup

Infection withthe"trench mouth"
organism, Ttepenema Vincenti, wasoften
associated withadeficiency ofwhiteblood
cells.Another spirochetal disease, Weil's
disease, involved fever,headache,
vomiting, andintestinal bleeding. Still
another typeofspirochetal infection was
knowninMexicoas"pinta," andmainly
involved depigmentation oftheskin.Early
inthecentury, someoftheabnormalities of
pigmentation, teethandhairdevelopment,
anddefectsinbloodvessels,thathadbeen
