Bioelectric Fields, Regenera-
tion, and theLactic Acid Myth
Exercise physiologists, knowing that lactic
acid isproduced during intense exercise, and
cancer biologists (especially since Warburg's work
showing that allcancers have arespiratory defect)
who know that cancer tends toproduce lactic
acid, almost always talk about the"acidity" ofthe
fatigued muscle orofthecancer cell.
While itistrue that theentry oflactic acid
into the blood tends toproduce metabolic
acidosis, thecell which isproducing thelactic
acid isactUally· more alkaline than normal cells.
The simplest way tothink ofitisthat "acid
leaving themuscle makes itlessacidic." Butstill,
even though thechemical formula forproducing
lactic acid directly shows the consumption of
acidity, anddirect measurements confirm that the
What wecall inflammation offers agood
conceptual link between thestudies onexcito-
toxicity orcellular stress, and. the newer
approaches .tothe treatment ofaging and
diseases, based onideas ofregen-
eration and development. Controlling Inflam-
mation becomes part -of promoting
regeneration. Injury potential and inflamma-
tion are closely related; for example, Ifound
that sunburned skin, orskin irritated bythe
application ofaprostaglandin, had anegative
polarity relative tonormal adjacent skin.
cells become more alkaline when they produce
lactate, theaverage biochemist orphysiologist is
likely-to think theopposite.
Lactic acid (oritsion, lactate) isinvolved in
stress, aging,. edema, inflammation, rheumatic
diseases, bioelectricity, nerve-muscle interactions,cancer, and theantiinflammatory actions ofthe
thyroid hormone, among other things, soafunda-
mental confusion about what it does tocells
means that much ofbiological and medical
opinion hasbeen unfounded. When Idiscussed
the cellular alkalinizing effect oflactic acid
formation inmydissertation in1972, itwasn't a
matter ofscientific dispute, and since then, the
newer techniques ofmeasurement have made the
situation even clearer. But, even today, almost
always when conclusions aredrav•.-nabout muscle
fatigue, cancer, radiation damage, etc., they are
based toalarge extent onthe.false assumption
about lactic acid andcellular pH. Aspecialist too
often builds onthegeneralizations thatarepropa-
gated bytextbooks andother mass media.
When thepHofacell ortissue changes, its
electrical properties change.
Inthe normal .!lody, repair isgoing on
constantly, and generally the new substance
conforms totheexisting pattern. The systems of
signals that overn these patterns are called
'develo mental fields and during the last 80
years, evidence has accumulated showing that
electrical fields participate inthese processes of
organization. (Child, 1921; McCaig, 1996.)
There isanelectrical field around organisms
and, internally, electrical fields contribute tothe
jdevelopment and/maintenance ofanatomical
structure. Sharks are able tofind small fish
buried under sand bydetecting their electrical
fields; they will dig torelectrical devices that
have similar fields. Large electrical fields have
been demonstrated extending away from the
surface ofskin, andsince these fields have some
ofthe properties ofa"static electrical field,"
many people have assumed that thecharge was
just something that passively accumulated by
friction.

nearly allofitslarge molecular componenents
and organelles will move toward the positive
pole.
When anelectrode ispoked into acell, it
registers anegative polarity relative totheneutral
outside. On alarger scale, ifyou put one
electrode onmoist skin, and putanother electrode
onacut, thecutskin will benegative relative to
the intact skin. This iscalled an "injury
potential." But theintact skin isitself negatively
charged, inthesame way that any whole cell is
negatively charged.
Ithasbeen suggested that sharks areattracted
towounded animals bytheelectrical field caused
bytheinjury, rather than bytheodor oftheblood,
since they can detect the injured animal from
distances far beyond the spread ofchemical
substances from theblood. The animal's "injury
potential")s apparently just anintensification of
theanimal's normal electrical field. (Although
much ofthe research onelectrical sensing has
been done onfish, Isuspect that land animals
sometimes useelectrical sensing. For example,
dogs can sense animpending epileptic seizure of
their owner; theelectrical fields created--by the
brain orthe skin--during anextreme metabolic
disturbance might belarger than those ofasmall
fish buried under sand People areable todetect
theflow ofaweak current inaburied wire, as
discussed by Barnothy and Barnothy in
Biomagnetics.)
Ihave seen articles inmajor science journals
that draw important conclusions from thenonex-
istent positive charge supposed tobeonthe
outside ofcells, andthose things have gotpast the
editors and referees because those ideas are so
current inourscientific culture. Less blatant, but
equally false, ideas areeven more prevalent. The
use ofvarious microelectrode techniques has
produced anabundance ofinformation oncel.\ular
electrical responses, butwith theexception ofthe
work ofGilbert Ling and afew others, the
meaning ofthedata isobscured byahuge culture
ofphantasy theories.
With thissortoffundamental confusion about
bioelectricity, itisn't surprising that the.re isso
little interest inthemorphogenetic influences ofBut an experimenter demonstrated the
presence ofanelectrical field extending outward
from theexternal surface ofpieces ofskin grown
inaculture dish. When cyanide was added tothe
medium, blocking ·respiration, thefield colla sed,
an wente c anide was washed outofthe ki,
aowing respiration to continue, the field
reappeared. Ihemtensity ofrespiration clearly
governs theintensity ofthefield. The researcher
suggested that the..field had thecharacteristics of
an"electret" field. Anelectret isacharge polari-
zation that results when the· molecules ofa
substance (wax orceramic) are aligned byan
external field while atarelatively high tempera-
ture, and then cooled.
-Heimplied that theenergy ofrespiration was
-causing analignment ofmolecules, resulting in
-thepolarization ofcharges. Any field ofthis sort
will influence other charged particles, and soitis
obvious that itwill participate inthearrangement
and organization ofparticles. The existence of
such fields probably influences thealignments of
particles within cells, and ofcells within organs.
There isatremendous difference inthestrength
ofthefield produced bydifferent individuals, but
thepattern isalways essentially thesame, except
when itisdistorted bypathological conditions;
tumors, forexample, distort thefield.
Ingeneral, cell orstimulation
increases theintensity ofcellular respiration, but
when oxygen isn't available, thestressed ordying
cell may become hyperactive. Epileptic seizures,
for example, can beproduced byhypoxia or
hypoglycemia, aswell asbyother stimuli such as
imbalances ofsalts andwater. .
Textbooks often represent cellular electricity
with adiagram showing theoutside ofacell as
"positive" relative tothe"negative" inside ofthe
cell. And researchers who have read those
textbooks uncritically sometimes speak ofthe
"positive" charge orfield outside acell. I'msure
they won't feel humiliated ifIpoint outthat the
whole thing isanartifact oftheir experimental
setup. Isolated cells inaliquid will move toward
the positive pole inanelectrical field, showing
that the cell outwardly has anegative charge.
This iscalled the sigma potential, orsurface
potential. And ifthecell ispulverized, again,"U
electrical fields. The textbook images of
"membrane potential" give theimpression either
thatrelevant fields don't exist, orthatthey arethe
opposite ofthose observed experimentally, and
those mistaken textbook images overwhelmingly
dominate thescientific-political-economic scene.
The overall charge onproteins and other
macrolecules is,ingeneral, amatter ofthepHof
their environment. Usually, cellular proteins have
anegative charge above apHof5.Theionization
ofchemical groups such ashydroxyl, amino, and
sulfhydryl areresponsible fortheoverall charge.
The degree ofoxidation orreduction affects the
number ofsulfhydryl groups, and thestructural
state oftheprotein also influences thecharge. At
high pHthecharge ishigh, and thenumber and
arrangement ofsulfhydryl groups canaffect the
charge. The presence ofsmall ions, carbon
dioxide, andoxygen also influence thecharge of
proteins. When the whole living system is
involved, bioelectricity interacts with other
electron-related phenomena, including oxidation-
reduction., pH, donor-acceptor and free radical
reactions.
Vlben thepHofblood ishigh, thecells of
blood vessels areexcited intocontraction. When
thepHoftheblood islow, nerve activity canbe
dulled tothe point· ofcoma, asindiabetic
acidosis. Ithink these effects ofpH, and the
simpler effects ofpH onprotein charge, are
closely related toeach other, andtothephenome-
nonoftheinjury potential.
Since proteins are generally negatively
charged, and tend tomove toward thepositive
pole when they are inanelectrical field, a
membrane made upofproteins (sheets orlayers
ofcells, forexample) will move inthesame
direction relative tothewater that permeates it,
meaning thatthewater will move intheopposite
direction, i.e., toward thenegative pole. This is
called electroosmosis. Since theelectrical charge
onproteins becomes more strongly negative when
thepHishigh, and less strongly negative when
thepHislow, water will tend tomove across
membranes from acidic regions into alkaline
regIons.The contracting muscle tends totake up
water, andforcing ittotake upwater increases its
tendency tocontract.
Oxygen, producing carbon dioxide, acidifies
thecell, andcarbon dioxide influences thecell's
handling ofwater. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
arecommonly used toregulate conditions involv-
ingedema, including adaptation tohigh altitudes.
During intense contraction, especially when
oxygen and carbon dioxide arelimited, muscles
produce lactic acid, andthespecific reaction in
wbicb lactic acid isformed causes protons tobe
consumed, tbat is,itraises tbepH.
Increased pH, decreased osmolarity, and
tbeassociated movements ofions increase the
cell's excitability.
Because ofthelong history ofthinking of
muscle fatigue andhypoxia intenns oflactic acid
production, andthemistaken idea thatintracellu-
larpHismore acidic inproportion totheproduc-
tion oflactic acid, theconfusion ofbiolectrical
ideas has been compounded bytheconfusion
about pH.
Cellular excitation, exhaustion, and injury
will affect thecell's electrical fields indifferent
ways depending ontheavailability ofoxygen.,
glucose, salts, etc., butineacb of states,
tbere isincreased entry ofcalcium into tbe
cytoplasm.
Calcium's entry intocells initself canlead to
increased excitation (muscle contraction, cramps,
and seizures, forexample), tocell death, orto
increased proliferation. (Ithasalso been thought
that sodium and water canstimulated prolifera-
tion. Forexample, Berman, etal.,1995.)
Something assimple asreducing thepHcan
prevent apoptotic ("organized" or"programmed")
cell death. (K.P. Hanson and V.E.Komar,
Molecular Mechanisms oftheRadiation Death of
Cells, Energoatomizdat, Moscow, 1985).
Carbon dioxide, produced byrespiration, and
ATPhydrolysis, aretwopowerful acidifiers ofthe
cell; with sufficient stimulation both canprobably
actsimultaneously, and inthis situation thepH
decrease will tend tooppose the exciting
stimulus. Without sufficient oxygen tomake
C02, agiven stimulus might cause excita-
tion and probability ofdeath. The insufficiency3
ofoxygen also leads toarelatively reduced state
ofthe cytoplasmic proteins, increasing their
electrical charge atagiven pH. C02 hasmany
other effects that act inthe same protective
direction, such ascalcium removal, iron
binding, and water binding, and these other
effects areatleast asimportant asthepHeffect.
(Badylak andBabbs, 1986 showed thatthecombi-
nation ofacalcium blocker and aniron chelator
with carbon dioxide tripled thesurvival after 7
minutes ofcardiac arrest.) Adequate C02 is
intimately involved inthedisposition ofcalcium,
and calcium's regulatory significance isuniver-
sally recognized.
K.P.Buteiko believed that increased carbon
dioxide inthe body fluids sometimes caused
cancers todisappear. Inmany studies over the
last40years (and thetrend can also beseen in
insurance statistics published in1912), itisclear
that cancer mortality ismuch lower athigh
altitude. Under allconditions studied, thecharac-
teristic lactic acid metabolism ofstress andcancer
issuppressed athigh altitude, asrespiration is
made more efficient. The Haldane effect shows
that carbon dioxide retention isincreased athigh
altitude.
Studying athletes atsea level and athigh
altitude, itwas seen that less lactic acid is
produced bymaximal exercise athigh altitude
than atsea level. Since oxygen deficiency in
itself tends tocause theformation oflactic acid,
this has been called the"lactate paradox"; the
expectation was that more lactic acid would be
formed, yetless was produced. Something was
turning off the production of lactic acid.
Normally, itisoxidative respiration that turns off
glycolysis and lactic acid production, sothat in
exercise beyond theability ofthebody todeliver
oxygen, and incancer with itsrespiratory defect,
glycolysis produces lactic acid. So,something is
happening athigh altitude which turns off
glycolysis.
The Haldane effect isaterm forthe fact
that hemoglobin gives upoxygen inthepresence
ofcarbon dioxide, andreleases carbon dioxide in
thepresence ofoxygen. Itistheincreased reten-
tion ofcarbon dioxide that accounts for the
"lactate paradox." Carbon dioxide activates theKrebs cycle, but italso combines with
ammonium, and indoing so,deactivates glycoly-
sisbecause ammonium activates aregulatory
enzyme. Athigh elevation, carbon dioxide is
retained, and lactic acid formation issuppressed.
(This iscalled the Pasteur effect, but altitude
physiologists haven't begun thinking inthese
directions.) Comparing very low altitude (Jordan
valley, over 1000 feet below sea level) with
moderate altitUde (620 meters above sealevel),
ACTH was increased inrunners after arace only
atthelow altitude, indicating that the stress
reaction was prevented byamoderate increase
ofaltitude. (el-Migdadi, etaI.,1996.)
The perspective wegetoncancer, from the
high altitude studies, allows ustogobeyond the
specific issue ofcancer, tothemore general issue
ofstress andregeneration. Inoutline, stress alters
thephysical nature ofthecellular substance ina
way that activates thecell, inwhich case itwill
either die from exhaustion, orgrow into new
cells. The replacement ofinjured cells means
that mutations need not accumulate, and this
renewal with elimination ofmutant cells hasbeen
observed insun-damaged skin. Among themany
layers offornl-generating and forol-sustaining
systems, thebalance ofelectrical fields has a
basic place.
Several investigators have demonstrated that
internal cancers altered the external electrical
polarity oftheanimal, increasing the negative
polarity inaregion near thetumor. Inthelate
1960s, Isuspected that irritation orinflammation
created aninjury potential, similar tothe"demar-
cation potential" ofacutnerve ormuscle. I
covered one arm sothat asmall spot would
sunburn without exposing thesurrounding skin,
and inother spots Iapplied small amounts of
prostaglandins, the "hormones" derived from
unsaturated fatty acids. The sunburned area was
distinctly negative relative toadjacent areas, and
some oftheprostaglandins (pGF, forexample)
produced aslight increase ofnegative charge. I
think these changes reflect both intensified
metabolism andincreased pHcaused byinterfer-
ingwith efficient cell.metabolism. Lac:tic acid
7production raises thepH, and high pHincreases
theionization ofmost proteins.
The localized distortion oftheelectrical fields
will participate inadjustments that should tend to
restore thenonnal fields, with different processes
occurring depending onhow long thedistortion
continues. Ordinarily, the fields change in
concerted ways during the rhythmic events of
eating, excreting, breathing, andsleeping.
When astate ofexcitement persists long
enough forthecelltoproduce anexcess oflactic
acid, causing ittobecome more strongly charged
electrically, nearby blood vessels and nerves will
tend togrow into the area, restoring normal
energy supply andintegrated functioning. (Lactic
acid can be demonstrated tostimulate vascular
growth byputting itnear theeye's cornea, causing
blood vessels toinvade previously clear areas In
cellculture, McCaig demonstrated thatnerve cells
grow toward thenegative electrode.)
When acdl hasbeen damaged (asbyradia-
tion ortoxins), itsinefficiency creates asmall
localized distortion inthe fields, which will
stimulate processes ofrepair orremoval and
replacement, asfarastheorganism's resources
allow. When astress isgreat enough that the
entire organism isexposed tolactic acid, the
organism's adaptive resources are being
challenged, and potentially harmful responses are
evoked. Forexample, asluggish liver canallow
the blood lactate concentration torise during
stress, and thIScanlead tosecretion ofendorphins
and pituitary hormones (Elias, etaI.,1997). The
endorphins can increase Jistamine release, and
growth hormone increases free fatty acids;
increased permeability ofblood vessels canallow
proteins and fats toleave theblood stream with
cumulatively harmful effects.
Ingeneral, the factors that protect against
harmful local activation ofcells arealso protec-
tiveagainst maladaptive general responses.
The doctrines that explain aging, cancer, and
other diseases interms ofthe"wearing outof
cells" have been based onthedenial oftheroleof
organismic patterns andfields intheregulation of
events onthe cellular and molecular levels.
Those theories ordoctrines have been popular
because they titthe"reductionist" idea ofscience,which tries toexplain theorganism asawhole in
terms ofitssmallest parts. The investigation of
regeoeration, which requires thinking interms of
patterns and fields, has been retarded bythat
essentially antibiological culture ofreductionism.
Sodium and carbon dioxide areessential for
maintaining the nonnal fields, and these
substances interact inways that cause both of
them tobelostduring stress. Inhypothyroidism,
sodium ispersistently lost, ascarbon dioxide is.
chronically replaced bylactic acid.
Both sodium (Veech, etal.; Garrahan and
Glynn) and carbon dioxide--by stimulating the
Krebs cycle, andkeeping therespiratory enzymes
active--help tomaintain thenonnal level ofATP,
protecting against stress andshock.
The interlocking fundamental features ofcell
excitation/relaxation, electrical potential, lactic
acid/carbon dioxide, water retention/water loss,
salt regulation, pHand energy level, allow usto
visualize inacoherent way the biological
meaning ofstress and adaptation. Interacting
with those physical-chemical events, there are
many layers ofbiochemical and physiological
processes that reinforce ormodify them, includ-
ing regulatory systems such ashonnones and
other biological signaling substances, nutritional
adequacy, and thetype offuel used. The. safest
and most effective interventions will bethose
which support our basic. organizational fields
(sodium, carbon dioxide, balanced proteins,
fruits, thyroid, pregnenolone, forexample), and
don't introduce distortions, assome drugs, foods,
hormones, andsupplements do.

Formany years after Warburg's classic work, itwas
generally assumed thattumors produced large amounts
oflactic acid andconsequently hadanacidic intracel-
lular pHi. However, with the advent ofMagnetic
Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), anon-invasive in
vivo measure oftissue pH became available and
demonstrated that· inboth human and animal
tumors, pHi was higher (>7.0) than pHepsilon «
6.8), incontrast tonormal tissues (e.g., liver) in
which pHi (approximately 7.2) islower than pH
epsilon (approximately 7.4). This result has been
confirmed inanimal tumors using anMRS-visible
extracellular marker, 3-aminopropyl phosphonate. The
pHgradient across thetumor cellmembrane ispartof
aninterrelated system ofionic gradients andmeasure-
ments made byboth 31P MRS and byconventional
analysis inMorris hepatoma 9618a and inlivers
demonstrated that thefollowing ions also·' changed:
compared with liver theNa+ content was 2-fold higher,
K+was 20% lower, total Ca2+ was 8-fold higher (7.4
mumoVg wet wt) and total Pi2-fold higher (8.5
mumoVg wet wt), suggesting thepresence ofinsoluble
calcium phosphate, HC03- was lower, total Mg2+
was similar inboth tissues, butfree [Mg2+J (calcu-
lated bytwo different methods) was approximately
5-fold lower in the hepatoma, as was
[ATPJ/[ADP) [P(i)J. Because ofaninadequate blood
supply, tumors are often hypoxic with impaired
Krebs cycle activity, low [ATP)I[ADP) [P(i)) and
rely mainly' onglycolysis for energy. The rapid
production and subsequent export ofanionic
lactate-from thetumor ceU would beaccompanied
byH+. This would account forreversal oftheproton
gradient and activation oftheNa+fH+ exchange. The
elevated [Na+]i would decrease the Na+/Ca2+
exchange, which would intum tend tocause the
accumulation ofCa2+ (and P(i)). Such calcification is
avery common feature oftumor pathology. The data
indicate the change ingradient ofone ion (H+)
involves alterations inthelinked equilibria ofmany
ions and also ofenergy metabolites and offers new
insights into properties oftumors important both
diagnostically andtherapeutically.

paradoxical, and these phenomena have therefore

appears that the acclimatization-induced changes in

mechanisms: (1)adecrease inmaximum substrate flux

acclimatization, although effects ofchanges inperiph-

accumulation during exercise that have been reported
tooccur between lowlanders and highlanders, both

Notes:
[The living cell isdifferent from most other electri-
cally polarized materials inbeing able toadjust its
charge, itsaffinity forsmall molecules andions, anditsshape. During stimulation (and contraction ofa
muscle), thephase potential may momenta.-ily disap-
pear asproteins' affinity forpotassium., sodium, and
caleilim eha..,ge, butthesigma potential doesn't, a..d
may even increase slightly. The nature ofL1Cexcited
state isdifferent indifferent environments, for
example, athigh altitude orinthe presence of
increased carbon dioxide, muscles dou't contract as
fully, a..,d don't produce asmuch lactic' acid during
their maximal activity, asthey dolii,der conditions of
high o>.:ygen andlowcarbon dioxide pressure.)
[Increased carbon dioxide lowers the so-called
membrane potential (Ling and Gerard, 1949), which I
interpret asbeing almost equivalent toalowering of
the"injury potential." There areseveral more direct
indications that carbon dioxide protects against
destructive excitation. Muscle contraction islimited
byincreased carbon dioxide, and athigh altitude,
maxiol1uill exertion islj,uited, very probably because
ofthe Haldane effect, inwhifh carbon dioxide is
retained inproportion totheoxygen deficit.
Carbon dioxide increases theassociation ofwater
"';th pruteins, aprocess analogous tolowering the
temperature; both cold and high C02 concentrations
have asimilar effect onmuscle relaxation a.r"'ter
contraction. (Howell, 1920)
Adeficieney ofcarbon dioxide (asinhyperventila-
tion) tends tocause epileptic seizures and muscle
cramps, and isafactor inasthma and several other
diseases (Buteiko) which seem toinvolve excessive
cellular excitation. Ithink itacts byway ofreducing
the overall electrical charge ofproteins, probably
acting asa"cardinal adsorbant," inGilbert Ling's
sense-a molecule which, when bound toaprotein,
changes theprotein's affmity forother molecules.}
[When aneedle ispoked into acell, itobviously
injures the cell, but the doctrine ofthe "plaSma
membrane" leads people todeny that what they are
measw'ing isatype of"injury potential." They want to
saythat they aremeasuring adisequilibrium between
theinside ofthecell and theoutside. (Adisequilib-
riunl has tobemaintained bysome charging mecha-
nism such asa"pump. ") They talk about the
sign.ificance ofthe"membrane potential" asifthe
presence oftheelectrode hardly had aneffect onthe
cell. And theswface (orsigma) potential always
seems tobeforgotten bythese people, who think of
iheouh,;de ofthecellas"positive. ")I
