Inflammation, adaptation,
and aging
For 100 years, schools and universities have
taught that inflammation is an essential and benignpart of our immune system, and until recentlyleading medical schools were teaching that inflam-mation implies infection, explicitly claiming that ifthere is inflammation, a biological pathogen mustbe present. If the 20th century contemporary alter-native view of inflammation itself as a pathologi-cal response that doesn’t necessarily indicate thepresence of pathogenic organisms was mentioned,it was virulently rejected as unscientific nonsense.In recent years, this alternative view has beenslowly moving into the mainstream, while theunfounded dogmatic official view of inflammationis quietly disappearing from research publications.There are, however, powerful forces in societycommitted to the old view.
For example, when news reports have
described the painful inflammation many peopleexperience following a vaccination, drug companyagents have responded “that’s good, it means thevaccine is working.” (Actually, the immediateinflammatory reaction is usually caused by anadjuvant; any specific reaction to the antigenicmaterial develops more subtly.) 
The doctrine that inflammation is a necessary
part of immunity, leading to destruction of thepathogen, affects the way diseases are treated. Inthe case of sickness associated with corona virusinfection, all attention is being given to stoppingthe multiplication of the virus, and all of the effec-tive anti-inflammatory treatments have beendisparaged. The fraudulent Lancet article lastspring on hydroxychloroquine, with coordinated
FDA action, was intended to discourage theempirical treatment of symptoms, in support of thegovernment-pharmaceutical campaign to vacci-nate everyone in the world. (Recently, a Lancetarticle reporting that supplemental vitamin Dreduced covid mortality by 60% was retracted bythe editors.)
It is the habits and manner of life
and the conditions in which itsancestors lived that have in thecourse of time fashioned its bodilyform, its organs and qualities.”

The ACE2 enzyme, which is one of our basic
means of reducing inflammation, is widely seen asthe door through which the virus enters cells, andtherefore as something to be blocked to protectagainst the virus. The virus can enter cells thatlack the ACE2 enzyme (Hojyo, et al., 2020), butthe important facts are that cellular inflammationpromotes viral replication, and that the ACE2enzyme prevents inflammation. Poor nutrition,aging, and other stresses weaken our antiinflam-matory defenses, leading to chronic systemicinflammation, and preexisting inflammationfavors viral replication, allowing the virus’s toxicspike protein to dangerously interfere with ournatural antiinflammatory system; the consequencecan be the “cytokine storm” and multiple organfailure.

Not for republication without written permission.attributed to it, and can have such a destructive
role in aging and stress, why do we have genes forthe factors that contribute to inflammatoryreactions? Biologists usually say that any traitfound in an organism is the result of natural selec-tion, and the presumption is  that it has been benefi-
cial at some time in our history. This presumptiontends to support the complex stories that textbookstell about the role of inflammation in disease andimmunity.   
In the 1940s, Barbara McClin-
tock discovered that plants understress can move their genes aroundto improve adaptation by producingmore variation in the offspring.
There is a very large feature of all vertebrates
and at least some invertebrates and plants thatrelates to the question of immunity and viral infec-tion. After the completion of the Human GenomeProject, it was discovered that our “genes,” theDNA that codes for proteins, make up only 2 to3% of our DNA, and that 8% of our DNA hasfeatures showing that it represents the essentialgenes for producing retroviruses, and that another40% of our DNA also represents sequencescharacteristic of retroviruses. This DNA has beencalled the genomic dark matter. A large part of itconsists of mobile genetic elements, transposons.
In the 1940s, Barbara McClintock discovered
that plants under stress can move their genesaround to improve adaptation by producing morevariation in the offspring.  Rather than admit thatMcClintock had discovered an aspect of thecreativity of life, they felt that the adaptive flexi-bility she had discovered was intolerably alien totheir mechanistic understanding of life.
McClintock’s recognition of stress-induced
genetic adaptability was completely unacceptableto the dogmatic genetic determinism that wasfirmly in control of the research establishment, soshe became almost invisible for 30 years, until thegenetic engineering industry revived her work,with great publicity and prizes, so that they couldclaim that their genetically modified organismswere no different from the organisms that
modified their own genes. 
It has been discovered that McClintock’s
“jumping genes” come from the “viral” part of ourDNA, but this information hasn’t led to a generalreconsideration of whether their origin is reallyviral. Rather, the main effect has been to darkenthe reputation of these agents of adaptive change.On the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (formerhome of the eugenics movement) website there isthe statement “Half of your genome started out asan infection; if left unchecked, some parts of it canturn deadly all over again.” As with inflammation,our intrinsic nature is given the blame for some ofour worst problems.
These parallels aren’t just trivial coincidences,
they have been created in line with a consistentideology of control, by a few very powerfulorganizations. Denial that the conditions of lifeare relevant to health has been their main theme,from the eugenics movement in the last century tothe current fraudulent information about viraldiseases. 
According to the doctrine of natural selection,
changes in organisms occur randomly, andenvironmental conditions allow some of thoserandom variants to thrive, while it eliminates theunfit individuals. This ideology justified steriliza-tion or euthanasia of those judged to be unfit, andit has used state power to suppress, not only theLamarckian epigenetic idea that better conditionscould be assimilated by the organism and itsdescendants, but also many of the efforts to elimi-nate disease by improving nutrition and eliminat-ing poverty.
A simple shift of perspective can solve some
old puzzles, such as how millions of species ofviruses came to exist, since viruses can’t repro-duce themselves without the organisms theyinfect, and why our cells would retain such animmense amount of useless or harmful DNA, ifour DNA has evolved by the elimination of theparts that didn’t contribute to fitness. McClin-tock’s work has led to an answer to thosequestions, as well as a basis for understanding theintelligence of epigenetics and the inheritance ofadaptations. The dark DNA functions duringembryonic development, mediating effects of theintrauterine environment on the expression of the2structural and regulatory proteins making up the
organism. There is no reason to think of it asuseless, and this means that there is no reason tobelieve that any of it originated as an infectivedisease. 
Denial that the conditions of life
are relevant to health has been theirmain theme, from the eugenicsmovement in the last century to thecurrent fraudulent informationabout viral diseases. 
      The study of exosomes, the particles the size of
small viruses, which transmit useful (or harmful)information between cells, has revealed theirsimilarity to the particles of DNA that bacteria useto transfer new information, such as resistance toantibiotics, to other bacteria. The exosome parti-cles can carry the DNA of mobile geneticelements, and as they leave the body in its secre-tions, including sweat and saliva, they can carrygenetic information to other individuals of thesame species, or to very different types oforganism.
The genetic dogma has insisted that our DNA
works like a computer with “read onlymemory”—information flows from DNA to RNAand from RNA to proteins, but never in the reversedirection. The existence of reverse transcriptase inhuman cells shows that the dogma was wrong inthe case of copying the information of RNA toDNA. James Shapiro’s work with bacteria showsthat they—supposedly one of the simplest organ-isms—have a read-write genome, and by under-standing their situation, are able to modify theirgenes to adapt to problem situations. It’s increas-ingly obvious that we have abilities similar tobacteria, with the dark DNA being part of thisadaptive system.
The basic outlines of our human form and
functions come into existence during gestation, ina very controlled environment. The sequentialappearance of many different kinds of cellarranged in different patterns requires the interac-tions of cells with each other and with theirsurroundings. In responding to their changingconditions, cells are secreting regulatory proteins,
cytokines, under the guiding influence of thetransposons (Deverman and Patterson, 2009;Jachowicz, et al., 2017; Nishihara, 2019, 2020),controlling the expression of proteins of special-ized cell structures and metabolism. 
The healthy mother’s physiology, interacting
with her environment, is constantly adjusting theintrauterine conditions, regulating temperature,providing oxygen and sugar, regulating carbondioxide level and essential nutrients while exclud-ing major toxins. The course of the baby’s devel-opment can be disturbed if the mother is malnour-ished or poisoned or experiencing inflammation,as from an infection, chronic stress, or vaccina-tions. A failure of energy, caused by hypoglyce-mia or interference with the use of oxygen, stopsthe formative developmental processes, and theconstructive actions of the cytokines can becomedestructive, causing inflammation, probablyaccounting for a large portion of birth defects(Yockey and Iwasaki, 2018). 
The course of the baby’s develop-
ment can be disturbed if the motheris malnourished or poisoned orexperiencing inflammation, as froman infection, chronic stress, orvaccinations.
     In the well controlled gestational c onditions, a
local tissue injury can heal without leaving a scar(Olutoye, et al., 1996). Later in life, depending onthe person’s conditions of life, and on the extentto which some of the intrauterine conditions havebeen preserved, a similar injury might healquickly with minimal scarring, or it might fail toheal, or it might produce massive scarring. Thecytokines, and their regulating non-coding DNA,have varying effects, depending on whether thereis sufficient energy to continue their preferredcourse of development, or whether stressful condi-tions demand the radical changes that can destabi-lize the chromosomes, leading development in avery different direction, that might produceoffspring more suitable to the hostileenvironment. 3Prolonged exposure to environmental condi-
tions that are far from the perfect conditions ofhealthy gestation results in a systemic inflamma-tory state, and this chronic inflammation leads tothe degenerative processes of aging, with a failureof the tissue restorative processes. 
The loss of stem cells, and the accumulation of
senescent cells that should have been replacedfrom the stem cell reserve, is a general feature ofaging, though tissues differ in the rate of stem cellloss, according to their special stresses. Intrauter-ine conditions, including low oxygen and highcarbon dioxide, are ideal for the functioning ofstem cells, and in the mature individual, stem cellsare maintained in areas with lower oxygenpressure. (Ivanovic, et al., 2004; Jeanne, et al.,2009; Hammoud, et al., 2012; Vlaski, et al.,2014),  Bone marrow is a tissue with a generallylow oxygen content, and it provides a continuingsupply of new cells that circulate to other tissues.In cell (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) cultureexperiments, growth under 20% oxygen, similar tothe atmosphere, caused rapid aging, while growingunder 3% oxygen the cells didn’t senesce. At 1%oxygen, stem cells don’t divide, while at 3% theydivide without losing their stem cell properties.
When cells are respiring vigorously, all of the
oxygen reaching the mitochondria is immediatelyused, so the oxygen concentration near the respira-tory enzymes is close to zero. If something inter-feres with the mitochondrial oxygen consumption(for example lack of thyroid hormone or thepresence of too much polyunsaturated fat, or nitricoxide, or carbon monoxide), the local oxygenconcentration increases, because it isn’t beingused. The hypoxic and quiescent stem cells areactivated by the local increase of oxygen, andbegin dividing and differentiating. If the damagedcells are removed, stem cells can replace them;otherwise, experiencing the conditions interferingwith efficient oxygen use, they will tend toproduce a tumor. 
A failure of efficient oxidative energy leads to
an increase of inefficient glycolysis, and the rapiduse of glucose creates a local deficiency ofglucose, activating the formation of the growthfactor VEGF which stimulates the formation ofnew blood vessels (Park, et al., 2001; Dantz, et al.,2002). The retina of the eye normally experiencesa low oxygen environment; an excessive amount
of oxygen, such as the treatment given prematurebabies, produces inflammation and stimulates theformation of new blood vessels, and often causesblindness. Caffeine, which can restore respiratoryenergy production (for example by inhibitingnitric oxide formation), inhibits the formation ofVEGF and consequently inhibits neovasculariza-tion and prevents the retinopathy of prematurity.In other tissues, similar effects of caffeine caninhibit cancer growth.
As chronic inflammation progresses
to fibrosis and loss of normal tissuefunctions, the conditions of stressincrease the likelihood that the trans-posable elements will be activatedincreasing chromosomal instability andphysiological malfunctions.
     The premature baby, suddenly leaving its low
oxygen, high CO2, sugar rich environment, andexperiencing the extreme new environment of ahospital incubator, is an extreme example of theway that our normal adaptive reactions canbecome destructive when misdirected by anunfavorable environment. The normal person,living many years in an environment with limitedamounts of the most supportive factors, andvarying amounts of many harmful factors, experi-ences a gradual accumulation of the tissuechanges that are produced by the misdirectedadaptive factors. Cytokines that were constructiveunder the conditions of gestation, becomepro-inflammatory, profibrotic, and harmful in avariety of ways, for example promoting theneovascularization of age-related macular degen-eration or of rosacea or of tumor growth.
In childhood and maturity, vigorous oxidative
metabolism can maintain some of the essentialprotective factors of gestation, including adequatelevels of glucose and carbon dioxide, goodtemperature regulation, and avoiding over-production of superoxide and lactate. In theseconditions, the cytokines can contribute to adapta-tion and continuing development. As inhibitors ofoxidative metabolism such as polyunsaturated fats4accumulate in the tissues, the dominance of protec-
tive factors decreases, and the cytokines becomemore likely to produce inflammation. 
As chronic inflammation progresses to fibrosis
and loss of normal tissue functions, the conditionsof stress increase the likelihood that the transpos-able elements will be activated (Andrenacci, et al.,2020), increasing chromosomal instability andphysiological malfunctions.
Many years ago Gaetan Jasmin (1956, 1968)
showed that low blood glucose intensifies abnor-mal inflammatory reactions, and that increasingblood glucose minimizes dangerous anaphylactoidreactions. It’s the oxidation of glucose (producingcarbon dioxide), which is favored by warmth andthe right amount of insulin, that can preventinflammation (Razavi Nematollahi, et al., 2009;Gogitidze, et al., 2010; Dandona, et al., 2010;Wright, et al., 2010). Too much insulin causeshypoglycemia, promoting inflammation; diabeticswho suffer nocturnal asthma attacks can solve theproblem by reducing the bedtime dose of insulin.Nocturnal asthma has been prevented by having anighttime glass of milk or other snack to sustainblood sugar (Caplin, 1976.)  
Regular exercise is often recommended for
decreasing chronic inflammation, despite the factthat prolonged strong muscle contraction producesinflammatory cytokines. It turns out that theincreased temperature produced by muscle activityhas antiinflammatory effects that outweigh theeffects of the contraction-induced cytokine. Simplykeeping the body temperature up can provide thosebenefits of exercise (Hoekstra, et al., 2020), aslong as the level of glucose is maintained. 
The role of our endogenous DNA mobile
elements in stress, aging, and inflammation, andtheir structural similarity to viruses, suggests thatsubstances that are helpful for stress-inducedinflammation could be helpful for viral infections,and vice versa. All of the effective treatments forCovid-19 have had antiinflammatoryeffects—angiotensin blockers, cinanserin (aserotonin blocker), antihistamines, naringenin,hesperidin, fisetin and other flavonoids (Clementi,et al., 2021; Bellavite and Donzelli, 2020; Mishra,et al., 2020; Jo, et al., 2020), progesterone(Jakovac, 2020), and calcium channel blockers(Solaimanzadeh, 2020; Jayaseelan VP and
Paramasivam, 2020). 
These substances reduce intracellular calcium
and increase carbon dioxide in relation to oxygenand lactate, with the effect of reducing randomand meaningless excitation and activation oftissues, making energy available for purposefulorganized activities of the organism.
