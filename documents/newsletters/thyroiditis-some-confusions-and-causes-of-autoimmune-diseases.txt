Thyroiditis. Some confusions
and causes of"autoimmune
diseases"
Girls' thyroid glands usually enlarge during
puberty, and inpregnancy it'sentirely normal for
thegland toenlarge and tobecome more active.
Eighty years ago, when iodine deficiency wasmore
common intheUS and Europe, theidea ofa
"colloid goiter" was common. Incertain regions,
many people hadenlarged thyroids thatcontained a
large amount ofcolloid--colloid isthe viscous
protein (thyroglobulin) solution formed mtiny
compartments inthethyroid gland, which canbe
broken down by"digestive" (proteolytic) enzymes
ofthecells that have secreted it,forming the
thyroid hormones, and allowing them tobe
released into theblood stream. The hormones are
formed astheaccumulated protein isbroken down;
thehormone itself isn't stored inthegland.
The reason fortheenlargement ofthegland
during puberty andinpregnancy, andduring some
kinds ofstress, isthat thecolloid isformed faster
than itisdigested bythethyroid gland andsecreted
into theblood. Ifsomething, such asanexcess of
estrogen, isblocking theproduction ofthethyroid
hormone, thegland islikely toenlarge, because the
pituitary secretes more thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH) when there isadeficiency of
thyroid hormone.
In vitro experiments show that estrogen
activates theformation ofthecolloid, butinhibits
itsbreakdown into thehormones. Progesterone, on
theother hand, activates theprocess ofproteolytic
digestion andsoincreases therelease ofhormones
from thegland, decreasing theaccumulation ofthe
colloid.
Therefore, when progesterone isdeficient or
estrogen ispresent inexcess, thecolloid tends to
accumulate (even tothepoint ofcausing avisibleInjury tothethyroid appai"ently precedes the

isevidence that tissue injury precedes the
appearance of"autoantibodies" inother condi-
tions, too.
Many people with metabolic problems,
including hypothyroidism, are being told that
they have "agenetic disease." This belief encour-
ages both physicians and their customers to
commit themselves toinappropriate treatments,
and tomisinterpret theresults oftests.
Eating seaweed orother foods orsupple-
ments containing iodine cancause both hypothy-
roidism and thyroiditis. The iodate sometimes
used asanoxidizing agent inbreads have proba-
blycontributed tothyroid disease intheindus-
trialized countries.
Dental x-rays, which can cause cancer ofthe
thyroid, brain, and eye, certainly have increased
theincidence ofthyroiditis and hypothyroidism.
The radioactive isotopes that areoften foolishly
used for supposedly '''diagnostic'' purposes
probably contribute totheincidence and severity
ofhypothyroidism and thyroiditis.
Besides iodine, radioactive isotopes, and
x-rays, other environmental toxins, including
mercury and dioxins can cause thyroiditis, but
diet and estrogens are probably the causes of
most thyroid problems.
Ageneralized inflammatory state, rather
than specific "autoimmunity," isresponsible for
thyroiditis and other "autoimmune
degenerative" diseases.
A"respiratory defect" isbehind theinflam-
matory condition.
Correcting athyroid deficiency tends to
gradually normalize theantibodies.
enlargement ofthegland, a"colloid goiter"), at
thesame time thattheperson may behypothyroid,
because thehormone isn't being released from the
stored colloid, into theblood stream. But, largely
because noonewants tosuggest that estrogen can
bepathogenic, anenlarged thyroid gland isnow
likely tobediagnosed as"Hashimoto's thyroiditis"
(orHashimoto's struma, orgoiter, ordisease).
Hashimoto's disease isclearly defined asthe
infiltration of the gland with lymphocytes,
"causing destruction" ofthegland's active tissue
and leading tohypothyroidism. The only way to
know that the gland isbeing invaded bylarge
numbers oflymphocytes isbybiopsy, but the
condition is normally diagnosed by pure
guesswork, without any biopsy. Sometimes
"antithyroid antibodies" found inthe blood are
used todiagnose Hashimoto's disease, but the
presence ofthose antibodies intheblood doesn't
mean that they originated inthethyroid gland, and
even though they have very specific names (e.g.,
"antithyroglobulin," "antithyroperoxidase") related
tothethyroid gland, they aren't even specific for
the thyroid gland. Ithas been suggested that
similarities inmolecular structure between thyro-
globulin and connective tissue proteins could
account forthefinding of"antithyroid antibodies"
more frequently inrheumatoid arthritis and
Sjogren's syndrome than in Hashimoto's
disease and Graves' disease (Ruggeri, etaI,
2002).
Inthelast 60years, most ofestrogen's toxic
effects have been hushed upbythedrug industry,
and estrogen's central antirespiratory and antithy-
roid actions areunknown tomost contemporary
endocrinologists. But endocrinologists often do
know that estrogen causes thethymus gland to
atrophy, and that thethymus gland isintimately
involved inmaintaining normal immune functions.
The degenerating thymus gland undergoes
invasion bylymphocytes and thereplacement of
active tissue byfibrous tissue, under theinfluence
ofestrogen orstress. The process ofcellular
invasion inthethyroid gland probably develops
more slowly than thatinthethymus, because estro-
gen's effect onthethymus isvery rapid.
The cells that make upthe thymus are
extremely varied, butalarge portion ofthem are
able tophagocytize other cells. This self-
phagocytosis probably contributes tothegland's
ability toshrink with such great rapidity. When
other organs aredamaged, theremoval ofdebris2
canbedelayed fordays, asphagocytic cells gradu-
allyenter thetissues from theblood stream.
Hypothyroidism isanimportant cause of
thymic atrophy, and a thyroid supplement can
stimulate regeneration ofthethymus.
This correction ofthethymic portion ofthe
"immune system" bythe thyroid hormone is
probably involved inthe observation that the
"antithyroid" autoantibodies decrease under the
influence ofsupplemental thyroid hormone, but
thesupplement also affects thethyroid gland, by
decreasing thethyroid stimulating hormone, TSH.
Excess production of TSH causes an
inflammation-like stress, that contributes tothe
production ofthecolloid goiter andeventually to
disordered structural changes inthethyroid gland.
Amore efficient production and use ofthyro-
globulin will decrease thetendency oftheover-
stimulated gland toproduce adefective globulin
that isantigenic.
So,rather than ignoring thefrequency ofthe
simple colloid goiter and calling everything
"Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroiditis," ifwelook
atthemechanisms involved intheproduction of
autoantibodies, wewill tend tosee"thyroiditis"
as,usually, thelaststage inthedevelopment ofa
simple colloid goiter. The autoantibodies, ina
healthy person, areprobably part ofacorrective
repair process, rather than asimply pathogenic
factor.
There isan almost obligatory. medical
genuflection toward "genetic causation" of
disease, andespecially ofthyroid disease, autoim-
mune disease, and other chronic ordegenerative
diseases. The fact that thyroid disease and
autoimmune diseases arefrom five totentimes
more frequent inwomen than inmen somehow
hasn't increased medical interest inthepatho-
genic role ofestrogen, and itdoesn't prevent
platoons ofmedical researchers from making
claims tohave discovered "which chromosome
carries thedisease."
This medical bias means that even thephysi-
cians who recognize that hypothyroidism isa
condition thatshould becorrected arenotlikely to
believe thatitisimportant tomodify thetreatment
according tochanges inthepatient's condition.
Many doctors assume that aperson never recovers
Part oftheproblem, Lewontin points out, isthe
casual way inwhich geneticistsÂ· speak. "This isseen
even inthenaming ofgenes," henotes. "Geneticists
speak casually ofthe 'gene for white eyes', butof
course, there isnosuch gene. There isavariety of
genes whose reading bythecellisproximally involved
intheproduction ofeyepigment and itsdeposition in
theeyecells." Hepoints outthat genes aresaid tobe

from thyroiditis, buttheevidence isclear that
simply giving supplementary thyroid usually
gradually corrects theproblem. Ifother protective
measures aretaken, recovery will bequicker and
more complete. When thedietisoptimal, theTSH
islikely tobe"abnormally low," below 1.0onthe
standard scale, even without use ofathyroid
supplement. Keeping thelevel ofTSH lowcontrib-
utestothereduction ofthegeneralized inflamma-
tory state that characterizes hypothyroidism and
autoimmunity. TSH should beconsidered tobeone
ofthe stress-related pro-inflammatory anti-
respiratory hormones, along with serotonin, hista-
mine, estrogen, parathyroid hormone, and
prolactin.
Thedietshould berelatively freeofantithyroid
foods, especially legumes andpolyunsaturated fats,
and thefoods ofthecabbage family, such as
broccoli, should bewell cooked, andused nomore
often than once aweek. The polyunsaturated fats
interfere with thethyroid hormone, disturb the
thymus andother immune functions, andincrease
theantigenicity oftissues.
Ahigh protein diet, ofabout 100 grams of
good protein daily, isprotective, and protein
deficiency isacommon cause ofhypothyroidism.
But too much emphasis onthemuscle meats,
including fish fillets, chicken breast orlegs, and
theusual steaks andchops, canbeantithyroid by
providing toomuch tryptophan. That canbeoffset
byusing gelatin liberally (chicken soup andox-tail
soup contain lotsofgelatin from thebones and
connective tissues), because gelatin contains no
tryptophan. Whey, which issold asaprotein
supplement, and egg whites contain too much3
tryptophan, and can beantithyroid ifused
excessively.
Using large amounts ofseaweed cancause
hypothyroidism andcaninjure thethyroid cells,
contributing tothyroiditis. Seaweed and other
iodine-containing food supplements areoften sold
toimprove thyroid function, butthey usually have
theopposite effect. Aniodine deficiency used to
cause goiters insome regions, butinthelast50
years most people intheUSandEurope have been
getting anexcessive amount ofiodine.
"We canrecall when aTSH of7.0orbelow was
considered normal. Years later, theTSH cutoff
was 6.4, meaning that anything below that level
was considered normal. Still later, thecutoff was
moved to5.5. Now, some labs are reporting a
lever of4.2asbeing thecutoff level, above which
thepatient may behypothyroid." "...atourclinic,
aTSH over 3isconsidered suspicious ...."(p.75)
"Some doctors prefer the lower limit ofa
corrected TSH tobe1.0.Others arecomfortable
with aTSH of0.5.Some thyroid specialists atthe
Universtiy ofCalifornia Medical Center inSan
Francisco like toseethecorrected level around
0.2(slightly below thenormal range of0.4-5.0) ..
That figure isgenerally considered bymany
nonuniversity doctors tobetoolow, suggesting to
them that the patient isontoomuch thyroid
medication.
"Atourclinic, wehave patients who donotfeel
well until they take enough medication tolower
their TSH level to0.1." (page 79)R.L. Shames
andK.H. Shames, Thyroid Power, 2001.
Endotoxin orother material absorbed from
intestinal bacteria contributes toavariety of
autoimmune problems, including thyroiditis
(Penhale and Young, 1988). Combining an
indigestible fiber, such asraw carrot, with mild
germicides, such asvinegar andcoconut oil,can
improve thehormonal environment, while reduc-
ingtheimmunological burden.
Adequate light isanother important factor in
maintaining ahigh energy respiratory state and
preventing thewhole complex ofinflammatory,
autoimmune, degenerative diseases.

abnormality manifested after habitual ingestion ofseaweed.
Okamura K,Inoue K,Omae T."An interesting case ofiodide
induced goitre with immunological abnormalities isdescribed. The
patient who was sensitive tosynthetic penicillin had previously
been treated forexudative pleuritis, congestive heart failure and
acute renal failure. Following recovery, hebegan toingest large
amounts of seaweed after which he developed goitrous
hypothyroidism. Itwas ofinterest that the serum level of
gamma-globulin increased, and subsequently the antithyroid6
microsomal antibody became strongly positive, suggesting that
thyroidal autoimmune processes had been precipitated. Biopsy of
the thyroid gland revealed chronic thyroiditis, with....
suggesting extreme stimulation byTSH." "While there isevidence
suggesting that increased iodide may beanimportant factor inthe
initiation ofHashimoto's thyroiditis, this may result from the
marked increased sensitivity ofHashimoto's gland totheeffects of
iodine."

association between familial AD and thyroid autoimmune disease,
theexpression pattern and cellular processing ofAPP inhuman

demonstrated that APP isoforms 770 and 751 were expressed in
fresh thyroid extracts aswell asincultured thyroid epithelial cells,
with APP 770 being thepredominant form. Compared toother
types ofcells, such aslymphocytes and fibroblasts, thyroid7
epithelial cells produced larger amounts ofAPP." "Interestingly,
thyroid epithelial cells also contained larger C-terminal APP
fragments of21, 35,and 41kDa. From thesizes ofthese fragments
itcould bededuced that they contained theentire amyloid beta
sequence and were thus potentially amyloidogenic. The 41-kDa
fragment was unique tothyroid cells. These fragments may be
released into the circulation after thyroid cell damage.

induce alterations inthyroid epithelial cells andcelldamage, and

fatigued and control groups. Toevaluate clinical relevance of
positive invitro findings, the replacement ofamalgam with

Takasu, IKomiya, YNagasawa, TAsawa, TShinoda, TAizawa,
and YKoizumi. "We determined the frequency with which
thyrotropin-blocking antibodies were present in172 hypothyroid
patients with goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease)
and 64hypothyroid patients with atrophic autoimmune thyroiditis
(idiopathic primary hypothyroidism). For 6toIIyears wethen
followed 21ofthese patients who were found tohave thyrotropin-
blocking antibodies. They received levothyroxine therapy for3.5to
8years, after which itwas discontinued." "Thyrotropin-blocking
antibodies were detected in9percent ofthe patients with
goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis and in25percent ofthose with
atrophic autoimmune thyroiditis. Among the21patients studied
serially while receiving levothyroxine, thyrotropin-blocking
antibodies disappeared in15(group I),7ofwhom had goiter
initially, and persisted in6(group 2),none ofwhom had goiter
initially. Levothyroxine therapy was subsequently discontinued in
these 21patients. Six ofthose ingroup I(four with goiter)
remained euthyroid (mean follow-up after discontinuation of
therapy, 2.1years), and nine became hypothyroid again within 3
months. All six patients ingroup 2remained hypothyroid.
CONCLUSIONS. Hypothyroidism insome patients with autoim-
mune thyroiditis may bedue tothyrotropin-blocking antibodies.
The production ofthyrotropin-blocking antibodies may subside,
producing remissions ofhypothyroidism. Chronic autoimmune
thyroiditis may therefore cause transient aswell aspermanent
hypothyroidism."
