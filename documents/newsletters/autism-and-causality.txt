Autism and Causality
The incidence of diagnosed autism increased
about 30 percent in a recent two year period in theUnited States, according to the Centers forDisease Control. In the last 75 years, there hasbeen about a 50-fold increase.  Although themeaning of the word has changed over time,increasing its diagnostic application, there isgeneral agreement that certain types of symptomhave become more common. It is just one of manyhealth problems that are increasing, despite theapparent growth of knowledge in biology andmedicine. Valid knowledge of its causes, leadingto ways to prevent and cure it, is likely to be appli-cable to other conditions.  
The only normal people are the
ones you don't know very well.  
                                    Alfred Adler
Early in the 20th century, Eugen Bleuler used
the term “autism” to refer to a withdrawn, uncom-municative type of schizophrenia: “The mostsevere schizophrenics, who have no more contactwith the outside world, live in a world of their own. . . . This detachment from reality with the relativeand absolute predominance of the inner life, weterm autism.” He clearly explained the idea of aspectrum of contact with reality, with evenrelatively normal people sometimes being more orless selective in the amount of reality they allowedinto their awareness.      
With rational objectivity at one extreme, and a
pathologically uncommunicative introversion atthe other extreme, Bleuler’s approach was bothempirical and analytical, and avoided rigidcategorization. However, in 1919 he published a
book,  Autistic and undisciplined thinking in
medicine, and how to overcome it.  For 20 years,
that use of the word probably made doctors inwestern Europe less likely to use the term indiagnosing the problems of children, but inMoscow in 1925, a child psychiatrist, GrunyaSukhareva, published the first study of autisticchildren. Her article describing the "autistic(pathological avoidant) psychopathy" waspublished in German a year later.
In 1938, Leo Kanner in the US, and Hans
Asperger in Vienna, began using the term todescribe the children they were studying, and theypublished articles on their work in 1943 and 1944,respectively. Kanner had a list of 20 traits thatwere common in his group of 11 children.Although he sometimes referred to autism as“inborn,” he described the condition that typicallywas noticed in the child’s second or third year,and he believed that the emotional regression ofthe child was caused by the emotional coldness ofthe parents, especially the mother. He consideredthe condition to be very rare, occurring about onceper 2500 children. 
Autism is just one of many health
problems that are increasing, despitethe apparent growth of knowledge in
biology and medicine.
Hans Asperger wasn’t ambivalent about the
hereditary nature of the conditions that hedescribed. His attention was on older children, andhis definition of autism was similar toSukhareva’s. He emphasized that the specializedabilities of some of his patients could be sociallyRay Peat's Newsletter

but he believed that the majority were sociallyworthless, and he referred them to a “hospital” thatspecialized in euthanasia. There has beensome embarrassment about his Nazi activitiesamong diagnosticians, leading to the official disap-pearance of the “Asperger’s syndrome,” but somecountries have declared his birthday to be Interna-tional Asperger Day, and some of those in theautism culture are arguing that Asperger was thetrue “discoverer” of the syndrome, and that Kannerstole his ideas. Kanner, who helped to relocate 200jewish refugees to the US, was undoubtedly awareof Asperger’s involve- ment with the Nazi system,and as a result probably considered his work not tobe scientifically valid.
Bruno Bettelheim, a proponent of Freud’s
psychoanalytic doctrine, popularized Kanner’s“refrigerator mother” idea, and by the early 1950sstories in the major US news magazines had madethe public aware of the idea that neglected babiessometimes developed emotional problems and oddbehaviors such as repetitive movements and avoid-ance of touching.  
The doctrine of genetic determin-
ism has historically had severalfunctions; an important one has beento justify the inability of medicine tocure diseases such as cancer, diabetes,
and schizophrenia . . .
In 1964 Bernard Rimland wrote a book reject-
ing that “psychogenic” theory, arguing for a“biological” cause. Rimland had an autistic son,and he (following observations of Kanner andAsperger) suggested that “intellectually superior,”introverted, highly educated parents were morelikely to have autistic children because of contrib-uting a genetic vulnerability directly related tointelligence. He suggested that the reticularactivating system in the brain stem was likely tobe the part of the brain responsible for autism.Although it was generally believed that diseasescaused by genetic defects were incurable, Rimlandwas aware of Abram Hoffer’s success in treatingschizophrenia with niacin. Hoffer was followingLinus Pauling’s orthomolecular principle, in
which a genetic malfunction could be corrected byproviding increased amounts of the metabolite thatwas lacking as a result of a defective gene.Rimland organized studies, using B vitamins andmagnesium, demonstrating improvement in themajority of the treated children, and cures insome.
The orthomolecular doctrine was inspired by
Roger J. Williams’ demonstrations of thebiochemical uniqueness of each rat or person,which suggested that each individual mightrequire a slightly different environment to developproperly and to stay healthy. Williams’ researchwas in the interaction of nutrition with the individ-ual’s genetic makeup. It was committed to geneticdeterminism, but it provided some loopholes, ascientific rationale for considering that“innate diseases” such as autism might be curable.
The doctrine of genetic determinism has
historically had several functions; an importantone has been to justify the inability of medicine tocure diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and schizo-phrenia, but it’s also an ideology, with strongpolitical and “philosophical” implications, includ-ing eugenics. When Bernie Rimland said thatautism had a genetic cause, and that it wasn’t theresult of bad parenting, his book becameextremely popular with the parents of autistickids, and that popularity was reinforced by themedical determinists, and also by the eugenicsadvocates. When Rimland’s book was published,several states still had laws permitting forcedsterilization of undesirable people. More than 50years later, there are well known autism research-ers who virulently attack workers in the field whodefend the psychogenic view, or who don’t fullysupport the view that autism is inborn and deter-mined by genes. Medical opinion was muchless enthusiastic about his studies of nutritionaltherapy. Later, when he reported on the associa-tion of a vaccine with autism, comments in themedical journals were mostly negative.
Although the major medical journals gave the
impression that Rimland’s book had ended seriouswork on the “psychogenic” factors in autism, therehave been several well known dissenting psychia-trists. Peter Breggin has said that the changedatmosphere following Rimland’s publication was2produced by political pressure from parents, rather
than by valid evidence. Frances Tustin wrote that“There is persistent denial by American society ofthe causes of damage to millions of children whoare thus traumatized and brain damaged as aconsequence of cruel treatment by parents who areotherwise too busy to love and care for theirbabies.” A study of adopted Romanian babiesconfirmed the observations of many people inprevious decades that the impersonal treatment inorphanages damages many of the children.
Genetic determinists have been
arguing that the twin effect is an effectof genes, but for that to be a validargument, it would be necessary toshow that sharing a placenta does notconstitute having a very similarenvironment during the development
of identical twins . .
 . 
The reaction of the medical profession to
Rimland’s interest in nutrition and vaccinationshowed that their understanding of “biological”and “genetic” determination was more extremethan his. Rimland, at least when I knew him in the1980s, was distinctly uninterested in the possiblecausative or therapeutic roles of hormones, despitehis recognition that certain aspects of the environ-ment could be causative and therapeutic. Hiscritics were committed to the eugenicist’s view ofbiology and inheritance—if it’s in the genes, it’sincurable, and since our body is an expression ofthe genes, harsh environments don’t affect ourconstitution unless they cause genetic mutations.
Some people are arguing that autism is 80%
determined by genes, similar to the older argumentabout the heritability of intelligence. Twin studieshave been used to make this argument—identicaltwins are more concordant for autism than frater-nal twins, who are more concordant than siblingsin general (Bohm, Stewart, Healy, 2013). Geneticdeterminists have been arguing that the twin effectis an effect of genes, but for that to be a validargument, it would be necessary to show thatsharing a placenta does not constitute having avery similar environment during the developmentof identical twins, or that sharing a uterus
during the development of fraternal twins isn’thaving a more similar environment than siblingswho are gestated singly. 
The ferocity with which the genetic determi-
nists have attacked even the limited recognition ofenvironmental effects on fetal development, or theeffects of nutrition on brai n function, or the effects
of exposure to toxins and antigens on health andpersonality, isn’t the result of a mere “scientificdisagreement.” Their blindness to evidence iscaused by the way their brains developed, underthe influence of their environments. They recog-nize that their entire sense of themselves, and theirtheory of being, is challenged by those who showthat our present and future are more than effects ofthe inherited past.
Charles Darwin recognized the absurdity of
believing that random changes could everconstruct the complexity of an organism, so heproposed that “gemmules,” formed in the variousparts of the body as they adapted to their environ-ment, entered the germ cells to affect the nextgeneration.  Even though that theory didn’tinclude a role for Lamarckian striving guiding theadaptations, it was completely rejected byso-called Darwinists (because it implied thatthe organism wasn’t entirely a matter of its inher-ited past), until fairly recently, when “epigenetic”influences started to be recognized. To theneodarwinists, epigenetic changes are only tempo-rary and superficial, but they could neverthelessaccount for developmental causation of autism, orof variations in mental ability. But the develop-mental process isn’t a matter of passive accumula-tion of new traits, any more than it is a passiveunrolling of old traits.   
Experimental embryology made it clear that
development is an intentional process. An embryocan survive extreme disturbances, by adjusting itsstructures and metabolism, but those adjustmentsto difficult intrauterine conditions can sometimesmake adaptations during childhood problematic.At each moment of an embr yo’s development, it is
absorbing nutrients and becoming something morethan it had been. Its needs will vary depending onwhat it becomes. If the materials aren’t in balance,some of the constructive processes will slow, andproportions change. If glucose or oxygen is3deficient, or if another deficiency interferes with
their use, the structures that need less energy maycontinue to grow, while the structures with thegreatest need for energy may stop growing.In experiments, just changing the temperature ofthe uterus during gestation changed the length oflegs in proportion to the body. The proportions ofthe different parts of the brain are, like the rest ofthe body, dependent on the unique developmentalconditions of the individual. The nervous systemparticipates in the development of all of the tissuesin the body during gestation, and at birth the exter-nal senses introduce powerful new developmentalsignals. At birth, the baby is experiencing andadapting to touches, odors, sights, and sounds, andthese either satisfy or frustrate its needs. 
These processes of revision are
continuous, from the parents’gametes through fetal developmentand childhood into maturity. Atany stage, an abundance ofresources can restore a moreexpansive trajectory of develop-ment.  
From the moment of conception, and before,
adversity leaves impressions in the form of DNAmethylation and histone acetylation; the organismrevises itself based on experience, anticipating thatthe future might be similarly stressful. Theseprocesses of revision are continuous, from theparents’ gametes through fetal development andchildhood into maturity. At any stage, anabundance of resources can restore a more expan-sive trajectory of development.  
Ashley Montagu, in his book Touching: The
Human Significance of the Skin,  argued that the
newborn’s skin contact with the mother was anessential factor in the development of the mind andbody. “It is through body contact with the motherthat the child makes its first contact with theworld, through which he is enfolded in a newdimension of experience, the experience of theworld of the other.” Common medical practicesthat interfere with immediate and continuous skincontact are known to increase the risk of
autism—for example, cesarian section delivery,use of anesthetic, bottle formula or intravenousfeeding. In both animals and humans, touchingcauses epigenetic changes in DNA (Löken, et al.,2009; Loke, et al., 2015; Lippmann, et al., 2007;Lee, et al., 2007; Laudenslager, et al., 1995).Nurture is an essential part of Nature. 
In the US, about 10% of babies are premature,
and receive special hospital attention. In manyhospitals, even full term babies are routinelyseparated from the mother except for breastfeeding. The interrupted ski n contact isn’t the only
risk in a hospital. In the first minutes, a newbornrecognizes the pattern of a face, and prefers tolook at it, rather than at other patterns. In the firstday, babies prefer an image of their mother’s faceover that of a stranger; they learn to identify aface with only a brief glimpse (Walton, et al.,1992, 1998). Newborn humans and monkeysprefer to look at face images of their own species.The pleasure they get from seeing their mother’sface undoubtedly reinforces the pleasure ofcontinuous skin contact.
All animals that have faces use “eye contact”
in emotional communication, and it seems thatquick recognition of individuals by their face is ageneral animal ability.  The innate need to see themother’s face is paralleled by an innate ability tomimic—a smile elicits a smile. All animals use“body language” to communicate—when a facialexpression or gesture or stance is perceived, theability to mimic means that the feeling behind thegesture is simultaneously perceived. This aware-ness of intention isn’t limited by species; forexample, a dog responds to a goat’s threateningpose. Cats, being aware of this intelligence in theirprey, sometimes assume an exaggeratedly noncha-lant manner, to overcome the wariness of theirintended victim.
One of the ways that autism has been
described is that it involves the lack of a “theoryof mind,” that is, a recognition that other peoplehave a separate consciousness and emotions. Thisis sometimes called mind blindness, or emotionblindness. When I was in graduate school, apsychology professor told me that the reasonbabies don’t need anesthesia during surgery isthat, before myelination in their brain is complete4around the age of 18 months, they don’t
experience pain. A biology professor said that wecan’t know that animals experience pain becausethey can’t speak. Many years before that, SigmundFreud had written that without language, there isno consciousness. In the US in the 1990s, a surveyfound that the great majority of circumcisions wereperformed without any anesthetic; the usual expla-nation was either that it didn’t cause pain, or if itdid, the baby didn’t remember it. I always under-stood that my professors, and a large proportion ofthe medical and scientific professions, sufferedfrom some sort of mental defect, but I didn’t havea name for it. Now I understand that it is a form ofautism, mind blindness. Without a recognition ofanother’s mind, there can be no empathy. 
Touch is ten times stronger than
verbal or emotional contact, and itaffects damn near everything we do.    
                                   Ashley Montagu
It used to be common for doctors to tell new
mothers that babies shouldn’t be picked upwhenever they cried, and nursery workers are stilloften instructed to minimize physical contact withthe babies, and formula feeding, with earlyweaning, has been promoted by most doctors, andis still the rule in the US and several othercountries.   Several studies have shown a declinein the empathy of medical students in their third
year, when they begin taking care of patients ;
the stress of excessively long hours of work isprobably a factor. Studies of beginning collegestudents have shown much lower empathy levels(or at least an increased willingness to expresstheir lack of empathy) than in previousgenerations, suggesting that something is happen-ing in the culture to make a lack of empathy moresocially acceptable. By many of the accepteddefinitions of autism, the medical professionfosters autism, and our general culture isbecoming more autistic.
In the family of defining features of
autism—mind blindness, communicativedifficulty, lack of eye contact, avoidance of physi-cal contact with people, repetitive movements,narrow interests, reduced understanding of the
continuing succession of events—there is acommon factor, namely, inflexibility. Thebrain has an extremely high metabolic rate, usingenergy to adapt to the constant inflow of sensoryinformation from the body and its surroundings.To the extent that it lacks energy, it reduces andsimplifies. With full energy, it builds a continuingmodel of itself and the things it interacts with,each of which is a process. In a state of deficientmental energy, things become categories ratherthan processes, and they don’t occupy a place inan ongoing life story. Understanding the differ-ence between cause and effect is an energeticprocess; waiting, expecting, and planning requirethe maintenance of a complexly flowing model ofthe situation. There is evidence of defectiveenergy metabolism in autistic children (Vallée andVallée, 2018; Chugani, et al., 1999; van der Sloot,et al., 2017).
Many things are involved in the brain’s
energetic process, and the rate of chemicalreactions is one factor. Increasing the brain’stemperature can improve its functioning. Severalstudies have confirmed parents’ observations thata fever improves symptoms in autistic children.“Results revealed fewer autistic-like behaviors forchildren with  fever compared to controls, withmore than 80 percent of fever subjects  showingsome behavioral improvements andapproximately 30 percent  exhibiting dramaticimprovements.” (Goldstein, 2007; Curran, 2007;Taylor, 2016.)
Practically every structure in the brain has
been studied as “the location of the defect” inautism. The cerebellum, the prefrontal cortex, thereticular formation, the anterior cingulate system,nucleus accumbens, nucleus tractus solitarius,thalamus, amygdala, insula, auditory cortex, olfac-tory cortex, visual cortex, etc., have been found tohave a different function or structure in autisticand normal brains. The degree of over-concreteness in autism research is similar to thatin cancer and heart disease research, and it revealsthe autistic quality of mainstream science. In 1946Abraham Maslow distinguished two approaches tothe practice of science, one guided by methodsand means, another guided by a consideration ofthe importance of solving problems; if you have a5hammer, everything looks like a nail. Context
blindness is a common feature of science andautism. 
When we ask what man wants of
life, we deal with his very essence. 
                                     A. Maslow
Things in the environment, or substances
produced in reactions to environmental stress, thatmight cause autism, include prenatal and neonatalexposure to radiation, including isotopes from thepower industry, bomb testing, Chernobyl, andFukushima; exposure to air pollution, includingnitrogen oxides, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfurdioxide, and particles (Jung, et al., 2013); alumi-num (Mold, et al., 2018), lead, mercury, manga-nese, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, manganese,and nickel (Windham, et al., 2006);acetaminophen, infections, endotoxin, exogenousand endogenous estrogens, hypothyroidism,progesterone deficiency, agmatine deficiency,serotonin excess, endogenous nitric oxide(Sweeten, et al., 2004), and vitamin D deficiency.All these have established associations with therisk of autism. 
When energy is deficient, cells are susceptible
to damage from normal levels of stimulation.Restraining excitatory reactions is at least protec-tive, and it often improves functioning. Anti-excitotoxic substances include progesterone,memantine, minocycline, and agmatine. A highratio of CO2 to lactate, reducing intracellular pH,is important for preventing excessive excitability.Thyroid hormone, besides directly increasingenergy and the CO2/lactate ratio, tends to increasethe brain’s temperature, and to increase the ratio ofprogesterone to estrogen.
An environmental factor which has increased
parallel to the autism epidemic, and which contrib-utes to brain swelling, inflammation, reducedenergy production, increased excitability, oxida-tive damage and undesirable shifts in hormones, isthe use of polyunsaturated fats as food. Peoplewith autism have been found to have abnormallyhigh levels of prostaglandin, isoprostanes, andleukotrienes, which are associated with lipidperoxidation and brain inflammation (El-Ansary
and Al-Ayadhi, 2012; Ming, et al., 2005). VitaminD has a broad range of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions that probably contribute toits therapeutic effects in autism (BaSalamah , etal., 2018; van der Sloot, et al., 2017; Cannell,2008, 2017; Saad, et al., 2016).
If nature is essentially interactive, interde-
pendent, ecological, and organismic, nurturing isan essential part of nature. When science is funda-mentally mistaken about the nature of causalityand being, it will be problem blind, and mostlyineffective in dealing with issues such as autism.Jose Ortega y Gasset’s famous statement isrelevant for both science and autism: “I am I andmy circumstance; if I don't save it, I don't savemyself.”
