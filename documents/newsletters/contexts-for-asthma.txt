Contexts forasthma
Asthma inchildren involves many ofthe
biological processes that cause disability and
degeneration intheprocess ofaging, andsince
theincidence ofasthma inchildren isincreas-
ing, ithas serious implications fortliewhole
population.
Increased exposure toestrogen (including
prenatal exposure), increased consumption of
unsaturated vegetable oils, useoffood ordrug
additives including guar gum, carob,
carrageenan, and sulfites, and the use of
adrenergic ("beta-agonist'') inhalant drugs
have coincided with theincreased death rates
from asthma. Estrogen and unsaturated fats
areclearly involved inproducing thesymptoms
ofasthma.
Living athigh altitude decreases asthma
prevalence and mortality. Exercise increases
theincidence ofasthma. These facts provide
insight into thebiochemical events ofasthma.
The inflammatory-excitatory processes of
asthma are parallel tothose ofdepression,
diabetes, premenstrual syndrome, arthritis,
migraine, MS, SLE, multiple organ failure,
aging, and death.
Protecting cellular energy andstability can
prevent oralleviate asthma. Thyroid, proges-
terone, and carbon dioxide aretherapeutically
useful, butreducing exposure topolyunsatu-
rated oils and estrogens should bethebasic
annrnach.
Medical theories ofasthma give abetter
insight into thenature ofmedicine than into
thenature oftheasthmatic condition.
Evasion andmisdirection were woven into the
culture ofpharmacology bythecompetition tosell
products. The obJective result hasbeen somethingapproaching genocide. The U.S. government has
served asthe agent ofthe drug industry, by
outlawing generic remedies whenever acorpora-
tion sought tofillthat niche with itsnewly
patented substance. This practice issofundamen-
talthat, when inquiry ismade about getting FDA
approval forasubstance, theresponse isthatyou
must first have apatent onthesubstance. Onits
face, thisindicates thattheagency isinaconspir-
acy against the public health, topermit only
proprietary remedies tobeused legally.
"Medical empiricism" traditionally referred to
theuse.ofremedies thatworked, without trying to
build aspeculative ortheoretical explanation for
the way they worked orforthephysiological
nature ofdisease. "Scientific medicine" decided to
callthatapproach quackery, andtobuild atheory
ofdisease that would explain how remedies
worked.
Asitworked out,thismeant thatcertain kinds
ofremedy were "validated" bycertain types of
theory. Commercial and cultural interests there-
fore fostered andpromoted thetheories that they
found most profitable. Impressively "scientific"
words were invoked tojustify procedures that
otherwise would have been considered barbaric.
Asmicroscopic technique developed, "humoral"
theories ofdisease were replaced bycellular
theories, andthecellular theories came toencom-
pass the"genetic" theories ofdisease.
The specific, concrete nature ofthe"gene"
concept became part ofthe"allopathic" tradition
ofmedicine, inwhich aspecific drug was appro-
priate for,"indicated" for,aspecific symptom or
disease. The holistic ideas associated with the
homeopathic tradition disappeared from organized
medicine intheUnited States. Afragmented and
compartmentalized "health science" hasbeen the
result.
Inthe17th century theterm diathesis (consti-
tutional predisposition) was coined to"explain"
disease, and theterm was replaced inthe20th
century bythephrase "genetic cause."
Medical writers (and medical editors) are
similar topoliticians and college sophomores in
their habitual useoftheclassical logical fallacies.
When students use defective reasoning, the
presumption isthat they areconfused, butwhen
politicians and physicians argue fallaciously, the
interpretation must include other possibilities.
Ifacertain theoretical explanation hasbecome
unnecessary and impossible, then agrowing
advocacy ofthat theory strongly implicates
ulterior motives, andsuggests corrupt influences.
.Although there were individuals who believed
that asthma was a"psychosomatic" disease orthe
result ofaninfection, theofficial medical position
hasbeen thatitisadiathesis, acongenital disposi-
tion, a"genetic disease" (e.g., Castro, etaI.,2001;
Ishikawa andTsujimoto, 2001). Agenetic theory
ofdisease isideal forthedrug business, since
incurability guarantees continuing sales. Fads in
asthma theory coincide with theavailability of
products. The defective genes have atvarious
times been thought toproduce excessive activity
intheparasympathetic nervous system, orinconti-
nent mast cells that leak histamine, orenzyme
defects that produce too much Slow-Reactive-
Substance orleukotriene, orweak adrenal glands,
orgenetic imbalances that affect the immune
system inrelatively simple orinmore complex
ways.
Sudden increases inasthma mortality inthe
1960s and 1970s invarious countries corre-
sponded toincreased use ofcertain synthetic
adrenergic drugs (instead ofadrenaline), called
bronchodilators, asinhalants. The concept that
they were "beta-agonists" was used torationalize
their use, even after animal experiments showed
that they caused serious heart damage, andother
harmful effects.
When themedical model ofasthma shifted its
emphasis from "smooth muscle spasm" to
"inflammation," ashift that intheU.S. dates from
aseries ofpublications inthe1980s (Ackerman,
1989), there was theusual sense ofaccomplish-
ment, asauthors andmedical professors spread the2
word about thelatest inhaled steroid products,
replacing the"synthetic adrenaline" inhalants that
had been increasingly used during theyears that
asthma mortality hadbeen rising sorapidly. That
this change ofmedication was thirty years tardy
wasn't mentioned. (G. Rona's group began
publishing warnings intheearly 1960s about the
heart and vascular damage caused byadrenergic
drugs such asisoproteronol.) Even asnew
medications came into use, there wasn't much
change inmedical knowledge about asthma. And
even though there isevidence that oraL gLucocor-
ticoids drastically reduce death from acute
asthma (Abramson, etaL., 2001), and that
inhaLed gLucocorticoids have serious systemic
side effects, the drug industry created another
set ofmystifications, claiming that inhaling
certain synthetic steroids wouLd act seLectiveLy
upon thebronchiaL tubes and Lungs.
AsfarasIcantell, theonly significant event
thatcaused thechange ofemphasis inthemedical
model ofasthma from "bronchial contraction" to
"bronchial inflammation" was thepromotion of
steroids toreplace the "bronchodilators." The
description ofthedisease seems tochange accord-
ingtothedrug that's being marketed.
Decades ago, thepublic accepted themedical
doctrine that asthma, and allergies ingeneral,
were caused bygenetic defects. With thetremen-
dous increase inthedeath rate from asthma in
recent decades (coinciding with similar increases
inother supposedly "genetic" diseases), many
people arede-emphasizing thattheory, because an
impossibly high rateofmutation would have been
needed tocreate those "new genetic defects."
However, few people arelooking foraradically
new theory ofasthma.
Asthma would beagood place tomake afresh
start inunderstanding chronic disease, and the
first step hastobetoabandon theunfounded and
corrupt theory ofgenetic causation, and to begin
theconstruction ofafunctional, environmental
theory ofitscause. Ifasthma canbeunderstood
functionally, there isagood chance thatitcanbe
prevented orcured.
Elite athletes aregenerally considered tohave
"good genes," and exercise iscommonly said to
promote good health, soanew orientation is
needed toaccommodate the fact that "elite"
athletes, winter orsummer athletes, including
participants inthe Olympics, have a high
incidence ofasthma--roughly three times
higher than thegeneral population.
Itturns outthat exercise induces thesigns and
symptoms ofasthma, notonly in"asthmatics," but
innormal people too.
Anaerobic exercise (getting outofbreath)
increases therelease of,oractivity of,alarge
variety ofinflammatory mediators, beginning
with lactic acid and interleukin-6 released from
the exercised muscle itself, and including
factors released from various cells intheblood,
and hormones including estrogen, prolactin
and sometimes TSH.
Figures from Mexico show that, inthe
states with high altitude, the prevalence of
asthma isabout tentimes lower than thestates
that areclose tosealevel. Mountain therapy has
been used foralong time totreat asthma andother
chronic diseases, especially inRussia. Inthe
United States, many publications have confirmed
that high altitude alleviates asthma, butitiscalled
"antigen avoidance therapy," despite evidence that
shows improvement athigh altitude even inthe
presence oftheusual antigens, such asskin mites.
All ofthe main mediators ofinflammation
decrease with increasing altitude.
The incidence ofasthma ingirls surpasses that
inboys around puberty, and itiscommon for
asthma tobeworse premenstrually. The useof
oral contraceptives often makes asthma worse.
During pregnancy, asthma sometimes gets worse,
sometimes better. Atmenopause, asthma islikely
togetworse, andtoappear inwomen who didn't
previously suffer from asthma. The useofestro-
gen atmenopause increases the incidence of
asthma. Progesterone, and related hormones,
alleviate asthma, and this probably accounts for
thevariable effects ofpregnancy onasthma, since
pregnancy canimprove theratio ofprogesterone
toestrogen, butoften, with poor nutrition, estro-
gen dominance isexacerbated bypregnancy.
Estrogen exposure early inlifecancause asthma
later. The common useofDES during pregnancy
inthe1950s was oneofthefactors that caused the
increase ofasthma inchildren inthe1960s.3
Estrogen increases most ofthemediators of
inflammatiop, which aregenerally inhibited by
progesterone. Estrogen also shifts many processes
toward excitation, and it'soften hard todisting-
uish the mediators ofinflammation from the
mediators ofexcitation. Free polyunsaturated fatty
acids, forexample, which areincreased under the
influence ofestrogen (orexercise, diabetes, night-
time, aging, histamine, parasympathetic
dominance, etc.), produce both inflammation and
excitation. Associated with the processes of
inflammation and excitation isthetendency of
estrogen and other inflammatory mediators, such
asnitric oxide andserotonin, toimpair mitochon-
drial respiration. This effect onthecells' energy
production isprobably responsible formany of
thethings thatoccur inasthma, such asedema and
smooth muscle contraction. Acute orchronic
interference with mitochondrial respiration can
produce atremendous variety ofsymptoms,
depending onthelocation, and thedegree ofthe
energy deprivation. Exercise, probably acting
through some ofthesame mediators, also impairs
mitochondrial respiration.
These factors that impair respiration tend to
shift mitochondrial metabolism away from the
oxidation ofglucose andtheproduction ofcarbon
dioxide, totheoxidation offats and theproduc-
tionoflactic acid.
The clear distinction between inflammation
and excitation (and excitotoxicity) islargely an
artifact ofthe drug industry's influence on
medical theory.
The "spasmolytic" drugs that areintended to
prevent contraction ofthebronchioles cancause
histamine release aswell asincreasing cortisol
production, and they increase thelevel offree
fatty acids aswell asraising theblood sugar.
Simply shifting thecells' energy production
away from theoxidation ofglucose canproduce
excitability, inflammation, increased leakiness of
blood vessels, changes inmucus, discharge of
histamine andserotonin, hormonal changes, etc.
The doctrine of"preventing excessive weight
gain" inpregnancy that dominated obstetrics-
gynecology intheU.S. inthe1950s and 1960s
probably contributed totheincreased prevalence
ofasthma inthe'sixties and 'seventies, because
protein deficiency creates aninflammatory state,
andastate ofestrogen dominance. (Measurement
ofinflammatory proteins intheblood hasbeen
proposed asaway toconfirm protein deficiency.)
One ofthe major "acute phase proteins,"
C-reactive protein, isdefensive against bacteria
andparasites, butitissuspected tocontribute to
tissue degeneration. When itspresence isthe
result ofexercise, estrogen, ormalnutrition, then
itsassociation with asthma islikely tobecausal,
rather than coincidental.
Some ofthe"acute phase proteins" inthe
blood, that areassociated with inflammation, rise
progressively with aging, and areinduced by
estrogen. One ofthese stress-related proteins,
serum amyloid P-component, iscalled the"female
protein" in hamsters. This type ofprotein is
implicated inatherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease,
heart attacks, andkidney disease.
Therespiratory system issointimately related
tothecirculatory system and other systems that
thetraditional classification ofdiseases can be
misleading. Ordinarily, asthma isdistinguished
from bronchitis, emphysema, "Acute Respiratory
Distress Syndrome" or"shock lung," pulmonary
edema, surfactant deficiency, etc., asifeach
problem were clearly distinguishable byitsintrin-
sicproperties. Actually, there isconsiderable
overlap, andthediagnostic distinction candepend
onthepatient's history andsituation, rather than
ontheactual pathology. Even "High Altitude
Pulmonary Edema" hasimportant similarities to
"bronchial asthma."
Even though breathing might betheimmediate
focus ofattention, there isnohealth problem
which isn't systemic. The old medical useof
cathartics forasthma, epilepsy, headaches, arthri-
tis,cancer, etc., wasoften based ongood observa-
tion. Before medicine became "scientific," many
cases ofasthma and epilepsy were successfully
treated with vermifuges, but now therole of
parasites inthese conditions israrely considered.
The specific location ofsymptoms--bronchial
asthma, migraine, hemorrhoids, sneezing,
etc.--brought onbyanallergen, such asworms or
certain foods orconstipation orintestinal gas, is
influenced bynervous reflexes. Reflexes are
exaggerated bystresses such ashypoglycemia or4
alkalosis. Experimenters, forexample, found that
inflating aballoon intheintestine ofananesthe-
tized animal wouldn't produce any observable
reactions when theblood sugar was normal, but
when the blood sugar was lowered, broncho-
spasms orother localized reflexive reactions
would beproduced.
The allergic reaction produced by any
substance isintensified byhypoglycemia, and
weakened byelevated blood sugar. Decreasing or
increasing sodium has asimilar, but weaker,
effect. (G.Jasmin, 1968)
Knowing something about thesituation that
preceded abreathing difficulty can beuseful,
especially asaguide toeliminating environmental
problems, butthefact that somany conditions
involve the same physiological/pathological
components means that afew therapies can be
rationally used formany "different diseases."
For example, caffeine, thyroid, carbon
dioxide, progesterone, and several other anti-
serotonin drugs (e.g., tianeptine and
ketanserin) canbetherapeutic forasthma, even
when thespecific causes aren't known.
Buteiko's recognition oftheimportance of
carbon dioxide (and theavoidance ofhyperventi-
lation) intheprevention ofasthma isvalidated by
the fact that high altitude normally alleviates
asthma, that carbon dioxide inhalation athigh
altitude relieves altitude sickness (indicating that
altitude sickness, like asthma, istheresult of
relative hyperventilation), andthatacetazolamide,
which increases carbon dioxide retention andis
used toprevent ortreat high altitude sickness, also
alleviates asthma.
Practically everything which isstressful will
shift metabolism away from theadequate produc-
tionofcarbon dioxide. Theuseofoxygen supple-
mentation totreat asthma orother respiratory
difficulty without also supplementing carbon
dioxide isunphysiological anddangerous.
Inthe19th century intheU.S., cocaine was
officially recognized asatherapy forasthma, and
inSouth America coca isthetraditional remedy
foraltitude sickness, butthere hasbeen very little
scientific investigation ofthetherapeutic useof
cocaine. Itincreases progesterone production and
probably has antihistamine action. Atropine,
which isvery similar· inchemical structure to
cocaine, was astandard drug forasthma until the
synthetic antihistamines and bronchodilators
displaced it.Although it'sknown mainly asan
"anticholinergic," atropine canprotect against the
excessive liberation offree fatty acids that inter-
feres with the use ofglucose. Camphor,
amantadine, procaine andother soothing anticho-
linergics orantihistamines had asimilar fate, as
farasasthma therapy isconcerned. Theantihista-
mine Benadryl isusually helpful inasthma and
other inflammatory orspasmodic conditions.
Eucalyptus oil,containing cineole oreucalyp-
tol,isatraditional remedy forasthma, thatinhibits
theproducts ofunsaturated fatty acid metabolism
and thecytokines most associated with asthma
symptoms.
The uncontrolled release ofmany inflamma-
tory andexcitatory substances canbeprevented by
good nutrition, emphasizing adequate protein and
magnesium intake, and theuse ofsugars and
saturated fats, rather than starches andunsaturated
fats. Vitamin Eprotects against theinflammatory
actions oftheunsaturated fats. The short-chain
saturated fatty acids ofcoconut oilhave been
reported tohave antihistamine actions. The selec-
tion ofproteins should minimize the amino
acids tryptophan (which isthe precursor of
serotonin) and cysteine (which, like
tryptophan, suppresses thyroid function), by
including gelatin and fruits. Gelatin is22%
glycine, which protects thelungs andother organs
against toxins andinflammatory agents, andmany
fruits are also "deficient" intryptophan and
cysteine.
The overlapping effects ofestrogen, polyun-
saturated fats, exercise, serotonin, histamine,
lactic acid, nighttime, and hyperventilation, tend
tobecumulative andself-stimulating. Degenera-
tive changes intissues areaccelerated byallof
these stress mediators.
When these factors aren't corrected, the
standard officially recognized treatments for
asthma--despite theacute relief they canprovide--
will probably increase long-range morbidity and
mortality. Forshort-term relief, combinations of
safer materials can probably befound that will5
give thesame immediate results, while helping to
correct theunderlying problems.

Menopause, postmenopausal estrogen preparations, and the

prospectively evaluated theassociation ofhormone replacement
therapy and asthma incidence inacohort ofpre- and postmeno-
pausal women 34to68yrofage. During 582,135 person-years of
follow-up between 1980 and 1990, 726 new cases ofasthma
were documented. Postmenopausal women who were never
users ofreplacement hormones had asignificantly lower
age-adjusted risk ofasthma than premenopausal women
(relative risk =0.65; 95% confidence interval [Cl) =0.46 to
0.92). Among naturally menopausal women, the age-adjusted
relative riskofasthma forever useofpostmenopausal hormones
was 1.49 (95% CI=1.10to2.00); forcurrent useofhormones
(conjugated estrogens with orwithout progesterone), 1.50 (95% CI
=0.98 to2.30); andforpast use, 1.52 (95% CI=1.08 to2.13),
compared with never useofhormones. Ever users of10ormore
years' duration had twice the age-adjusted risk ofasthma
compared with women who never used postmenopausal
hormones (95% CI=1.39 to2.87). Among current users ofconju-
gated estrogens, there was apositive dose-response demon-
strated between daily dose and asthma risk (pfortrend =
0.007). While confirmatory studies arewarranted, these data
suggest that estrogen plays arole inthe pathophysiology of
asthma and that long-term useand/or high doses ofpostmeno-
pausal hormone therapy increase subsequent risk ofasthma.

mhvargas@mailer.main.conacyt.mx Motivated by the great
asthma-prevalence variation throughout theworld, weanalyzed
therate variation ofmedical services due toasthma inthe32
Mexican states attheInstituto Mexicano del Seguro Social
(approximately 24million insured subjects). In1993, atotal of
406,036 services were due toasthma, and state rates ranged
from 53to476x10,000 insured subjects. Adirect correlation (p
<0.05) was found forsingle-room house, ascariasis, andrubella
rates, but the strongest (inverse) correlation was found for
geographical altitude (r=-0.73, P<10(-5». Thus, inMexico,

Pediatr Allergy Immunol 1997 Nov;8(4):200-4. Isasthma an
endocrine disease? Wjst M,Dold S.The prevalence ofpediatric
asthma has increased inmany parts oftheworld. This increase
started more than 30years ago and isparticularly obvious in
studies which document theonset ofasthma innative populations
when they change toa"Western" lifestyle. Besides agenetic influ-
ence, numerous environmental factors have been described forthe
development ofasthma. Genetic factors are unlikely toexplain
thesharp increase within theshort time period and also aller-
gen and pollution exposure orany specific infection does not
actually seem tobethe main cause for this phenomenon.
Another factor, however, that fits well into thegeographical
and temporal background ofthe asthma epidemic isthe
mother's oral contraceptive use. Wetherefore review theepide-
miological association with later asthma inthechildren, give a
summary ofestrogen effects onimmune function and develop a
preliminary theory how oral contraception could influence later
pregnancy.

perusqui@servidor.unam.mx Weassessed thepossible inhibition
ofairway smooth muscle contraction byprogesterone and
pregnanolones (5alpha and 5beta-reduced). Progesterone and 5
beta-pregnanolone prevented histamine- orcarbachol-induced
contraction inisolated guinea-pig trachea and potency was
related totheir respective chemical structure; progesterone was
themost potent inhibitor inaconcentration-dependent manner.
The steroids also exhibited calcium antagonist activities inthis
tissue asassessed bytheir action oncalcium entry indepolarized
preparations; this event involved theimmediate blockade ofthe
extracellular calcium influx inthemuscle cellmembrane, indicat-
inganongenomic action. Classical GABAA antagonists didnot
block theprogesterone response, implying noinvolvement ofthe
GABAA-receptor complex. Our results suggest abronchodilating
effect induced bysexsteroids, and probably byother related
compounds, before the genomic mechanisms take place. This
nongenomic action ofsteroids could have potential therapeutic
usefulness inthetreatment ofasthma.

Asthma ismost commonly found inendurance events, such as
cycling, swimming, orlong-distance running. The riskofasthma is
especially increased among competitive swimmers, ofwhich 36%
to79% show bronchial hyperresponsiveness tomethacholine or
histamine. The riskofasthma isclosely associated with atopy and
itsseverity among athletes. Afewstudies have investigated occur-
rence ofexercise-induced bronchospasm among highly trained
athletes. The occurrences ofexercise-induced bronchospasm vary
from 3% to35% and depend ontesting environment, type of
exercise used, and athlete population tested. Mild eosinophilic
airway inflammation hasbeen shown toaffect elite swimmers and
cross-country skiers. This eosinophilic inflammation correlates
with clinical parameters (ie,exercise-induced bronchial symptoms
and bronchial hyperresponsiveness). Athletes commonly use

DP, Poulos A.Department ofImmunology, Women's and
Children's Hospital, Adelaide, Australia. Fish oils are
abundant inpolyunsaturated fatty acids ofthen-3series (in
particular eicosapentaenoic, 20:5 anddocosahexaenoic acid,
22:6). Such fatty acids aregenerally considered tobebenefi-
cial intheprevention. ofcardiac disease and tohave anti-
inflammatory properties. Neutrophil adherence isan
essential early event inanacute inflammatory response,
and we have demonstrated that both 20:5 and 22:6
stimulate adherence invitro. Arachidonic acid (20:4,
n-6) was also stimulatory. Significant simulation of
adherence was seen from 5to80microM (nontoxic
concentrations) 22:6, 20:5, or20:4. Atthelower fatty
acid concentrations tested «or=40microM) 20:5 was
less active than 22:6 or20:4 atstimulating adherence.
Above 40microM there was nodifference intheability
ofthethree fatty acids tostimulate adherence. Atthe
lower fatty acid concentrations tested «or=10microM)
22:6 was less active than 20:4, whereas above 10microM
they were equally active. Immunofluorescent flow cytomet-
ricanalysis ofneutrophil integrin (adherence) receptors
showed that thecomplement C3bi receptor (CDllb) was
up-regulated bythese fatty acids. There was nochange in
CDIIaorCD11c.Saturated fatty acids ofthesame chain
length were without effect onadherence orreceptor expres-
sion. The fmdings suggest that these polyunsaturated fatty
acids may, under certain conditions, beproinflammatory
with respect totheir acute effects ontheinteraction of
neutrophils with microbes, endothelium, and other
tissues.
