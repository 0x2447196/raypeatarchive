Lungs, shock, inflammation,
and aging
There isagrowing effort bythefood and
drug industries, and many physicians, to
promote theuseofcertain polyunsaturated
acids, those with their double bonds farthest
from theacidic endofthemolecule. These fats,
which arefound infish, algae, andmany vegeta-
bles, are the most easily oxidized ofthe
common fatty acids. With stress, such asprema-
ture birth, and with aging, these fats produce
free radical decomposition products atahigh
rate. They contribute to'"shock lung" and to
multiple organ failure.
After Ihad done my dissertation onthe
changes inoxygen metabolism that occur during
aging andunder theinfluence ofestrogen, andnot
long after Ihad seen thetherapeutic effects of
progesterone inepilepsy, arthritis, depression, and
multiple sclerosis, Imet awoman who was
disabled with some kind ofinflammatory muscle
andjoint disease. Herface, arms, andupper torso
were emaciated, but her hips and thighs were
huge. This pattern offatdistribution istypical of
theextreme andprolonged influence ofpstrogen.
Indiscussing herhealth history, shesaid that
hermovement problems began attheageof21,
when herphysician-father began giving, both her
andhermother regular injections ofestrogen.
Having adoctor inthefamily, they had the
most complex medical studies done intrying to
diagnose their problems. The thing that stood out
inherdescription ofthetests was thepulmonary
oxygen diffusion test, which shesaid showed that·
both she and hermother had oxygen diffusing
capacity that were "95% below normal." Ithink
shemight have meant thatthey were inthelowest
5percent ofthepopulation, since Ican't think ofanother interpretation that would becompatible
with life. Right around thattime, Iread astudy in
which mice were given alarge dose ofestrogen,
which, after just 40minutes, caused asimilarly
radical decrease illtheir oxygen diffusing
capacity.
Inthelate 1960s, Ihadbeen interested inthe
use byathletes ofadrink made byfoaming
oxygen into asolution ofgelatin, toincrease their
blood oxygenation andtheir performance. Itried
totalk toafew physician-researchers about this,
and they firmly said that itwas nonsensical,
because "blood isalways fully oxygenated when it
leaves thelungs." Looking inthescience library at
theuniversity, Ifound arecent (c.1968) study in
which the blood's oxygenation was found to
decline with aging, commonly down toabout
50%. But despite themouse study, Ididn't find
anystudies regarding estrogen's effects onoxygen
diffusion inhumans. Ibelieved that thereason
was thesame asthedenial that athlete's blood
might notbefully oxygenated, namely, astupefy-
ing degree ofauthoritarianism and aneed to
absolutize anything that was illamedical
textbook.
About 15years later, Ivisited afriend who
was 82years old, who lived inToluca, Mexico.
When Ifirst saw him, Icould seethat hedidn't
recognize me. Hewas sitting down, breathing
heavily, and hisface was purplish. Hehad been
diagnosed ashaving emphysema, andhadn't been
able towork forseveral weeks. Since hewas very
fat,Iguessed thathemight besuffering from the
"...atamaximum level ofexertion, the
heart athigh altitude isrelying lessonglyco-
lysis (anaerobic energy production), and
getting more ofitsenergy from oxygen, than
.itwould atsea level." This means that
sea-level metabolism ismore like cancer

<dioxide ratio. .
same sortofestrogen-provoked diffusion problem
thatIhadrunacross previously. Ilefthisdaughter
some progesterone andpregnenolone togive him,
and leftToluca forseveral days. The next time I
saw him, hisskin had abetter color, and his
humor hadreturned. When Icame back again two
weeks after hehadstarted taking progesterone and
pregnenolone, hiscolor was entirely normal, he
had resumed working inhisoffice (inabuilding
that didn't have anelevator), and heinsisted on
taking mearound thecity, causing metopant·
because ofthealtitude, about 8,500 feetabove sea
level.
Inthe1950s, Gilbert Ling found that, under
theinfluence ofincreased carbon dioxide, excit-
able cells don't "depolarize" electricallyl tothe
extent that they dounder anormal atmosphere.
This principle hasbeen applied totreat epilepsy,
bybreathing airwith afew percent ofcarbon
dioxide added, and more often, theprinciple has
been used inthe"diagnosis" ofepilepsy, byusing
hyperventilation toinduce seizures, bydisplacing
toomuch carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide sponta-
neously forms carbamino groups byreacting with
theamino groups inproteins, and increasing the
oxygen pressure causes thecarbon dioxide tobe
displaced.
The binding oftheacidic carbon dioxide tothe
protein molecule shifts electrons intheprotein,
making itmore acidic. This shift intheprotein
changes theway theprotein interacts with other
molecules, including water, sodium, potassium,
and calcium. Under therelatively acidic condi-
tions when carbon dioxide isabundant, with the
ceii proteins' average electrons slightly
"retracted," free radical production isinhibited,
andcells aremore resistant toradiation damage or
other excitatory damage.
Carbon dioxide, along with thecarbonic acid
itforms asitreacts with water, regulates the
organism's handling ofwater.
Carbon dioxide's association with cells has
many effects, including the regulation of
hormones and nerve transmitters. For example,2.'
carbon dioxide causes cells tobind serotonin, so
that aloss ofcarbon dioxide causes serotonin to
bereleased, with the effect that blood vessels
become more permeable, andleak fluid (including
serum proteins) intothesurrounding spaces.
Inthe lungs, this leakage offluid isvery
inconvenient.
Inanytissue, theleakage ofserum creates an
additional barrier tothediffusion ofoxygen from
theblood tothetissue cells. The hypoxic cells
release lactic acid and other mediators ofinflam-
mation, andthewalls ofthecapillaries andother
blood vessels thicken, making theproper circula-
tion oftheblood more difficult. These effects are
usually overlooked inthebrain andtheheart, but
inthelung they arehard tomiss. Following a
stressful death, thelungs arewaterlogged, with a
great increase inweight, acondition called "shock
lung" or"wet lung."
The antiexcitatory action ofcarbon dioxide is
opposed byoxygen, sooxygen can, inthis
context, beconsidered asacell excitatory agent.
At increased pressure, pure oxygen causes
seizures, and even atnormal pressure, thelungs
aremore likely tobedamaged when there ismore
oxygen. Since thelungs' delicate membranes are
indirect contact with air,it'sobvious thatthey are
inavulnerable situation, easily losing toomuch
carbon dioxide inthe presence ofexcessive
oxygen.
Athigh altitudes, once aperson hasadapted to
thelower oxygen pressure, thetissues retain more
carbon dioxide, andthisprevents cells from being
activated tothesame extent that's possible atlow
altitude, sothere isless lactic acid produced. The
carbon dioxide makes theblood circulate more
easily, sotheheart works less tocirculate the
blood atthesame rate that itwould circulate at
sealevel, oreven atahigher rate, and even ata
maximum level ofexertion, itisrelying lesson
glycolysis (anaerobic energy production), and
getting more ofitsenergy from oxygen, than it
would atsealevel.
IInthenormal resting state, acell is"polarized." Inthedepolarized state, acell isvulnerable, andifitistoo
frequently depolarized, itcanbedamaged orkilled intheprocess called "excitotoxicity," andother related degen-
erative processes. Cancer cells arechronically "depolarized," and this isrelated totheir low-efficiency
metabolism.
Some people, who have arespiratory problem
atsealevel, react tohigh altitude bybreathing so
hard that they lose even more carbon dioxide than
they were losing atlow altitude, and they may
develop lung edema, and even brain edema and
seizures. With lung edema, breathing becomes
harder, and theheart works harder. Ithasbeen
discovered repeatedly over theyears that altitude
sickness canbetreated successfully with supple-
mental carbon dioxide. The now-standard treat-
ment for mountain sickness isthe drug
acetazolamide, which causes thebody toretain
carbon dioxide. Despite the drug's success in
preventing andcuring altitude sickness, there isa
weird reluctance toacknowledge that mountain
sickness isproduced byaninsufficiency ofcarbon
dioxide. The same drug isnow often used totreat
sleep apnea, despite thetextbooks' opinion that
sleep apnea iscaused bytoomuch carbon dioxide,
rather than bythealkalosis resulting from insuffi-
cient carbon dioxide.
Ifwethink ofthepresence oflactic acid as
evidence ofmetabolic inefficiency, then an
athlete, oranyone who exercises strenuously, has
alowdegree ofefficiency, especially atsealevel.
Despite thepresence ofoxygen that isn't being
consumed atamaximum rate, glycolysis becomes
very intense, producing lactic acid that apparently
helps tolimit thefulluseoftheavailable oxygen.
Itisprobably thehigh oxygen pressure, wasting
carbon dioxide, that turns onthelower efficiency
lactic acid-producing glycolysis.
"Hypoxemia ofexercise," thefailure ofthe
blood tobefully oxygenated during strenuous
activity, isvery similar tothechronic hypoxemia
that occurs inthe"respiratory distress syndrome."
Women ahtletes have agreater tendency to
exercise hypoxemia then men. Intheluteal phase,
when progesterone should bedominant, women
breathe more effectively than during theestrogen-
dominated. follicular phase ofthe cycle. Since
estrogen, like exercise, causes blood vessels to
leak fluid, this isn't surprising. Stress, such as
exercise orsickness, causes asignificant rise of
estrogen, along with the other mediators of
inflammation, even inmen.
Both exercise and estrogen dominance cause
fatty acids tobeliberated from thetissues. The3
unsaturated fatty acids increase thepermeability
ofcapillaries, and theratio ofunsaturated fatty
acids tosaturated fatty acids corresponds closely
tothedegree oflung malfunction andrespiratory
distress. (Baughman, etaI., 1984) The medium
chain saturated triglycerides, extracted from
coconut oil,canbeused forintravenous feeding
without causing therespiratory distress and lung
damage produced bythe unsaturated vegetable
oilsthatwere formerly used.
The long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids,
including linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic, and
docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, cause mitochon-
drial breakdown, thyroid suppression, vascular
permeability, brain edema, andincreased radiation
sensitivity.
DHA isthemost unstable ofthese unsaturated
fatty acids. Butthere isatpresent avery poweful
marketing campaign which argues that DHA
should beadded tobaby formula and should be
taken byadults, because wesupposedly "evolved
onadietrich inn-3fatty acids," andbecause our
tissues generally contain amuch lower concentra-
tionofthen-3fatsthan ofthe n-6fats.
There isevidence that thelow ratio ofthese
n-3 fatty acids, such asDHA (docosohexaenoic
acid), tothen-6fats, such asarachidonic acid, is
theresult ofthefactthatthen-3fatsareextremely
unstable, and break down rapidly inthetissues,
producing lipid peroxides, free radicals, and the
characteristic ethane, which can bemeasured in
thebreath. Stress accelerates thedecomposition of
these fats, andtheresulting ethane canbedetected
inhigher amounts during respiratory distress, and
inpremature babies andinolder people.
Mead Johnson hasannounced that itwill add
DHA totheir baby formula, arguing that itisan
essential nutrient foreyeand brain development.
But animals that arefedadiet that is"deficient
in"DHA areless susceptible toeyedamage than
animals that have "sufficient" DHA. But more
generally, animals that aredeficient inallofthe
so-called "essential fatty acids" areextremely
resistant toall sorts ofinjury, shock, and
poisoning.
Since allofthepolyunsaturated fats inhibit
thyroid function, andsince thethyroid hormone is
essential forthedevelopment ofthebrain and
lungs, increased useofpolyunsaturated oils will
increase theincidence ofhypothyroidism, leading
tothebirth ofmore premature babies with lung
disease. With ahigh concentration ofpolyunsatu-
rated fats inthe lungs, the exposure ofthe
newborn's lungs tooxygen will create aninflam-
matory reaction. This isprobably why therespira-
tory distress ofprematurity usually takes afew
days toappear. Considering what isknown about
oxygen, lungs, and DBA, Ithink itwould be
reasonable tosay that increased use ofDBA
would betheideal way toincrease infant lung
disease.
Theunsaturated fatsandestrogen contribute to
theincreased release ofserotonin andnitric oxide
(NO). Nitric oxide isproduced during inflamma-
tion, and, likeethane, canbedetected inthebreath
when thelungs areinflamed. Nitric oxide, asa
pro-inflammatory free radical, stimulates the
peroxidation oftheunsaturated fats. Both NOand
serotonin inhibit mitochondrial respiration, shift-
ingmetabolism toward glycolysis.
Since theprocesses that damage thelungs are
sosimilar inaging, stress, andprematurity, Ithink
anexamination ofthefactors that cause premature
birth will beuseful forunderstanding thegeneral
problem of"lung stress."
Preeclampsia, orasyndrome ofpregnancy
induced hypertension, occurs inabout I0%of
pregnancies, andit'sthemain cause ofmaternal
death andsickness ofthenewborn.
Thomas Brewer, about 50years ago, made it
clear thataprotein deficiency isthemain cause of
preeclampsia. Protein deficiency causes ageneral
inflammatory condition, with increased serotonin:
Inwomen with preeclampsia, there areabnor-
mally high levels ofserotonin, nitric oxide, and
lipid peroxidation.
Inastudy ofmore than 3000 women (Clausen,
etal., 2001), the consumption ofsugar and
polyunsaturated fatwas strongly associated with
thedevelopment ofpreeclampsia. Women who
don't eatenough protein arelikely tosubstitute
sugar andfatfortheabsent protein, sothisstudy
isconsistent with Brewer's work, butit'svery
important toseethat itwas polyunsaturated fats,
notsaturated ormonounsaturated fats, thatcaused
the problem. Eclampsia (pregnancy- related4
seizures) and preeclampsia arecaused byoxida-
tive stress, produced bytheexcessive unstable
fats. The increased serotonin andnitric oxide are
exactly what would beexpected toresult from the
high consumption of polyunsaturated fats,
especially with adeficiency ofprotein inthediet.
Protein deficiency, like anexcess ofpolyun-
saturated fats, causes athyroid deficiency. Supple-
ments ofthyroid, given during gestation, acceler-
ate the maturation ofthe baby's lungs, and
prevent therespiratory distress syndrome.
The useofadequate protein andsaturated fats
during pregnancy will prevent many ofthe
problems ofpregnancy andinfancy, butsince the
unsaturated fats remain stored inthetissues for
many years, andaremobilized during stress, it's
important toeatcorrectly long before pregnancy.
The requirement forvitamin Eremains high for
years after thediethascontained anexcess ofthe
polyunsatured fats.
The diet which protects thedeveloping fetus
happens tobethedietthatprotects adults from all
sorts ofstress, and prevents many oftheworst
symptoms ofaging.
Supplemental thyroid, pregnenolone, and
progesterone canpartly make upfordefects inthe
diet, bymaintaining abetter balance between
carbon dioxide andlactic acid, andbyrestraining
the various mediators ofstress, such asNO,
serotonin, andestrogen.

Clausen T,Slott M,Solvoll K,Drevon CA, Vollset SE,
Henriksen T.OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia isassociated with
high body mass index, insulin resistance, andhypertriglyc-
eridemia. Our objective was toinvestigate prospectively
whether diet inthefirst halfofpregnancy isassociated with
therisk for preeclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: This prospec-
tive, population-based, cohort study ofpregnant women
investigated dietary intake early inthesecond trimester with
aquantitative food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: The
questionnaire was completed by3133 women (83%).
Preeclampsia developed in85women. Adjusted odds ratio
(95% CI) forpreeclampsia was 3.7(1.5-8.9) forenergy
intake of>3350 kcal/d compared with <or=2000 kcalld.
Adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) forpreeclampsia was 3.6
(1.3-9.8) forsucrose intake (percent oftotal energy) of
>25% compared with <or=8.5% and 2.6(1.3-5.4) for
polyunsaturated fatty acids intake (percent oft0tal energy)
of>7.5% compared with <or=5.2%. Other energy-
providing nutrients were notassociated with therisk for
preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: The current study suggests
that high intakes ofenergy, sucrose, and polyunsaturated
fatty acids independently increase therisk for preeclampsia.

ethane formation was investigated inratlung and liver
homogenates, incubated insealed flasks, inwhich the
peroxidation wasstimulated bytheaddition offerrous ions.
For both tissues, theproduction ofethane was maximal
under a20% oxygenated gasphase, while hyperoxic condi-
tions ledtoadecreased ethane inthegasphase. Theforma-
tionofthiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS),
another marker ofthelipid peroxidation process, inthe
homogenates oflung and liver wasstrongly stimulated at
100% compared to20% oxygen. Experiments were also
carried out oniron-stimulated peroxidation ofpure
docosanexaenoic acid preparations, which under airled
toalarge production ofethane. As for tissue
homogenates, theTBA-RS content was increased inthe
presence of100% oxygen. Those conditions, ho\¥ever, did
notinduce anincrease inethane production butledtothe
formation ofethanol. Therefore, thequenching ofethyl
radical bymolecular oxygen seems tobeavery attrac-
tive hypothesis toexplain thelack ofincreased ethane
production infavor ofethanol when iron-induced lipid
peroxidation wasstimulated byoxygen.

[Administration ofglucocorticosteroids topremature

Neonatal glucocorticosteroid therapy isincreasingly
being used fortheprevention ofchronic lung disease in
very premature infants. Intheshort term thistherapy is
usually successful. There is, however, increasing
evidence forlong-term adverse effects. Inparticular
there seems tobeanincreased chance ofabnormal brain
development, which later results inlocomotory dysfunc-
tion, developmental delay andcerebral palsy. From experi-
mental studies there areindications thatcardiovascular and
immunological complications may occur during adult life.
Long-term follow-up ofneonates treated· with glucocorticos-
teroids seems warranted sothat adverse effects that may
occur later can bedetected and where possible treated.
Moreover, thedevelopment ofalternative treatments should
be considered such asthe use of less potent
glucocorticosteroids.
