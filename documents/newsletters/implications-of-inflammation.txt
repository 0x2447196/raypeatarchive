Explanations were considered tolack "objectivity"
ifthey related toapurpose; students were taught
toavoid "teleological" explanations, ifthey wanted
tobereal scientists. However, from tnetime of
Pasteur andtheadoption ofmass vaccination, the
body's reactions toalien material were concretized
intheconcept ofan"immWlC system, IIwhich
existed forthepurpose ofdefending against infec-
tions. It'simportant toremember what scientific
knowledge about the nature oflife was atthat
time-ahnosl nothing that people helieved atthat
time about how ourbodies come intobeing, how
they produce chemical changes, orhow they move
andsense, isnow recognized astrue. Butthebasic
ideaofan"immune system" hashardly changed in
100years.
Although Mechnikov shared the 1908 Nohel
Prize with Paul Ehrlich, Ehrlicb's Nohel lecture
expressed anextremely rcductionist view ofthe
organism, ahnost comical when juxtaposed to
Mechnikov's lecture. According toEhrlich, itwas
necessary forscience todifferentiate "the concept
ofthecellintothatofagreat nwnber ofseparate,
individual functions." Inthat lecture hetalked
about lock-and-key interactions, and receptors on
cells. This was thecourse taken byscience inthe
following century.
Mechnikov's goal directed phagocytes were
accepted aspart ofthe immune system that
increasingly focused onEhrlich's highly specific
antigens and antibodies. Ahhough the immune
system was understood tohave thepuq:x>se of
defending the organism bYdestroying germs, it
wasputintoan"objective" reductionist mechanis-
ticscheme bygiving ititsown evolutionary2
explanation, through the natural selection of
random changes ingenes which, through time,
heearne avery complicated machine that happened
tokillgerms, bystrictly local molecular interac-
tions. The germ killing, autibody forming immune
system was thought tohave evolved bitbybit,
along with theevolution ofthecomplex nervous,
reproductive, and digestive structures and
functions that distinguisb mammals and people
from sponges androundwonns, each feature the
result ofrandom changes that were preserved by
natura1 selection.
Bythe1960s, because oftheability through
"vaccination" tocreate anubodies thatwould bind
even tonewly synthesized substances, theearlier
idea ofasimply genetically programmed immune
system had toheabandoned, because thenumher
ofpossible antibodies would have required a
tremendous amount ofDNA, that wouldn't fit
inside acell. New genetic explanations were
invented toexplain the ability ofthe immune
system toadapt flexibly tounexpected new
diseases. This was achieved bythe idea ofthe
immune system asamicrocosm ofevolutionary
history, inwhich IIypennutabIe genes could ina
very shan time evolve thenew sequences needed
toproduce novel anubodies todestroy novel
pathogens. Itwas stillrandom, butvery filst, and
the celis that were selected, and stimulated to
multiply, formed aclone, theway amutant cancer
cellformed aclone, supposedly giving each tumor
itsunique genetic individuality.
Inaninternational immunology symposium at
theUniversity ofOregon inI%9, afew fiunous
immunologists presented their recently developed
theory ahout immunity, based ontheneodarwinian
theory ofevolution asthe resuh ofrandom
changes that are preserved bynatura1 selection.
The dayafter adescription, toalarge audience, of
anexperiment demonstrating clonal selection, in
which specific immune cellclones were killed ina
culture dish, and shown tostay dead, while other
clones survived, anassistant professor ofdevelop-
mental biology described, toasmall group of
students, anexperiment inwhich hehad replicated
that demonstration ofclonal selection, and then
repealed thesame conditions, but with diffcrent
concentrations ofcells inthedish. With asparse
cell population inthe dish, hisresults were the
same astbose described intheearlier lecture, but
when heincreased thecell population toacertain
point, themissing "clones" reappeared.
Intheabsence ofawhole organism, butwitb a
quorum oftheir peers, the cells were able to
reconstitute afull repertoire ofsensitivity. My
impression ashedescribed theexperiment wasthat
itimplied that each ceil had tohave aknowledge
ofthetype oforganism ithelooged to,rather than
just being committed toexpressing certain genes
fortherestofitslife. Afew weeks later Imet the
professor inthehallandasked ifhewas publishing
theexperiment, andhesaid he written itup
yet. Iwatched foritinthenext few years, but
never saw anything byhim that related toit.Ten
years later, afew other people began questioning
theclonal deletion theory ofselftolerance, butthe
many changes that have been made subsequently
have been essentially topreserve themechanistic
randonmess ofthetheory, and thedoctrine that it
isasystem specifically evolved for fighting
microbes. The goal-<iirectedncss introduced by
Mcchnikov was kept forthesystem asawhole,
but the intentionality was reduced torandom
changes.
This doctrine ofaseparately evolved, and
evolving, immune system provided noinsight into
thephenomenon ofsterile inflammation, and it's
that kind ofinflanunation, which lacks intelligible
goal-directedness, that has become soimportant
forunderstanding the clrronic and degenerative
diseases. andaging.
Before someone thinks ofamechanistic-
neodarwinist theory ofsterile inflammation, Iwant
topropose avery different approach. Life isvery
adaptable, butitisn't infinitely adaptable. Life, in
its highly complex fonus, whether mollusk,
mammal, fungus, orphanerogam, has many
comroon features. and each type basarange of
environments that aremore orless suitable. The
oeodarwinian ideology inclines many biologists to

theright environment.
1be intrauterine environment permits injuries
toberepaired. mostly without inflammation or
scarring, andwhen some oftbose features, such as
high carbon dioxide and sugar content are
provided postnatally, inflammation and scarring
canbeprevented orreduced.
When prenatal envirornnents aremodified, the
development oftheanimal's brain and metabolism
isaffected, affecting thecourse ofthat animal's
life, and influencing subsequent generations. The
wrong balance ofprenatal nutrients can. decrease
themetabolic rate and increase obesity, orabetter
balance canincrease brain development and alert-
ness. When ayoung animal's early lifeisenriched
with stimulation and opportunity forexploration,
itsbrain deveioprrent isimproved (increased cortiÂ·
cal thickness and enzyme activity), and those
changes arepassed ontosubsequent generations,
with cumulative effects iftheimproved environ-
ment continues tobeavailable.
The prenatal absence ofinflammation corre-
sponds toconditions that areproviding energy and
other conditions necessary foravery high rateof
metabolism, with minimal stress. Generalizing
from anunderstanding ofgestation, wecould say
that inflammation, andthefailure oftissue mainte-
nance. occurring later inlife-istheresult ofagap
between the energy that's available and the
demands that aremade ontheorganism orona
particular tissue.
This approach tounderstanding inflammation
suggests why itcontnbutes to degenerative
processes, and suggests potential remedies. butit
also offers anew perspective ontheprocesses that
are called innate and acquired immunity. The
boundaries ofwhat used tohecalled animmune
system have been expanding and becoming
blurred, astheinteractions ofnerves, hormones,
nutrition, tissue repair, reticulo-endothelial system,
phagocytosis, and wandering orstem cells come
tobeunderstood inmore detail.
Jamie Cunliffe and PoUy Matzinger have been
developing anew understanding ofthe immuneâ€¢
system" centered ontheidea that tissue damage is
themain issue, rather than thedistinction between
self and nooself antigens. They recognize that the
old model, especially the "adaptive immune
system," isfailing toexplain things, and they are
giving more weight tothings such asinflammation
that had been attributed toan"innate immune
system," butwhat they aredescribing might better
bedescribed asanalert, inleltigeut organism
maintaining itself.
This new orientation would make "stem cells"
part ofthe "immune since they sense
danger ortissue damage, and adapt torepair it.
The wanderiug while blood cells, rather than being
theend product ofaparticular clone, areable to
transfonn themselves when they find themselves in
new situations, becoming adifferent kind ofcell.
The signals that cause them togowbere they are
needed are related toinflammation, but this is
exactly where immunology and stem cell research
need todirect their attention. 1bese signals are
strongly influenced byenvironmental conditions.
One oftheimportant features oftheintrauter-
ineenvironment isthat itissteadily very warm,
and that means that thefatswhicb aresynthesized
from sugar will berelatively saturated. Ifsugar is
deficient, which iscommon asaresult ofmaternal
bypoglycemia inthethird trimester ofpregnancy,
free fatty acids from themother's tissues and ber
diet will provide energy forthefetus.
The brain requires ahigh level ofsugar for
optimal growth, somaternal undernutrition or
bypoglycemia will increase theratio ofthebaby's
body weight toitsbrain and will change
various other features ofmetabolism and structure.
Ifthemother's fatsarehighly unsaturated, they can

trimester ishighly stressful forthefetus. Besides
causing injury tothe fetus during this time,
producing inflammation and poteutially scarring
and granuloma orfihmma formation, lbeprosta-
glandins activate the stress hormones. such as
corticotropin release bonnonc; which isatrigger
forstimulating the birth process, and sotend to
cause premature delivery.
These polyunsaturated fats, whicb areclearly
alien tothegestational process, interfering inso4
many ways with optimal development, arepresent
inthemother's tissues and fnods because ofthe
type ofenvironment sheoccupies. Ifsheateonly

animals produce mostly satumted fats. thefetus
wouldn't besubjected tothe anti-regenerative,

the fatty acids and prostaglandins. The polyun-
saturated fatty acids, prostaglandins, and inflam-
mation, clearly encroach on the process of
gestation, alteriug the subsequenl life ofthe
exposed individuals, causing them toadapt 10the
world bymetabolizing less energy; they continue
toconstrain development throughout thelives of
those who continue tobeexposed tothem.

during thistime. their head circumferences haven't.
These changes aresimilar tothose seen inanimals
fed increased amounts ofpolyunsaturated fats.
Besides being the precw-sors for the prosta-
glandins, the polyunsaturdted fally acids amplify
inflammation andstress inavariety ofother ways.
The prostaglandins are, inadults asthey arein

animals isclosely related totheir susceptibility to

example ofthis antagonism would betheexperi-

1990).
Theinnervation ofsome regenerating epithelial
tissues, such asthebladder, skin, and cornea, has
been studied inconsiderable detail, and itlsfairly
weU known that thesensory nerves have complex
"trophic" orsustaining effects inthese tissue. For
example, ifsensory nerves aredestroyed inanarea
oftheskin, that area becomes thin andshiny. Since
some ofPavlov's earliest studies, nerves have been
known tohave atrophic function onthetissues
they innervate. Insome tissues-bladder, stomach,
heart, Jiver-complex chemical signals areknown
tobereleased bythe sensory nerves, but the
presence ofnerves inother tissues, such asthe
cortex oftheadrenal gland (Heym, etaI.,1995),
hasn't been sowell studied, thnugh allsuch tissues
are known tohave nerves. Inanimals such as
salamanders, nerves areknown tobeinvolved in
theregeneration oflostparts. Nerves areintrinsic
parts ofcancers, too.
About 50years ago, astudy ofthe production
ofblisters produced byhypnotic suggestion found
that theblister fluid contained ATP, which had
been released bysensory nerves, atthespot that

,JmmoIqque A'Iljqthe cyclooxygenase enzyme, COX-2, which
converts arachidonic acid toprostaglandins.
Besides activating theenzymes tobreak down
the extracellar structure, ATP stimulates cell
division andangiogenesis, allofwhich arenonna!
parts oftissue maintenance. In the bladder,
stretching causes the epithelial cells torelease
ATP, which stimulates sensory nerves; inthis
situation, theepithelial cells are acting assense
organs. andtheATP acts asaneurotransmitter. It
hasasimilar effect inthebreast, inrelation tomilk
ejection (Bowler, etal.,2001). Inother tissues,
such asbone, mechanical forces also release extra-
cellular ATP, andinthissituation itseems tobean
important anabolic stimulus tobone growth and
repair (Furuya, etal.,2004).
ATP isincreasingly recognized (Bumstock,
2007) asabasic neurotransmitter orcotransmitter,
butitissomething more important andbasic than
that: it'saconstant signal ofanycell's presence to
neighboring cells. Iftheconcentration ofATP
varies toomuch. itindicates that something is
wrong. Ifacell is injured orfails toproduce
enough energy, itleaks ATP. During oxygen
deficiency, the leaking ATP causes
increasing circulation, and inthe respiratory
center, itstimulates breathing (Buttigieg and
Nurse, 2004; Conde, etaI.,2012).
Intheprenatal environment, lacking polyun-
satwated fatty acids from theenvironment, ATPis
involved intheorderly development oftheorgan-
ism, adjustiog rates ofgrowth inacoordinated
way. This system, thatcanbeseen inembryology
and the early stages ofgestation, has allthe
properties ofaself-regulatiog control system, with
abuilt-in intention todevelop inacertain
direction. The intention thatMechnikov saw inthe
phagocyte, isinthewhole organism. Cells that will
later bethought ofaspartof"the immune system"
arepresent atthe very early stages ofembrynnic
participating inits coming into
existence. 1bere isDOgenetic "blueprint" that is

Not long ago, following the cult ofthe

were "read out" atanearly stage ofdevelopment.
from agenetic blueprint that would never be
accessible again. That doctrine lasted for 100
years, until someooe tested it(Jobosoo, etaI.,
2004, 2005; Bakovsky, etaI.,2005; White, etaI.,
2012). Asthey showed, theembryo and tbeadoh

ing ways, but genetics and immunology have
created fragmentary, mechanistic descriptions of

During development, thecoordinated growth
and functioning ofthesystem isaffected bythe
chemicals intheenvironment that theorganism
encounters. The prostaglandins reflect aparticular
ecosystem inwhich plants produce certain unsatu-
raled tatty acids, butbiomedical ideologues have
idealized them, following thedoctrine that this is
theenvironment that weevolved tolivein.This is
very much likethenutrition professor atOregon
State University who taught students that white
bread should beincluded inthediet because God
gave ittous.
Lacking PUF Aand prostaglandins, extracellu-
larATPwould activate constructive pathways,
tending tocreate anew equihbriwn, without
producing alloftheharmful effects oftbeprosta-
glandins. As unstable polyunsaturated lilts
accumulate inthetissues with aging, they increas-
ingly promote vicious circles ofstress (some of
those were described inFats, Functions &
Malfunctions).

ism's potentials andthepresent environment, and
suggesting ways toimprove theenvironment, isn't

institutionalized attitude, that people must be

Eugenics, sterilization, vaccination, health educa-
tion, and publicity campaigns explaining whY
cancer, beart disease, and obesity arecaused by
cboices theindividnal makes, arewell financed and
supported bylarge organizations.6
The idea ofautoimmunity epitomizes this
general situation, inwhich reductionist theories
arcinvoked toexplain why aperson iscausing his
own sickness. Ifantibodies evolved toattack
microbes, then the immune system has become
defective when itproduces antiOOdies against its
own tissue. Butifthesystem ofwandering ceUs,
complement, antibodies, etc., has todowith
development and maintenance oftheorganism, the
presence ofantibodies andother "immune" factors
would beexpected whenever atissue isdamaged.
Simply twisting apiece ofcartilage has been
shown tomake itantigenic, andmany other things
causing sterile inflanunation cause antibodies to
appear. Strokes orother brain injuries cause
antibodies tobeproduced. The presence ofauto-
antibodies hasbeen found tofacilitate therecovery
from anaseptic inflammatory condition ofthe
brain, accelerating healing and re-vascularization
(Hofstetter, etat., 2003). Intravenous immuno-
globulin hasalong history ofusetoreduce inllam-
mation (Nimmerjalm and Ravetch, 2008), and it
has been tested asatreatment forheart fililure,
producing anti-inflammatory effects (Aukrust, ct
aI.,2006).
Components ofthecomplement system and
C-reactive protein, which areincreased bytissue
injury, areinvolved intheanti-inOammatory clear-
ance ofdying cells (Gershov, etaI.,2001).
The presence ofthe"essential fatty acids" isan
important fuctor intheallergenicity oftransplanted
tissues (Schreiner, etaI.,1988), which might be
expected, from therole oftheprostaglandins in
creating inflammation wherever atissue is
stressed.

Many ofthethings that can heachieved by
vaccination and treatment with safe anti-
inflammatories such asaspirin could bedone better
bylong-term changes ofdiet, andbytaking inlo
account the interactions of the hormones,.
especially progesterone, estrogen, and thyroid,
with nutrients andstressors. But much more than
thaI isneeded: The nature oftherelationships
helween environmental fuelors and the body's
reactions hastobeclarified, sothattheprocesses
ofhealing and regeneration can more closely
resemble theprenatal condition, possibly even
continuing in adulthood the "pedomorphicl1
process, realizing human potentials that haven't
previously been seen.
