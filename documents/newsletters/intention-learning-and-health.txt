Intention, Learning,
and Health
Everyone recognizes that changes occur when
we adapt to a new climate, a new diet, a new sport,or a new kind of work; the idea of “body building”is based on the understanding that choices of activ-ity can cause major changes in appearance andabilities. However, the exact nature of adaptivechange has been poorly defined, and has beeninfluenced by ideological and dogmatic commit-
ments , especially related to inheritance. 
The idea that individual cells
might, in a purposeful and usefulway, change their functions andstructures in response to somethingin their environment . . . has been,for more than 100 years, somethingto deny and to discourage to protectthe reductionist-mechanistic model
of reality. 
Even Charles Darwin acknowledged the
existence of inheritance of acquired traits, andproposed that cellular changes in the bodyproduced by interactions with the environmentwere transmitted through the blood to the gonadsand germ cells as particles he called gemmules.One reaction against that idea was that the appara-tus of heredity exists only in the nuclei of the germcells, and that the nuclear material is absolutelyimpervious to the effects of the environment. For more than 100 years the dogma of the
isolation of the “germ line” from the “soma” influ-enced every aspect of thinking in biology andmedicine. One of the derivative ideas was Crick’sCentral Dogma of molecular biology, that infor-mation flows from (nuclear) DNA to(cytoplasmic) protein, and never in the reversedirection. Another derivative dogma was that thenucleus is “the brain of the cell.” Supporting thatidea was the dogma that the cytoplasm of the cellconsists of a membrane-enclosed fluid in whichthings occur only by random diffusion—randominteraction of solutes could hardly have a guidingbrain-like function. Some people who couldn’taccept the “nuclear brain” idea decided that thecell membrane (constructed according to thenuclear blueprint) must be the source of the cell’smeaningfully organized behavior.
When a person chooses a new kind of activity
their cells cooperate by changing their nature,“behaving” differently. More than 100 years ago,some of the best known and best financed biologi-cal research was designed to prove that cells don’t“behave,” since behavior implies intrinsic aware-ness and purposeful action; their reactions werecalled “tropisms,” implying a purely mechanicalchange in reaction to a stimulus. Shortly after thedoctrine of tropisms was established for singlecells such as amebas and paramecia, the Behavior-ist movement in what had been psychology,following J.B. Watson’s false description of themeaning of Pavlov’s work, began claiming thathuman life operated similarly, and that conscious-ness and purpose didn’t exist. Later, B.F. Skinnerargued that ideas of moral autonomy, freedom,and human dignity were hindrances to understand-ing human nature.Ray Peat's Newsletter

Not for republication without written permission.Researchers (such as Beatrice Gelber) who
demonstrated that single cell organisms can learnpurposefully were sidelined, and written out ofscience, but a few people have continued toproduce evidence of intelligent, purposeful behav-ior, and deliberate useful changes in their DNA,even by bacteria (James A. Shapiro). 
The conditions that evoke the
formation of exosomes that areappropriate for the problem causedby stress are continually changing,and are different in different parts of
the body.
Many practical biologists, plant and animal
breeders, kept the idea of adaptive inheritancealive, and the idea of cytoplasmic inheritancebegan developing as an alternative to nuclearinheritance. Starting in the 1930s and ’40s, TracySonneborn’s work with unicellular parameciabegan to show that inheritance isn’t just nuclear.When cytoplasmic inheritance could no longer bedenied, its real meaning was denied by arguingthat it operated through the same kind of genes asnuclear inheritance, “plasmids” floating in theformless cytoplasm, containing some DNA thathad either escaped from the nucleus, or that hadoriginated from symbiotic bacteria. Interest inSonneborn’s work was effectively redirected,either by seeing it as just more Mendelian genetics,or, when that wasn’t possible, to declare thatparamecia were no longer suitable organisms forstudying inheritance. 
One of Sonneborne’s experiments that
undoubtedly contributed to the declining interest inparamecium research involved microsurgery, inwhich he cut out and reversed a section of theorganism’s surface, so that the cilia that normallybeat in a direction that propelled the cell forwardwould beat in the reverse direction. The animalsurvived, and the cilia in that area always beat inthe wrong direction for the rest of its life. When itdivided, the daughter cells, and all the followingdescendants had the same patch of reversed cilia. Itwas obvious that the “body plan” of the parame-cium isn’t under the control of the genes. When research in a wide range of animals, and
humans, began making it impossible to deny thatenvironmental conditions can cause transgenera-tional effects, the reality of “epigenetics” wasaccepted by mainstream biologists as anon-Mendelian form of inheritance, but theydetoxified and denatured it, by finding mecha-nisms that could account for it, but only in a verylimited and temporary way, that didn’t have anyinfluence at all on their basic doctrine, that the“germ line” is ultimately impenetrable by adaptivechanges in response to new environmental situa-tions. The changes they accept do nothing morethan influence which of the inherited eternal DNAgenes will be expressed for a while, allowing theoriginal, species-defining traits to be restoredwhen the suppressive effects are removed. Forthem, “epigenetics” refers to a change in the stateof cellular differentiation that persists through celldivision; an early source of the word wasWaddington’s use of “epigenesis” to refer to thechanges of gene expression that produce stablechanges in cell differentiation during the processof development of the organism.
Experiments have made it clear
that experience is always modifyingour being, and that our continuousprocesses of adaptation and devel-opment can’t be separated fromour understanding of the world. 
The belief in genetic determinism has had a
strong influence on the understanding of an organ-ism’s adaptation to its environment. The differen-tiated state of the cells in our body is usuallyconsidered to be terminal, and occurs when anundifferentiated precursor or stem cell receivesspecific influences that cause a particular patternof gene expression, which then persists innon-dividing cells. During the development fromstem and precursor cells, the “epigenetic” factors,DNA methylation, histone acetylation, formationof micro-RNA, etc., stabilize the differentiatedstate of the cell. 
This view of cellular differentiation is conven-
ient for the medical doctrine of incurable2diseases—the state of differentiation follows an
orderly plan, and that plan changes only by chang-ing something in the cell’s nucleus. When tumorcells are formed, it’s because something hasrandomly interfered with the plan, disrupting thegenes, in a manner that can only get worse. 
The idea that individual cells might, in a
purposeful and useful way, change their functionsand structures in response to something in theirenvironment, without having to go through a seriesof differentiating cell divisions, has been, for morethan 100 years, something to deny and to discour-age to protect the reductionist-mechanistic modelof reality. 
For a long time, the changes of aging were
explained as the result of accumulation of randomsomatic mutations, irreversibly destroying genesand the tissue functions that depend on them. Thatidea was proven to be contrary to the evidence, andit was replaced by the idea of irreversible celldifferentiation, a pattern of gene transcription thatstrongly resists change, held in place by epigeneticmodification of the genes (Nacarelli, et al., 2017;Nacarelli and Sell, 2017; Lopes-Paciencia, et al.,2019). The origin of the problem is always in thegenes, and the general picture has hardly changedfrom the time when random somatic mutationsexplained aging, degeneration, and cancer.
Exosomes, virus sized particles emitted by
cells, especially when they are under stress, areknown to transmit information to other cells withinan organism, and to modify their state of differen-tiation (Hayashi and Hoffm an, 2017). There is now
good evidence showing that they, like Darwin’sgemmules, can transmit information from somaticcells to germ cells. Their functions within theorganism are now widely considered to be an agentof epigenetic adaptation. They carry many differ-ent substances, including microRNA and otherfactors that modify DNA methylation and histoneacetylation.  Current attention is directed to under-standing the way that exosomes modify geneexpression, the state of differentiation, in the cellsthat receive them, emphasizing the stability of thechanges. 
I think the crucial question is how the cell
that produces them has organized their compo-sition so that their effects in the organism willachieve an adaptive effect, often a restorativeeffect that corrects harmful conditions that
have been produced by stress. This is intelligent
purposive behavior, usually beneficial for theorganism. In the case of cancer cells, the changesthey cause are good for the survival of the cancer,but bad for the organism. 
In the process of optimizing our
interactions with our environments,we need to continually improveconditions, rather than reducing our
needs to match 
poor environments.
The conditions that evoke the formation of
exosomes that are appropriate for the problemcaused by the stress are continually changing, andare different in different parts of the body.Environmental conditions elicit quick, intelligent,evaluative reactions from the cells. In a chroni-cally bad environment, these changes that are thebest that can be achieved at the moment, willcontinue to accumulate, and the accumulation ofcontextually appropriate reactions will lead toharmful degenerative effects, as long as theenvironment presents stressful conditions. 
Rather than blaming the cells, as in the current
doctrine of aging as an accumulation of cells withthe “senescence-associated secretory phenotype,”SASP, we might consider the effects of eliminat-ing the harmful features of the environment. Ifcells are purposefully and perceptively adaptive,we would expect cells in a more suitable environ-ment to begin to re-adapt, eliminating theiradaptations to a harmful environment, includingSASP cells and fibrotic tissues with depressedoxidative metabolism, and to begin producingfully vital cells adapted to life at a higher energylevel.
The experiments that showed learning in
single cells, which obviously can’t involvechanges in synapses, conflicted with the theoriesof learning based on a computer model in whichsynapses correspond to transistors, and axonscorrespond to wires. In the last 75 years therehave been great advances in understanding howawareness might exist in living substance, disre-garding the schemes in which awareness consists3of abstract information, resting on a foundation of
a network of synapses, and instead viewing it as adirect physical interaction between the perceiverand the perceived. 
Our society has invented some
institutions that powerfully negate ourbasic need to understand and to
develop coherently.
Rather than the digital basis of information
theory, this approach is analogic, and functionsprimarily with wholes, rather than parts that gaintheir meaning only indirectly. Luca Turin’s studiesof odors and chemical perception provide a goodintroduction to this view of the brain. 
In the 1940s, Denis Gabor worked out the
physical theory of holography, in which3-dimensional images can be stored in a solidsubstance, in a non-localized way. Around thesame time Karl Lashley was trying to find where“memories are stored” in the brain (the “engram”),by destroying parts of the cortex after the animalhad been trained. By the 1950s, he had determinedthat memories weren’t stored in particularlocations, but that the whole cortex of the brainwas involved in every memory. Later, KarlPribram, who worked with Lashley, realized thatGabor’s hologram was at least a good metaphor forthe way the brain works, with a particular memorydistributed throughout a mass of tissue, rather thanbeing localized in an “engram.”
Although Pribram didn’t question the basic
doctrine of on-off, digital function of nerveimpulses, he proposed that the fields created incomplex networks of synapses might be able tostore experience in a holographic manner. Recog-nizing that perception is organized in wholepatterns, or Gestalts, he proposed that similarprinciples might organize behavior—he calledthese behavioral programs “Images of Achieve-ment.” Unfortunately, even while assembling theideas of others constructively, he didn’t discard themechanistic methods and beliefs of Behaviorism. 
Decades earlier, in the 1930s, P.K. Anokhin
had worked out an alternative to the mechanistictheories of behavior based on reflexes, and devel-oped a cybernetic and holistic view of intelligentbehavior. The organism’s perception and behavior
were described as unified “Functional Systems,”which included metabolic, endocrine, andadaptive-developmental processes, as well asawareness and action. Anokhin called the modelof the world, including the organism’s needs andactions, the “Action Acceptor,” which was alwaysbeing revised according to the success of theaction, which validated the organism’s under-standing of the situation. Information fromproprioceptors as well as external senses wascontinuously renewing this model of the world.
Anokhin understood the holistic nature of
perception, and, having avoided the atomizingassumptions that broke behavior down into stimuliand reflexes, he also avoided the assumption thatnerves conducted only “on-off” information,binomial digital messages, and he describedexamples in which a single nerve transmittedcomplex signals. If a single-celled organism can“mentally model,” or imagine, itself in a world,why should we imagine that our nerve cells can’tdeal with anything more complex than “on-off”information?
Every cell in the body, except blood cells and
cancer cells, contains a “primary cilium,” whichhas an internal structure similar to the cilia that areused for propulsion, except that it lacks the partsneeded for movement. These cilia are the cells’sense organelles; they have different specializa-tions—they can detect the movement of fluids,pressure, sounds, odors, and light. Every brain cellcontains one of these sensory organelles. In thehippocampus, the primary cilia are involved incontextual memory (Rhee, et al., 2016). They alsoallow cells to align their polarity according totheir position in the body. 
If the olfactory cell can, as Luca Turin
describes, identify the complex vibratory patternsof chemicals, why would other nerves be unableto recognize and transmit the same information toother parts of the brain? In the eyes and auditorynerves, why would the specific qualities sensed bythe primary cilia have to be reduced to on-offsignals for transmission?  If the signals transmit-ted by nerve axons are complex, then the issue of“distributed” knowledge is explained—each partis aware of its place in a Gestalt, in the ActionAcceptor, allowing it to align its functions with4the purposeful future-oriented activity of the whole
organism. 
In the case of muscle cells, endocrine cells,
cytokine producing cells, etc., this alignment iswhat the Functional Systems consist of. Cell disso-lution and cell multiplication, as well asre-differentiation, are elicited by the needs of thefunctional system. The form, function, and beingof the organism are governed by the FunctionalSystems, in a continuously adapting process.
In the 1950s, when most psychologists
believed that only vertebrates were capable oflearning, James McConnell demonstrated thatflatworms, planaria, could be trained to changetheir behavior. These worms are able to regeneratea whole body, including the brain, from any part ofthe organism. McConnell found that worms regen-erated from a part, such as the tail, of a trainedworm retained the knowledge that had beenacquired by that worm. He also found that whentrained worms were gr ound up and fed to untrained
worms, those worms learned the behavior moreeasily. He suggested that RNA molecules synthe-sized following the worm’s training might beresponsible for distributing the learned behaviorthroughout the whole organism. During the 1960s,several other researchers found that extracts fromthe brains of other animals, including insects, fish,and rats, could transfer learned behavior tountrained animals. In 2013, experimentersconfirmed McConnell’s work, by demonstratingthat after being decapitated, the regeneratedflatworms retained their training.
These experiments have made it clear that
experience is always modifying our being, and thatour continuous processes of adaptation and devel-opment can’t be separated from our understandingof the world. 
In the process of optimizing our interactions
with our environments, we need to continuallyimprove conditions, rather than reducing our needsto match poor environments. The brain is alwaysthe organ that maintains the Acceptor of Actionand organizes the Functional Systems to guide ourdevelopment, and with each success the achieve-ment is institutionalized in our metabolism,improving the intensity and range of our under-standing, and increasing the power and efficiencyof the brain. Simply realizing the absolute
importance of the environmentsthat we are constantly adapting tocan lead to learning how to adaptmore appropriately, and how tomake our environments morelife-supporting .
Biologists have recognized this process in all
animals—“cephalization,” the process of develop-ment of bigger and better brains operating in morecomplex and appropriate environments. Improvednutritional and hormonal support can increase thebrain’s size, complexity, and learning ability. Anenriched environment improves brain function,thickness of the cortex, and longevity, whilereducing inflammation and increasing immunity(Carughi, et al., 1989; Laviola, et al., 2004;Arranz, et al., 2010; Jurgens and Johnson, 2012;do Prado, et al., 2016; Pusic, et al., 2016). Impov-erished, boring, stressful environments have theopposite effects.
Our society has invented some institutions that
powerfully negate our basic need to understandand to develop coherently. The professionalizationof medicine, for example, has contributed to aweakening of the population’s ability to perceiveits needs and to imagine appropriate solutions.Authoritarian attitudes throughout the culturecreate distrust of autonomous understanding andof independent choice of goals. “Science,”especially medical science, has become life’sgreatest danger, when its goal has become theempowerment of “artificial intelligence,” central-izing control, institutionalizing the reductionistview of knowledge, and displacing actualintelligence. 
Simply realizing the absolute importance of
the environments that we are constantly adaptingto can lead to learning how to adapt more appro-priately, and how to make our environments morelife-supporting.5REFERENCES
