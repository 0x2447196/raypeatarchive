..Resveratrol, rate ofliving,
C02, and aging
A·year agoGlaxoSmithKline bought Sirtris, a
company focusing onthebiological effects of
resveratrol, for$720,000,000. Harvard Medical
School's website, atld broadcasts. byBarbara
Walters and Morley Safer have publicized
asalongevity-increasing drug, and
Ill1lhons ofpeople arespending large amounts of
money forresveratrol capsules.
The main claim being made about resveratrol
isthat itcan mimic theanti-aging effects of
calorie restriction, without having torestrict food
This involves silencing genes,
blocking theIr production ofRNA andprotein.
The mass media and some medical journals
aren't giving abalanced description ofthebiologi-
caleffects ofresveratrol, butmany biologists are
being influenced too, bythe same simple
arguments that thetelevision reporters SUIll1lla-
rized. The academic biology culture, themedical
culture, andthebasic American culture itself, are
allpermeated bytheidea ofgenetic determinism,
sowhen aDNA molecule inyeast isidentified as
th<>"ant" "d Il' I-agmg gene, anarnoeCille ISfOli..Tld that
activates it,that molecule, orsomething similar,
seems tothem clearly tobeananti-aging drug,
Part ofthecultural framework that makes it
easy tosellthat idea istheold"rate ofliving"
theory ofaging, theidea that wehave only so
many heartbeats inalifetime, thatwecanuseonly
somany calories and somuch oxygen ina
lifetime, andthat organisms with alowmetabolic
rate therefore live longer than those with ahigh
metabolic rate. Therateofliving theory isclosely
related the"wear andtear" theory ofaging, that
ourbodIes are(except forourgerm cells) made up
of"post-mitotic cells," unable tocontinue divid-
ingonce growth iscomplete, and somust diewhen those cells are"worn out." Bythemiddle of
20th century, those ideas hadbeen disproved
mmany ways, butinthe1960s Leonard Hayflick
rene,:ed foratime thedoctrine ofaging asthe
wearmg out ofunrenewable cells, with his
doctrine that somatic cells (non-germ cells) have
an limit of50replications.
cloned anlIDals from somatic cells, andthesubse-
quent excitement about stem cells, made that
theory obsolete (again).
The "longevity gene," named Sir2 inyeasts,
worms, and flies (itsequivalent inmammals is
called SirTl), isactivated byrestricting calories,
andcaloric restriction isknown toextend lifespan
(though therestriction ofcertain nutrients can
increase longevity, without restricting
calones). Both semi-starvation and increased
activity oftheSir2 gene canprevent obesity and
obesity hassome harmful effects. The prom'oters
thetheory suggest that aresveratrol-like drug
beable toprevent obesity andcure type-2
dIabetes. They arealso suggesting that itcould
slow aging andincrease longevity.
Talking about the"aging" ofasingle-celled
organism such asyeast, anddrawing conclusions
about theaging ofmulticellular organisms and
from events inthe lifeofyeast, is
meanmgful only topeople who subscribe tothe
Hayflick doctrine, and who deny thereality of
cells inmammals andother complex organ-
Isms. They are actually talking about the
"fertility," thereproductive growth capacity, of
theyeasts. The study ofyeast metabolism and
growth developed mostly inrelation totheneeds
ofthewine and beer industries, and that has
?iased ideas about theways yeast adapts tochang-
mgecosystems. Yeasts adapt their reproductive
strategy tothe perceived adequacy oftheir
environment. Anindividual yeast cellcoordinates
itsphysiology with thesurrounding cells, inways
analogous tothe ways individual cells inan
animal participate inthe coherence ofthe
organism.
Asinhigher organisms, stress canaccelerate
the reproductive process inyeast. Inanimals,
stress can cause precocious puberty, asifthey
were being exposed toanexcess ofestrogen.
Resveratrol isadefensive fungicidal antibiotic, or
phytoalexin, soit'sreasonable that itwould be
perceived asastressor byyeast. Itisalso a
phytoestrogen, and formany years yeasts have
been known toberesponsive toestrogenic
substances. Tothebrewing industry, these effects
ofphytoestrogens are known toinfluence the
biomass, butwhen therate ofgrowth isconsid-
ered torepresent aging, then increased biomass is
equivalent toincreased longevity.
Anyone familiar with thelast40years ofyeast
research would presumably know that phenolic
phytoalexins areestrogenic, andthatthegrowth of
yeast isinfluenced byestrogenic substances, and
also that estrogenic substances such asresveratrol
could bevery dangerous ifconsumed inexagger-
atedly large amounts.
Resveratrol isastilbene, similar instructure to
diethylstilbestrol, DES, the famously toxic-
carcinogenic pharmaceutical. Estrogens affect all
ofthesystems affected byresveratrol, andfor67
years, theestrogen industry hasbeen telling the
public that whatever estrogen does isbeneficial---
more than 200 medical conditions have been
benefited byestrogen treatment, according tothe
medical literature/pharmaceutical advertising.
Many people have been asserting that the
reason calorie restriction canextend lifeisthat it
activates "the antiaging gene, Sir2." Arecent
publication (Carrano, etal.,2009) from theSalk
institute proposes thattwoother genes arerespon-
sible forcalorie-restriction longevity intheround-
worm, C.elegans.
But restricting calories has amultitude of
effects--Sir2 isonly oneofhundreds ofgenes that
function differently inhunger-stressed animals.
Calorie restriction isstressful, butthenature of
that stress andtheresponse toitdepends onthe
whole situation, just asinany other challenging
situation.
One problem with theSirtris scheme isthat
increased Sir2 activity shortens the actual2
chronological lifespan ofnon-dividing yeast
(Kennedy, etal.,2005; Fabrizio, etal.,2005). In
animals, increasing theactivity ofSirTl might
contribute tothedevelopment ofcancer (Liu, et
al., 2009). It might also be involved in
Alzheimer's disease, andthereplacement ofnerve
cells in thebrain with astrocytes orother glial
cells. Gliosis can occur innormal aging, but
inflammation can produce extreme degrees of
fibrosis ofthebrain orspongy encephalopathy.
Estrogens also have this effect ofaccelerating
stem cellproduction ofglial cells.
Inarecent study, todetermine whether
resveratrol would slow theheart rate and lower
thebody temperature inmice (asexpected accord-
ingtotherateofaging doctrine', those metabolic
indicators were· depressed byresveratrol forone.
day, butthen returned tonormal. However, the
endurance ofthemice onatreadmill was reduced
bytheresveratrol treatment (Mayers, etal.,2009) ..
Going beyond theSir2 gene-based argument,
many researchers have examined resveratrol's
effects onvarious other genes. Too often, itseems
that theauthors reason that whatever resveratrol
does tothose genes must begood for the
organism. These arguments seem tobefollowing
thereasoning that hasbeen systematically used to
promote estrogen andpolyunsaturated fats.
Ifweconsider theeffects ofresveratrol inthe
context ofthewell established facts about the
metabolic processes associated with long life, we
will notice many things thatshould lead toskepti-
cism about the claims being made bythe
advertisers.
Alittle stress can malce anorganism more
resistant tosubsequent stresses. However, resvera-
trolfails toextend thelifespan ofnormal mice,
being effective only inastrain ofmice that
becomes abnormally fatonanormal diet.
About 40years ago, when people first began
promoting fish oilasalongevity factor, Alex
Comfort watched therats that were being given
thefish oilintheir food. The food smelled bad,
and therats ateitonly when they were very
hungry, sothey ateless andwere leaner than the
animals that were getting thestandard diet. Their
increased longevity was the result ofavoiding
obesity.
.Inalong-term study atNllI, rhesus monkeys
arebeing studied tolearn whether calorie restric-
tion extends thelifespan ofprimates, asitdoes
certain (genetically fat)rodents. The monkeys are
kept insmall cages. Confinement causes severe
stress. Rats that areallowed tobite something
while restrained suffer less physical stress, fewer
ulcers, andaremore able tomaintain normal body
temperature. Restraint normally lowers body
.temperature, lowering thyroid and increasing
cortisol.
Eating inresponse tostress ameliorates some
ofthehormonal changes, butthemonkeys thatare
permitted toeatasmuch asthey want during their
lifeofconfinement have become very obese. They
look much le:;;s agitated than the low calorie
monkeys, andtheir body temperatures arehigher.
The rate-of-living doctrine causes the
researchers toreason that thelow-calorie diet is
slowing therate ofaging bylowering their body
temperature. However, their metabolic rate, per
gram ofnon-fat tissue, hasn't decreased.
An important difference that has been
observed isthat thechromosomes ofthecalorie
deprived monkeys have more defects.
Nitric oxide, which ispromoted byresveratrol,
according tonumerous publications (Klinge, etal.,
2008; Gresele, etal.2008; Gan, etal.,2009), and
estrogens (acting partly through nitric oxide),
including some phytoestrogens, cause chromoso-
mal damage (Banerjee, etal.,1994; Kulling, etaI.,
1999) which contributes tocancer andpossibly to
birth defects. Nitric oxide hasbeen proposed tobe
amajor factor incausing thedegenerative diseases
ofaging.
If these monkey experiments have any
relevance tohuman biology, itistodemonstrate
that prolonged torture byconfmement and food
restriction causes bodily damage, intheform of
chromosomal abnormalities. But unless thenext
generation ofmonkeys isexamined for birth
defects and other problems, thefullmeaning of
theexperiment won't beapparent.
Insome ofthe publications claiming that
resveratrol increases lifespan, itwas reported that
niacinamide had theopposite effect, suppressing
Sir2, thelongevity gene, andshortening theorgan-
ism's lifespan. Toputtheir claims into context,3
it'shelpful tolook atavariety ofexperiments
involving treatment with niacinamide.
It protects nerves, vascular cells, insulin-
producing cells inthepancreas, andavariety of
other types ofcell from cell death produced by
lack ofoxygen, excitotoxicity, endotoxin, and a
variety ofstressors andtoxins. (Niacinamide acts
inmany ways asanegation ofresveratrol; for
example, resveratr01 interferes with Jheability of
the beta cells tosecrete insulin [Szkudelski,
2007]).
Niacinamide protects mitochondrial respira-
tion from many oftheage-related factors thatcan
damage mitochondria and decrease energy
production. Lipopolysaccharide, the bacterial
endotoxin, increases theproduction ofthefree
radical nitric oxide, leading tothesecretion of
inflammatory mediators and thesuppression of
energy production bythe mitochondria. These
effects areblocked byniacinamide (Fukuzawa, et
al., 1997). Calorie restriction also protects
mitochondrial respiration, inyeasts (Lin, etal.,
2002) andrats(Broderick, etal.,2002)
The "replicative lifespan" ofhuman cells in
vitro isextended bytreatment with niacinamide
(Kang, etaI.,2006).
Inanexperiment with human keratinocytes in
vitro, resveratrol hadtheopposite effect, reducing
their ability todivide (Blander, etal.,2009). By
thedefinitions of"aging" used bytheadvocates of
therate-of-living theory, this experiment suggests
that resveratrol causes premature aging. Estrogen
hasasimilar effect onkeratinocytes. Resveratrol,
nitric oxide, and estrogen, unlike niacinamide,
suppress mitochondrial respiration. Resveratrol
inhibits theformation ofprogesterone (Chen, et
al.,2007), which issynthesized inmitochondria.
The NllI researchers reported that thefood
deprived monkeys (contrary totheir expl;lctation)
didn't have alower rateofmetabolism, butmany
experiments done with avariety ofvery different
animals through much ofthelastcentury found
that ahigher metabolic rate corresponded to
increased longevity. Within agiven species of
bird ormammal, thehigher rateofmetabolism is
often associated with ahigher body temperature,
andalong lifespan ..
But when different types ofanimal ofvery
different sizes arecompared, smaller animals may
have ahigher rate ofmetabolism, butashorter
lifespan, than alarger animal, asinthecase of
mice and elephants. This example was used
recently byanendocrinologist, Martin Surles, to
argue- against treating "subclinical
hypothyroidism." He suggests that -hypothyioid
people, who have alower rateofmetabolism than
euthyroid people, arelikely tolivelonger, because
their metabolism isanalogous totheslow metabo-
lism ofelephants, rather than thefastmetabolism
ofmice.
Comparing animals ofdifferent species, such
asbirds, -monkeys, and rodents, ofsimilar sizes,
those wit.;' thehighest metabolic 'rate arelikely to
have thelongest average andmaximum lifespans:
The smaller anorganism is,themore easily it
loses heat totheenvironment. Most ofamouse's
metabolic energy isspent simply maintaining its
body temperature. -Large animals have less surface
area inproportion totheir mass, sothey spend
relatively little energy intemperature regulation.
One oftheideas deeply associated with- the
rate-of-living theory ofaging isthatourmetabolic
energy isspent mainly forregulating theconcen-
tration ofsalts andother substances incells, with
asmall amount used forsecretion, movement,
and--a relatively recent admission--for thought.
Gilbert Ling hasdemonstrated thefalsity of
the idea that "membrane pumps" regulate the
concentratons ofdissolved materials, and showed
that theamount ofenergy needed tooperate them
constantly would bemuch greater than the
metaholic capacity ofanyorganism.
The fact that those "membrane-based" energy
consuming processes don't exist leaves alotof
energy tobeaccounted for. One ofthe main
energy-consuming activities ofacellisjust being
alive, thatis,adapting, sensing, responding, antici-
pating, orienting itself toitsenvironment. Except
invery special circumstances, thesubstance ofa
cell isinconstant motion, andthemolecules are
being consumed andreconstructed, inaprocess of
continuous renewal. These intracellular streams of
renewal ofmolecules andorganelles areparalleled
onthescale oftissues andorgans byaprocess of
renewal, inwhich new cells areborn andunneces-
sary cells aredissolved.4
Part ofthe"rate ofliving" relates totherateof
renewal oftheorganism. Another part relates to
issues such astheloss ofheat, -that makes life
shorter andharder forvery small animals.
The end product ofrespiration iscarbon
dioxide, and itisanessential component ofthe
life process. The ability toproduce arid retain
enough carbon dioxide isasimportant forlongev-
ityastheability toconserve enough heat toallow
chemical reactions tooccur asneeded.
Carbon dioxide protects cells inmany ways.
Bybonding toamino groups, itcaninhibit the
glycation ofproteins during oxidative stress, and
itcanlimit theformation offree radicals inthe
blood; inhibition ofxanthine oxidase isone
mechanism (Shibata, e-c-aI., 1998). Itcanreduce
inflammation caused byendQtoxin/LPS, bylower-
ingtheformation oftumor necrosis factor, IL-8
andother promoters ofinflammation (Shimotaka-
hara, etal., 2008). Itprotects mitochondria
(Lavani, etal., 2007), maintaining (or even
increasing) their ability torespire during stress.
The "replicative lifespan" ofacell can be
shortened byfactors like resveratrol orestrogen
that interfere with mitochondrial production of
carbon dioxide. Both ofthose chemicals cause
skin cells, keratinocytes, tostop dividing, totake
upcalcium, and tobegin producing thehorny
material keratin, that allows superficial skin cells
toform aneffective barrier. This process normally
occurs asthese cells differentiate from thebasal
(stem) cells and, bymultiplying, move farther
outward away from theunderlying blood vessels
thatprovide thenutrients that areoxidized toform
carbon dioxide, and asthey getfarther from the
blood supply, they getcloser totheexternal air,
which contains less than 1%asmuch C02 asthe
blood. This normally causes their eventual
hardening into thekeratin cells, butwhen condi-
tions areoptimal, numerous layers ofmoist, trans-
lucent cells that give theskin thecharacteristic
appearance ofyouth, will beretained between the
basal cells and the condensed surface layers.
(Wilke, etal.,1988)
Inother types oftissue, ahigh level ofcarbon
dioxide hasasimilar stabilizing effect oncells,
preserving stem cells, limiting stress andprevent-
ingloss offunction. Inthelining ofthemouth,
where theoxygen tension islower, and carbon
dioxide higher, thecells don't form asmuch
keratin astheskin cells do..Intheuterus, the
lining cells would behave similarly, except· that
estrogen stimulates keratinization. Avitamin A
deficiency mimics anestrogen excess, and can
cause excessive keratinization ofmembrane cells.
Yeasts adapt their physiology andlifecycle to
their particular ecological situation. The cells
within an animal behave analogously, butthat is
likely tobeforgotten ordenied, because ofthe
culture ofgenetic determinism.
The cells ineach organ andtissue ofthebody
arearranged inways thatallow them tomake their
contribution tothefunction oftheorganism, while
receiving oxygen, glucose, and regulatory
substances inthe blood, and maintaining and
.renewing themselves. Except fortheskin, their
situation amid other cells assures that they will
liveinahigh concentration ofcarbon dioxide.
There areproteins (uncoupling proteins, VCP)
that cause the mitochondria toincrease their
consumption ofoxygen without increasing their
synthesis ofATP. Thesynthesis ofATP isusually
thought ofasthemain reason fortheconsumption
ofoxygen, sotheVCP have been assumed toexist
toincrease heat production. The formation of
carbon dioxide isusually thought ofasjust an
unavoidable consequence. VCP proteins,
however, exist insituations inwhich heat produc-
tion doesn't seem appropriate (Borecky &
Vercesi, 2005; Aguilera, etal.,2005; Gnanaling-
ham, etal.,2005). Forexample, fasting orcalorie
restriction increases VCP, tending tocause tissues
toconsume energy more rapidly. Stress and
hypoxia also canincrease VCP, suggesting that
these enzymes have protective functions.
Increasing theformation ofcarbon dioxide
seems tometobetheessential function ofthe
VCP. Thyroid hormone (T3) increases VCP, and
VCP increases the formation of new
mitochondria. Increased activity oftheVCP is
closely associated with increased lifespan. A
decreased amount ofT3intissues during aging
corresponds todecreasing mitochondrial functon.
Increased C02 inhibits the formation of
lactate, decreases thelipolytic effect ofadrenaline,
and thelowered energy charge produced bythe
VCP would prevent thediversion ofglucose into
other uses.5
According tothe rate-of-living theory of
aging, the "post-mitotic" <:>rganism ages and
degenerates inproportion totherateatwhich it
metabolizes. Leonard Hayflick, todemonstrate
thatitiscelldivision, notthepassage oftime, that
ages cells, put some cells inafreezer, while
others, from thesame batch, were kept inawarm
incubatqr andallowed togothrough their allotted
.number ofdivisio:Q.s. When thewarm, growing
cells had approached 50replications and began
dying "ofoldage," theother cells were taken out
ofthefreezer, andthey were able todivide aswell
asthey hadbefore being frozen. Theimplication
wasthatslowing metabolism wastheonly way to
extend thelifespan.
These beliefs have allowed people toview the
metabolism, theturnover ofsubstance andcells,
ofatissue such asbone, asindicating breakdown,
weakening, and loss. For many years, it was
impossible toshow anybeneficial effect ofestro-
gen onthebones ofexperimental animals or
people, butthen itwas discovered that itcould
slow themetabolism oftheosteoclasts, reducing
therateofturnover inthebones. This waspropa-
gandistically effective.
The estrogen industry's funding greatly
reinforced therate-of-living theory ofaging, and
metabolic markers ofbone turnover began tobe
used tomeasure theeffects oftreatment. Thyroid
hormone (the active T3hormone) increases the
rateofturnover ofalltissues, including bone, so
byreference tothe"bone protective effects of
estrogen," theargUment was made that thyroid
supplementation should bereduced, toprevent
osteoporosis (despite animal studies showing that
T3increases bone development). Since hypothy-
roidism usually involves increased thyroid stimu-
lating hormone, TSH, theargument wasextended
byshowing thatTSH lowers bone turnover.
One factor involved intheincreased produc-
tiOIi ofTSH inhypothyroidism isthat thelow
metabolic rate allows estrogen toaccumulate,
leading to increased serotonin production.
Serotonin stimulates both TSH and prolactin.
Serotonin and prolactin both happen tocause
bone loss. They increase nitric oxide, which inhib-
itsmitochondrial respiration. Serotonin increases
acytokine, osteoprotegerin, that inhibits osteo-
clasts, reducing bone turnover. However,
serotonin's other antimetabolic effects outweigh
that effect, and itisamajor factor incausing
osteoporosis. The antimetabolic factors that slow
therateofliving alsoslow therateofrenewal, and
onbalance lead totissue atrqphy, fibrosis, inflam-
mation, and. degeneration. Several decades after
estrogen-induced prolactin might have been recog-
nized asacause ofbone loss inaging, afew
people arementioning themechanism inspecific
situations (Homer, 2009; Homer, etal.,2007).
With aging, metabolic activity and the
turnover ofbiological substance decrease. Organ-
elles such asmitochondria arerenewed every day
ortwo, much ofthe brain substance has a
similarly fastrateofturnover, andother parts of
thebody arerenewed more slowly. When condi-
tions areoptimal, thenew structures areflawless,
butunder thewrong conditions, faulty repairs can
accumulate, producing thedegenerative problems
ofaging.
Our culture's understanding ofbiology has
been shaped byaseries ofideologies, and
currently the drug industry isthe main force
shaping those ideologies, creating anattitude
that's receptive totheir products.
The huge marketing campaign forresveratrol
willhave direct effects onpeople's health, proba-
blyextending beyond thegeneration that uses it,
butitisalso polluting theculture byreinforcing
thedoctrine thattorpor, slowing thelifeprocess,
isbeneficial.
