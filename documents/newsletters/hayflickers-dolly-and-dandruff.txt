Box 5764, Eugene, OR 97405 several decades suggesting that there is no independent biological clock at all, but rather an ability of cells and organisms to perceive rhythmic environmental conditions. Frank A. Brown, Jr. (Univ. of Indiana) and Alexandre Rothen (Rockefeller Univ.) devised many experiments that clearly demonstrated that biochemical, metabolic and physiological rhythms are responsive to cues other than light and darkness. The geomagnetic field is one type of cue that has demonstrable biological effects. The doctrine of a genetic clock causing aging denies the role of environmental factors in the aging process. Cigarette companies argued that "we don't know the cause of cancer, so go ahead and smoke." The genetic clock people claim to know the cause of aging, and that it is not environmental factors. Hayflickers, Dolly & dandruff: The "telomeric clock" is not a valid theory of aging. The roles of nutrition, estrogen, and progesterone in stress-related energy problems:  A meaningful pattern for all organisms. Besides the commercially promoted idea that melatonin has something to do with a "biological clock," there are two main doctrines among biologists about the nature of the clock that they suppose exists. One group argues that a group of/ brain cells called the suprachiasmatic nucleus has a regular rate of firing that is "determined by genes" and that controls biological rhythms. Unfortunately for that theory, the firing rate of "Estrogen's identity as a shock-hormone gives an insight into the context-dependent aging of cells and carcinogenesis. The pro-respiratory progesterone is involved as estrogen's antagonist at the deepest molecudar levels." "The stem cell is defined as that cell in a tissue which, under normal circumstances, maintainsits own population, undiminished in function and size, and furnishes daughters to provide new functional cells of that tissue. The daughters may, or may not, have to udergo further differentiation and/or maturation in order to achieve their functional stage. The fundamental characteristic of a stem cell, therefore, is selfrenewal. Evidence is presented which implicates the microenvironment as a major component of the stem cell system, without which stem cells cannot be maintained. Furthermore, it is suggested that stem cell properties do not reside in one specific cell type in the population but, when necessary, cells other than those normally playing the stem cell role, can have stem cell function imposed upon them by the appropriate microenvironment. The stem cell "niche" hypothesis is presented to explain the dependence of stem cells upon their microenvironment. The postulate is offered that there are no cells which are intrinsically stem cells but that a range of cells in a tissue possess stem cell potential to a greater or lesser extent." "The stem cell system," R. Schofield, Biomed Pharmacother, 1983, 37:8, 375-80. those cells turns out to be variable under different conditions of metabolism and temperature (Ruby and Heller, 1996). Another general kind of clock is proposed to A be "determined by the genes," or genetically "programmed," and in this case the clock is supposed to determine how long an animal can live. Neither of these groups has even tried to dispose of the facts that have accumulated over

Studies of the rate of cell division in the lining of the intestine and of the bone marrow cells that continuously produce red blood cells throughout the life-span also have shown gross violations of the "Hayflick limit." Dandruff, the result of the steady division of cells in the epidermis, and the growth of nails and hair, are easily visible demonstrations that Hayflick's observations were just the result of the special conditions he created in his cell culture bottles. The gradual accumulation of support for the principles Carrel outlined inciudes evidence that cell-to-cell interactions (R. Auerbach, 1972), adequacy of glucose supply, oxygen and carbon dioxide, appropriate pH, osmolarity, hormones, extracellular matrix (Gospodarowicz), hormones, and many regulatory substances including proteins and fats, can fundamentally change the ability of cells to divide in culture vessels. For example, Gospodarowicz, et al. (1983) found that growing cells on "extracellular matrix," and with some natural substances from serum, plasma.") rather than on plastic, made the difference between an in vitro longevity of 15 or 24 divisions, and "at least 88" cell divisions. If the "intrinsic cell aging" people want to talk in terms of "programming," then we would have to say that cells are con.stantly open to "reprogramming," which is to say that they are perceptive and responsive to their environment. Hayflick's method began with tissue that could rule that it is inaccurate to speak of a rule. be kept, either at room temperature or at 5 degrees, "for at least 5 days" (and "up to 3 weeks") "without apparent loss of viability." Although the people normally don't. lactic acid production is a sign of stress, it seems that Hayflick took it as an indication of life: "Once the cultures have become confluent cell sheets, the cells are very active metabolically, as shown by the fact that the GM [growth medium] in the same cell. becomes acid faster than in cultures of heteroploid cell lines inoculated with the same number of cells." "Although mitotic activity eventually ceases in the culture, acid production continues; and as dictated by drops in the pH, cultures can be ed â€“ rell mied pon through depend by for sluck, Dioli's letter PH, Gozingrou mativ, in itio fed for a few months until all acid production ceases and the culture is observed to have completely degenerated." Among the ridiculously antiphysiological conditions used in Haflick's experiments was the addition of high concentrations of penicillin and streptomycin, or aureomycin, to the growth medium. (See Pershadang, et al., 1982.) He refers to Carrel's techniques as "primitive," and says "In any event, Carrel's experiment has never been confirmed." (Carrel's experiment continued for 35 years, so it will be a while before anyone repeats it.) Carrel's "primitive" method involved frequent addition of chick embryo extract rather than Hayflick's commercial solutions of salts, buffers, and antibiotics, with the addition of very small amounts of calf or horse serum. Using fluids from the same species, from an embryo rather than from an adult, and avoiding harmful additives, might be more properly called a sophisticated technique, rather than primitive incompetence. (Smith, et al., 1985, showed that DNA "repair capacity was always found to be greatest in medium supplemented with autologous plasma.") The essence of the telomeric clock doctrine is that the telomere shortens with aging, making cell division impossible, and causing the organism to suffer the symptoms of aging, while the "immortal germ cells and cancer cells" have active telomerase that allows them to maintain long telomeres. Besides the "inappropriate" telomere length that has been seen in some individuals of different ages, there are so many exceptions to the rule that it is inaccurate to speak of a rule. Mice, with a very short life-span, have active telomerase in their body tissues, while Telomerase isn't the people normally don't. needed to form or maintain telomeres. Some cancers have long telomeres, some don't. Telomere length varies between organs in the same animal, and even between chromosomes in the same cell. To say that the theory of the telomeric-mitotic clock is complete junk is not to question the importance of the telomere itself-like any part of the cell, it is complex, important, and interesting. 
IV. DNA, stress, and estrogen
 big step to go from "stress hormone" to "age hormone." Estrogen is beginning to lose its false identity as the "female hormone," which was always just a promotional concept of the pharmaceutical industry. Hundreds of false claims have been made about estrogen's "youth promoting" effects, but they always turn out to be the opposite of what is claimed. For example, "estrogen increases the collagen content of skin," but in fact collagen accumulation is characteristic of aging, radiation injury, and many other types of damage. "Estrogen makes the skin plumper," but it is by causing water retention; bloating might stretch wrinkly skin until it is smooth, or even tight, but a swollen old face is, if anything, biologically older than a lean and creased face. (I have discussed many other such advertising ploys in my books, e.g., From PMS to Menopause: Hormones in Context.) identity as the "female hormone," which was If Hayflick and Carrel have anything in always just a promotional concept of the pharmacommon, it is the observation that aging is closely ceutical industry. Hundreds of false claims have associated with the slowing of cell division. been made about estrogen's "youth promoting" Carrel's observation that the rate of healing is effects, but they always turn out to be the opposite slower in old individuals has been repeated in of what is claimed. For example, "estrogen different systems, for example (Lambert, et al., increases the collagen content of skin," but in fact 1979) showing that DNA repair synthesis is collagen accumulation is characteristic of aging, retarded in cells from old people. Estrogen also radiation injury, and many other types of damage. slows DNA repair (O'Brien, 1993), as well as "Estrogen makes the skin plumper," but it is by causing increased DNA breakage. causing water retention; bloating might stretch Estrogen's identity as a shock-hormone gives wrinkly skin until it is smooth, or even tight, but a an insight into the context-dependent aging of swollen old face is, if anything, biologically older cells and carcinogenesis.

"Data and arguments are presented that provide evidence of a role played by thyroid hormones (TH) in cell reliability improvement. This role may be determined by synergistic TH action on the following key cell reliability systems: (1) reactive oxygen species (ROS) attack inhibition, and (2) genetic structure repair from injuries inflicted in the course of endogenous and induced mutagenesis. (1) New approaches to ROS oxidation defence were examined. It has been shown that Ca(2+)-ATPase and, probably, regulatory proteins of cell membranes may be the main target for oxidative attack. Protein phosphorylation as well as use of dithiothreitol will lead to a protective action against Ca2+ transport damaging in aorta smooth muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum under oxidation by HOCl, the most toxic ROS of activated neutrophils, whereas thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) validly inhibit chemiluminescence in human neutrophils activated by pyrogenal, a lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella typhi cell wall. As this takes place, TH most likely block neutrophil stimulation at the receptor-ligand interaction level. In this case L-T4 and L-T3 antioxidative effect is greater than that of DL-thyroxine and much greater than that produced by such a potent antioxidant as 4-methyl-2,6-diisobutyl phenol. (2) T4 acts as reparogen in rat liver cells uder X-ray irradiation when a dose measuring one-half of daily hormone production by the normally functioning thyroid gland is administered to animals. Ionizing radiation dose reduction factor reached 1.3-1.4 following T4 administration. Reparogenic effect of T4 persists for at least 2 months from the moment the hormone has been administered and can be reduced in the presence of dinitrophenol. It is important to note that antioxidant and reparogenic TH potential can manifest itself within the range of physiologic concentrations of these hormones. Therefore, stimulation of cell reliability systems with TH may prove to be important for correcting conditions caused by errors in energyand Ca(2+)-dependent DNA repair under extensive ROS attack. In particular, taking into account different responsiveness of normal and neoplastic tissues to TH, the use of TH reparogenic as well as antioxidant potential may contribute significantly to the improvement of antitumor radiotherapy efficacy.

Focal areas of cytochrome oxidase negativity, resembling those in skeletal muscle fibres in patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) syndromes, appear in old age.

"In the aging mammalian hypothalamus, a unique subpopulation of glial cells accumulates peroxidase-positive cytoplasmic inclusions distinct from lipofuscin. In adult rodents, this senescence-dependent glial granulation is accelerated by administration of estradiol valerate. In the present study, brain sections derived from male rats given 3 monthly intramuscular injections of estradiol valerate (0.2 mg or 2.0 mg) were immunostained for heat shock proteins and glial fibrillary acidic protein to determine whether a glial stress response is implicated in estrogen-induced granulation. Our findings indicate that estrogen elicits a heat shock response and subsequent granulation in astrocytes residing in estradiol receptor-rich brain regions including the arcuate nucleus and the wall surrounding the third ventricle but not in estradiol receptor-deficient regions such as the striatum and corpus callosum. The heat shock proteins induced by estrogen, namely, the 27, 72, and 90 kDa stress proteins, are upregulated in astrocytes in response to oxidative challenge supporting our hypothesis that estrogen mediates senescent changes in the rodent hypothalamus through oxidative mechanisms."

The omission of any of these three factors from the synthetic medium results in a lower growth rate of the cultures, as well as in a lower final cell density once cultures reach confluence. When cells are plated in the total absence of serum, transferrin (10 micrograms/ml) is also required to induce optimal cell growth. The effects of the substrate and medium supplements on the life span of VSM cultures have also been analyzed. Cultures maintained on plastic and exposed to medium supplemented with 5% bovine serum underwent 15 generations. However, when maintained on ECM-coated dishes the serum-fed cultures had a life span of at least 88 generations. Likewise, when cultures were maintained in a synthetic medium supplemented with HDL and either FGF or EGF, an effect on the tissue culture life span by the substrate was observed. Cultures maintained on plastic underwent 24 generations, whereas those maintained on ECM-coated dishes could be passaged repeatedly for 58 generations. These experiments demonstrate the influence of the ECM-substrate only in promoting cell growth but also in increasing the longevity of the cultures."

"Airway epithelial cells cultured at the air-liquid interface possess highly differentiated functions and structures compared with the cells cultured under immersion. We examined the oxidative metabolism and glycolysis in cow tracheal epithelial cells on Days 3, 6, 10, and 13, cultured under three different conditions: (1) immersion culture on porous filters with apical and basolateral feeding (IM), (2) air-exposed culture on porous filters with basolateral feeding, i.e., air-liquid interface culture (AI), and (3) conventional immersion culture in plastic dishes with apical feeding (DI). Lactate production was less in AI than in IM and DI on Day 3 through Day 13, whereas cellular adenosine triphosphate content and basal O2 consumption were greater. Ouabain-sensitive and ouabain-insensitive 02 consumption, and the uncoupled 02 consumption were also greater in Al. Cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase activities on Day 10 were lower in AJ, whereas alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activities were higher. The increased oxidative metabolism in AI was more pronounced at the late phase of culture (Days 10 and 13). In contrast, glycolysis remained elevated during the experiment in IM and DI. These data suggest that (I) AI begins to promote oxidative metabolism from growth phase by the provision of adequate oxygenation, and then further shifts to oxidative metabolism with differentiation; and (2) apical feeding may be responsible for the disturbance of the development of the oxidative metabolism."

At early passage both cultural and cellular morphology were similar, although the vacuole content in wtHSP27 was much higher than muHSP27 cells. As the cultures aged, wtHSP27 cells became large, polymorphic, highly vacuolated, and reached senescence before muHSP27 transfected cultures, which remained small and polygonal with few detectable vacuoles. Vector control cells showed an intermediate phenotype. Tritiated thymidine incorporation studies were performed with multiple wtHSP27 and muHSP27 clones and the results compared with 11 vector control clones. The results showed an average increase in growth rate for the wtHSP27 cells of 3.0 +/- 0.6 times. The growth rate of eight muHSP27 clones showed a slight decrease. Estradiol treatment of endothelial cells resulted in an increase in both bovine and human HSP27, with peak expression at 100 nM.

"The isolation of Xenopus liver, lung and testis cells by collagenase digestion of the tissue, followed by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, was characterized by the preferential synthesis of two proteins whose size and charge were similar to 70 and 85 kD heat-shock proteins. The synthesis of these two heat-shock-like proteins, relative to that of total protein, declined gradually in the first 3-4 days after the cells were plated out for primary culture. In fresh primary cultures of liver parenchymal cells albumin mRNA concentration declined rapidly and plateaued at 3-4 days of culture. Freshly isolated male Xenopus hepatocytes were refractory to induction by estrogen of vitellogenin gene transcription but they reacquired hormonal response during the first 3 days of culture. Both of these differentiated phenotypic functions of the Xenopus hepatocytes were quantitatively associated with the decline in synthesis of hsp-like proteins in freshly prepared primary cell cultures. Freshly isolated or heat-shocked hepatocytes exhibited a rounded shape with little intercellular contacts, whereas during the recovery period of 3 days they acquired a flattened shape with a high degree of intercellular and cell-substratum interaction. These results present the first evidence for the preferential synthesis of heat-shock-like proteins by procedures for establishing primary cell cultures. They emphasize the necessity of monitoring normal and heatshock protein synthesis and cell morphology before using primary cell cultures for studying normal regulatory and developmental processes. 11 Wu WX, Derks JB, Zhang Q, Nathanielsz PW, Endocrinology 1996 137(12):5685-5693 "Changes in heat shock protein-90 and -70 messenger ribonucleic acid in uterine tissues of the ewe in relation to parturition and regulation by estradiol and progesterone," "Steroid receptors, including estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), form associations with heat shock proteins (Hsps). Dissociation of Hsps activates PR, whereas retention of Hsp90 in vitro stimulates ER. Progesterone and estrogen, interacting with their receptors, regulate myometrial contractility throughout pregnancy and during parturition. We hypothesize that uterine ER and PR changes concurrent with changes in Hsp90 and -70 abundance could alter uterine function." "Dramatic tissue-specific increases in Hsp90 and -70 mRNA were observed in myometrium and endometrium (P < 0.05) during spontaneous and glucocorticoid-induced labor. Hsp90 and -70 mRNA localized in myometrial, arterial smooth muscle, and endometrial gland epithelial cells. Estradiol increased Hsp90 and -70 mRNA in myometrium and endometrium of nonpregnant ewes. Progesterone did not affect Hsp90 and -70 mRNA abundance, but inhibited the estradiol-stimulated increase. These data support our hypothesis that at term, increased abundance of Hsp90 and -70 may inhibit uterine PR and stimulate ER function in uterine tissues. Similar changes, if present, would be of importance in species showing no progesterone withdrawal before labor, such as primates, including pregnant women." Zeman EM, Pearson CI, Brown JM, Radiat Res 1990; 122(1):72-76, "Induction of hypoxia in glass versus Permanox petri dishes," "The survival of Chinese hamster ovary cells in culture following graded doses of X rays delivered under aerobic and hypoxic conditions, or treatment with the bioreductive drug SR 4233 under hypoxic conditions, was evaluated as a function of whether cells were plated onto glass or Permanox plastic petri dishes. In the case of treatment with SR 4233, the influence of varying the total volume of medium in the dishes was also studied. While the Permanox petri dishes were sufficient to yield "radiobiological" hypoxia, that is, oxygen enhancement ratios of approximately 3.0 were obtained for X irradiation, they were inferior to glass petri dishes with respect to the hypoxia-selective cytotoxicity of SR 4233. For a 90-min hypoxic exposure to 40 microM SR 4233, the surviving fraction of cells plated on plastic dishes averaged about 50-fold higher than that of cells plated on glass dishes. Although varying the total medium volume did affect the extent of SR 4233-induced cytotoxicity for glass dishes-drug toxicity decreased slightly with increasing medium volume--this was not the case for the plastic dishes, in which the cell survival following a fixed SR 4233 exposure was essentially constant as a function of medium volume. These results suggest, at least for SR 4233, and under these experimental conditions, that Permanox petri dishes are not satisfactory for such studies. "
