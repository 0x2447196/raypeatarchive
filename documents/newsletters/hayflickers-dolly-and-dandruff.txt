lously antiphysiological conditions used in
Haflick's experiments was·the addition ofhigh
concentrations of-pemctlhn andstreptomycin, or
aureomycin, tothegroWth medium. (See Persha-
dang, etaI., 1982.) He refers toCarrel's
techniques as"primitive," andsays "Inanyevent,
Carrel's experiment hasnever been confirmed."
(Carrel's experiment continued for35years, soit
will beawhile before anyone repeats it.)
Carrel's "primitive" method involved frequent

Theessence ofthetelomeric clock doctrine is
thatthetelomere shortens with aging, making cell
division impossible, andcausing theorganism to
suffer thesymptoms ofaging, while the"immor-
talgerm cells and cancer cells" have active
telomerase that allows them to.maintain long
telomeres. Besides the"inappropriate" telomere
length that hasbeen seen insome individuals of
different ages, there aresomany exceptions tothe
rulethatitisinaccurate tospeak ofarule.
Mice, with avery short life-span, have
active telomerase intheir body tissues, while
people normally don't. Telomerase isn't
needed toform ormaintain telomeres. Some
cancers have long telomeres, some don't.
Telomere length varies between organs inthe
same animal, and even between chromosomes
inthesame cell.
Tosaythatthetheory ofthetelomeric-mitotic
clock iscomplete junk isnottoquestion the
importance ofthetelomere itself--like anypartof.

Studies oftherateofcelldivision inthelining
oftheintestine andofthebone marrow cells that
continuously produce redblood cells throughout
thelife-span also have shown gross violations of
the"Hayflick limit." Dandruff, theresult ofthe
steady division ofcells intheepidermis, andthe
growth ofnails andhair, areeasily visible demon-
strations thatHayflick's observations were just.the
result ofthespecial conditions hecreated inhis
cellculture bottles.
The gradual accumulation ofsupport forthe
principles Carrel outlined includes evidence that
cell-to-cell interactions (R. Auerbach, 1972),
adequacy ofglucose supply, oxygen and carbon
dioxide, appropriate pH, osmolarity, hormones,
extracellular matrix (Gospodarowicz), hormones,
andmany regulatory substances including proteins
andfats, can fundamentally change theability
ofcells todivide inculture vessels.
For example, Gospodarowicz, etaI.(1983)
found thatgrowing cells on"extracellular matrix,"
and with some natural substances (torn serum,
!!lther than on plastic, made the difference
between an in vitro longevity of15or24
divisions, and"atleast 88"celldivisions.
Hthe"intrinsic cellaging" people want to
talk interms of"progranimingt" then we
would have tosay that cells are
open to"reprogramming," which is'to saythat
.tliey are perceptive and responsive totheir
environment.
Hayflick's method began with tissue thatcould
bekept, either atroom temperature orat5
degrees, "foratleast 5days" (and "upto3weeks")
[;withOut apparent loss .ofviability." Although
lactic acid production isasign ofstress, itseems
that Hayflick took itasanindication oflife:
"Once thecultures have become confluent cell
sheets, thecells arevery active metabolically, as
shown bythefact that theGM [growth medium]
becomes acid faster than incultures ofhetero-
ploid celllines inoculated with the number
ofcells." "Although mitotic activity eventually

increase ingrowth rate forthewtHSP27 cells of3.0
+/-0,6times. The growth rate ofeight muHSP27
clones showed aslight decrease. Estradiol treatment
ofendothelial cells resulted inanincrease inboth
bovine and human HSP27, with peak expression at
100oM. Treatment ofthevector-transfected cells with
100 nM estradiol resulted ina1.44 +/-0.18 fold
increase ingrowth rate, which was blocked byexpres-
sion ofmuHSP27. These data demonstrate arole
for HSP27 incontrolling the growth rate of
endothelial cells in an estrogen-responsive
manner."

ofheat-shock-Iike proteins infresh primary cell
cultures." "The isolation ofXenopus liver, lung and
testis cells bycollagenase digestion ofthetissue,
followed byPercoll density gradient centrifugation,
wascharacterized bythepreferential oftwo
proteins whose size and charge were siinilar to70
and 85kDheat-shock proteins. The synthesis of
these two heat-shock-like proteins, relative tothatof
total protein, declined gradually inthefirst 3-4days
after thecells were plated outforprimaIy culture. In
fresh primary cultures ofliver parenchymal cells
albumin mRNA concentration declined rapidly and
plateaued at3-4days ofculture. Freshly isolated male
Xenopus hepatocytes were refractory toinduction by
estrogen ofvitellogenin gene transcription butthey
reacquired hormonal response during thefirst3days of
culture. Both ofthese differentiated phenotypic
functions oftheXenopus hepatocytes were quantita-
tively associated With the decline insynthesis of
hsp-like proteins infreshly prepared primary cell
cultures. Freshly isolated orheat-shocked hepatocytes
.exhibited arounded shape with little intercellular
contacts, whereas during therecovery period of3days
they acquired aflattened shape with ahigh degree of
intercellular and cell-substratum interaction. These
results present thefirst evidence forthepreferential
synthesis ofheat-shock-Iike proteins by,procedures

acid inuterine tissues oftheewe inrelation toparturi-

"Steroid receptors, including estrogen receptor (ER)
and progesterone receptors (PR), form associations
with heat shock proteins (Hsps). Dissociation ofHsps
activates PRo whereas retention ofHsp90 invitrostimulates ER. Progesterone andestrogen, interacting
with their receptors, regulate myometrial contractility
throughout pregnancy and during parturition. We
hypothesize that uterine ERand PRchanges concur-
rent with changes inHsp90 and-70abundance could
alter uterine function." "Dramatic tissue-specific
increases inHsp90 and-70mRNA were observed in
myometrium and endometrium (P<0.05) during
spontaneous andglucocorticoid-induced labor. Hsp90
and -70 mRNA localized inmyometrial, arterial
smooth muscle, andendometrial gland epithelial cells.
Estradiol increased Hsp90 and -70 mRNA in
myometrium and endometrium ofnonpregnant ewes.
Progesterone didnotaffect Hsp90 and -70mRNA
abundance, but inhibited the estradiol-stimulated
increase. These data support ourhypothesis that at
term, increased abundance ofHsp90 and -70may
inhibit uterine PRandstimulate ERfunction inuterine
tissues, Similar changes, ifpresent, would beof

versus Permanox petri dishes," ''The survival of
Chinese hamster ovary celis inculture following
graded doses ofXrays delivered under aerobic and
hypoxic conditions, ortreatment with thebioreductive
drug SR4233 under hypoxic conditions, was'evaluated
asafunction ofwhether cells were plated onto glass or
Permanox plastic petri dishes. Inthecase oftreatment
with SR4233, the influence ofvarying thetotal
volume ofmedium inthedishes was also studied.
While thePermanox petri dishes were sufficient to
yield "radiobiological" hypoxia, that is,oxygen
enhancement ratios ofapproximately 3.0 were
obtained forXirradiation, they were inferior toglass
petri dishes with respect tothehypoxia-selective
cytotoxicity ofSR 4233. For a90-min hypoxic
exposure to40microM SR 4233, the surviving
fraction ofcells plated onplastic dishes averaged
about' 50-fold higher than thatofcells plated onglass
dishes. Although varying thetotal medium volume did
affect theextent ofSR4233-induced cytotoxicity for
glass dishes--drug toxicity decreased slightly with
increasing medium volume-this was notthecase for
theplastic dishes, inwhich thecellsurvival following
afixed SR4233 exposure wasessentially constant asa
function ofmedium volume. These results suggest, at
least forSR4233, andunder these experimental condi-
tions, that Permanox petri dishes arenotslltisfactory
forsuch studies. "
