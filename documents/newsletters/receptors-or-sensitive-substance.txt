Receptors, or Sensitive
Substance?
The major science journals avoid publish-
ing things that aren’t compatible with thecurrent belief system, so the facts that supportthe principles taught in the universities areundeniably “cherry picked,” first by editors,and then by professors.  The journals’ editorsare hired for their ability to make selectionsthat will add to and expand the established“scientific knowledge,” but since they aren’tomniscient, their choices sometimes inadver-tently provide glimpses o f another, more inter-
esting, world of knowledge.  The solutions tosome of the perennial p roblems of biology and
medicine are taking shape in that otherculture. Some of the best known ideas ofbiology—including genes, membranes andreceptors—have blocked, and continue toblock, understanding of aging, cancer, stress,shock, epilepsy, regener ation, perception, and
thinking.
Mainstream science, the “official” science
that is massively financed by government andindustry, has been elaborating an ideologybased on a metaphysical view of matter, assomething known a priori.  A different,
experience-based science, which isn’tcommitted to a particular doctrine about thenature of matter, has barely managed tosurvive into the present  century in the work of
a few scattered individuals. While mainstream science has been
committed to a “mechanistic” view of biology(e.g., Francis Crick’s “what is there besidesatoms?”), the empirical investigators havetaken a more global view of living things,recognizing that new properties emerge innew situations, and that these situation-dependent properties can’t be understood in
terms of the physical principles that weresufficient for understanding steam engines.   
Some of the best known
ideas of biology--includinggenes, membranes and recep-tors—have blocked, andcontinue to block, understand-ing of aging, cancer, stress,shock, epilepsy, regeneration,perception, and thinking.
Embryologists began seeing the relevance
of principles of long range ordering, as can beseen in liquid crystals and coacervates. Inrecent times, some of these properties ofcomplex matter have turned out to be usefulin new technologies, including electronicdisplays and drug formulation, and that has tosome extent validated their reconsideration inbiology.  However, the opposing, mechanisticview has been building its doctrines and insti-tutions for more than a century, and they arestabilized by the annual flow of trillions ofRay Peat's Newsletter

Early in his career, Paul Ehrlich observed
that certain dyes selectively stained certaintypes of cell, without coloring other cells, andin the 1890s he related that specificity to EmilFisher’s description of enzyme action on asubstrate as a lock a nd key interaction of
specific chemical compounds, and proposedthat cells contain chemical “side-chains” thatspecifically bound the dye. The fact of differ-ing affinities of substances is something thatcontinues to be studied, and that rarelyinvolves anything like Ehrlich’s theory, butthe spirit of the times, and the power of theGerman chemical industry, put Ehrlich’s ideain the foreground of medical culture.
The assumption of randomness is
an integral part of a larger systemof interlocking assumptions--geneticdeterminism, barrier membranes,random diffusion, osmosis, recep-tors, channels, and pumps. Thoseare simple concepts to learn, andwhen they are reinforced by yearsof “education,” they are very hardto question.
    I n  1900, Ehrlich substituted the word
“receptor” for “side-chain.” His idea of theside-chain-receptor on cells was that it couldbe produced in excess, as a defensiveantitoxin, neutralizi ng toxins by binding to
them. That part of his theory was a rough butrealistic description of the process of naturalimmunity. He also claimed that his aniline-based dyes were staining and killing microbesbecause they were a specific chemical matchfor the microbe; when a dye failed to kill amicrobe, he chemically attached the aniline toarsenic, claiming that this would cause thearsenic to be selectively bound to specificreceptors on the microbe, sparing the patient’scells. That mistaken belief has continued to
exist in popular culture, and still guides themedical approach to cancer treatment.
Ehrlich’s newer magic bullet chemother-
apy, arsphenamine or Salvarsan, was toxic tohuman tissue. It was claimed that it causeddeath only when it was mistakenly injectedinto muscle rather than into a vein. InGermany there was public hostility towardEhrlich, the Frankfurt hospital, and theHoechst company that made Salvarsan. Thecritics objected to the compulsory administra-tion of the dangerous drug to prostitutes, andclaimed that Ehrlich a nd Hoechst were enrich-
ing themselves by charging high prices for adrug developed with government funding.Karl Wassman, the editor of a Frankfurtnewspaper making those criticisms, wasconvicted of insulting Ehrlich and sentencedto a year in prison.
The pharmacologist Walther Straub
argued against Ehrlich’s specific chemicalinteractions between receptors and drugs,thinking of the physical  properties of drugs
and hormones as being able to explain theantagonistic effects and generality of action ofa wide range of pharmacologically activesubstances. Ehrlich believed* that physical
chemistry didn’t apply to biology, and hisattitude, encouraged by the drug industry, haspersisted in official science up to the present.Physics and chemistry had become StateSciences by the end of the 18th century, andwith Ehrlich, biology became a CommercialScience. 
Straub’s orientation toward the physical
properties of drugs and hormones reflected animportant strain of scientific culture of histime, that was widely known because of thefamous embryological research of JacquesLoeb. Loeb demonstrated that the specificbiological stimulus of a sperm cell, interactingwith a “receptor” in the egg, wasn’t needed tofertilize an egg; sea water, with added salt orsugar or urea, or acid or alkali, was enough to2trigger the process of embryonic development .
The activating signal was non-localized, apervasive change in the cell water.
The possibility of extending
the period of development, delay-ing or eliminating aging andrestoring normal differentiationto cancerous tissue, grew out ofthe work of the experimentalembryologists who saw theimportance of investigating thephysical-chemical properties ofthe living substance itself.
Ehrlich’s “lock and key” theory, that all
cells are covered with receptors specific fornutrients and toxins, overlaps considerablywith the preformationist view that inheritedstructures in the nucleus are in control of thedevelopmental process. The embryologistswho thought in biophysical  terms opened the
way to the idea of morphogenetic fields andthe epigenetic nature of development.Biophysical thinking led them to think interms of biological “fields,” and their lock andkey opponents dismissed them as “vitalists.” 
The possibility of extending the period of
development, delaying or eliminating agingand restoring normal differentiation to cancer-ous tissue, grew out of the work of the experi-mental embryologists who saw the importanceof investigating the physical-chemical proper-
ties of the living substance itself. 
From the 1930s to the 1950s, the steroid
hormones and their physiological effects werebeing studied in objectiv e biophysical ways, at
the same time that they were being convertedinto products by the pharmaceutical cartels.Their general properties, including anesthesia,inflammation, and carcinogenesis, wereconsidered in terms of universal, generalproperties of cells and tissues. Estrogen andthe chemicals of soot (polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons) were known to produceinflammation, atrophy, fibrosis, and cancer,and other steroids, especially progesteroneand pregnenolone, were known to protectagainst those effects. 
Alberte and Bernard Pullman were able to
demonstrate that it was the electronic proper-ties of the polycyclic molecules that wereresponsible for their carcinogenicity. Theycalled their work “quantum chemistry” or“quantum biochemistry,” but it involved(“holistically”) working out the way that theproperties of the parts of the molecule weregoverned by the properties of the wholemolecule, its size and shape. 
The (electronic) polarizability of a
molecule governs its adsorptive properties,the way it interacts with and influences the
molecules in its surroundings . The Pullmans’
approach to aromatic organic compoundscomplemented the work of the biophysical(“vitalist”) embryologists, who demonstratedthat the polarity of an embryo existed in itsparts as well as in the whole. This reflectionof the whole in the parts is denied by themechanists, and the denial is built into thebasic assumptions of their science.

a molecule governs its adsorptiveproperties, the way it interacts withand influences the molecules in itssurroundings.
One of the arbitrary or metaphysical
assumptions of the mech anists is that, in the
absence of specifically imposed order, derivedfrom genes, there is random disorder. One ofmy professors, Sidney Bernhard, simplycounted molecules carefully, and found thatthe metabolism of glucose involved a directpassing of substrate molecules from oneenzyme to the next—the cell doesn’t contain3enough substrate molecules for it to operate
by random diffusion. The historically deter-
mined assumption of randomness is an
integral part of a larger system of interlockingassumptions—genetic determinism, barriermembranes, random diffusion, osmosis,receptors, channels, and pumps. Those aresimple concepts to learn, and when they arereinforced by years of “education,” they are
very hard to question.
   The biophysical approach to cell physiol-
ogy recognizes that enzymes are sensitive totheir surroundings, and that they work inorganized systems. The source of that smooth,complex organization is  conventionally said to
be the result of the nat ural selection of random
variations over a period of a billion years.Experiments by Sidney Fox and others have
demonstrated that cell-like structures,composed of protein-like molecules, withenzyme-like catalytic functions, can beproduced from amino acids in a school labora-tory in an afternoon, because of the spontane-ous self-organizing tendency of matter. 
Coacervates, formed by mixtures of
polymers, spontaneously form structures;electron micrographs have shown that theseparate phases contain fine-textured, fibrousinternal structures. “Stress granules,” thatform in the cytoplasm under stress, are nowknown to be coacervates, formed by the inter-action of RNA and protein. Other cell organ-elles have the properties of spontaneouslyformed phases, and are sometimes called“membraneless organelles.”
The structure of a coacervate is sensitive to
small amounts of solutes in the water. Thewell known effects of ions on the structure ofwater govern its relative lipophilicity orlipophobicity, the energy involved in its inter-faces with lipids and lipid-like parts ofproteins and other macromolecules, and sogovern the structures of the macromolecules.The solutes in coacervates are analogous tothe “dopants” in semiconductormaterials—small amounts of a substance that
change the electronic properties of an other-wise insulating substance. Electromagneticfields, affecting the charged materials, signifi-cantly affect cellular coacervates, whether thefields are internally or externally produced.The constant energy fl ow produced by oxida-
tion and reduction is one of the cell’s impor-tant formative influences.
A “receptor” is a way to
imagine order being introduced
into an otherwise supposedly
random system of diffusing
molecules.
In oxygen deprivation, cells
take up water, and the “estrogenreceptors” behave as though theyhad been stimulated by estrogen,but without the estrogen molecule.
    The energetic processes of cells, governing
their form and function, are regulated byenzymes, so it’s important to know exactlyhow enzymes are regulated, especially howthey are organized so that each cell has acoordinated metabolic pattern. It was obviousthat hormones could modify the catalyticactions of enzymes, so various people investi-gated their possible roles as catalysts, withdirect involvement in the chemical action ofenzymes. The active thyroid hormone wasobserved to almost instantly increase cells’oxygen consumption, and estrogen as quickly
increases cells’ uptake of sugar andwater.  These changes are far too quick to bethe result of communication with the cellnucleus leading to the synthesis of newproteins. 
Evidence for a catalytic function of estro-
gen was produced by a group at the Univer-sity of Chicago (Talalay, et al., 1958) whoshowed that it acts in a “transhydrogenase”4process that can increase the cell’s reductive
and synthetic capacity, allowing reductiveequivalents to flow from NADH to NADP,which can support cell growth and replicationprocesses.  The reductive balance is an impor-tant cell organizing factor, for examplegoverning the conversion of the relativelyinactive estrone into the powerful estradiol.(This is where a vicious circle of excitation,fatigue, and degeneration often starts, thatrequires the intervention of stabilizingsubstances, such as carbon dioxide, thyroidhormone, sugar, and progesterone.)
However, soon after that demonstration,
Elwood Jensen (1962), who had been workingon poison gases, began promoting the doctrinethat hormones work only by activating genes,after binding to a receptor protein. The USAtomic Energy Commission provided himwith tritium, to radioactively label estrogenfor his studies, something which otherresearchers didn’t have access to at the time.He claimed that his radioactive estrogen wasnot metabolized in the uterus, and claimed that
he had demonstrated the “nonmetabolic nature
of estrogen action,” simply contradicting the
work of the enzymologists. 
The shift of interest from direct effects on
enzymes to action on genes by way of recep-tor proteins doesn’t seem logical, because noone had repeated Jensen’s experiment, andseveral different groups were describing estro-gen’s metabolic changes in the uterus. In1965, Jensen did another experiment, againusing a newly synthesized substance, the anti-estrogen, nafoxidine, which wasn’t generallyavailable, and which hadn’t been studiedenough to understand the mechanisms of its
actions. Referring to his work, he said :
“These results caused the demise
of the transhydrogenation hypoth-esis and convinced all but themost diehard enzymologists thatestradiol binds to a characteristiccomponent of target  cells to exertits physiological effect without
itself being chemically altered.”
I think it’s more likely that government
funding was shifted away from researchshowing catalytic and enzyme-modifyingeffects of hormones, to their preferred expla-nation in terms of receptor-controlled genes.The line of research that had been fruitful forseveral years quickly disappeared, and by thelate 1960s the receptor doctrine was beingtaught as the official doctrine. 
“The history of the great
events of this world is the historyof crime.” Voltaire .
Jensen’s claim that estrogen isn’t metabo-
lized in the uterus served to create the recep-tor dogma, but no one repeats that claim now,because it would seem ridiculous. His resultsand his claim are anomalies. Besides beingmetabolized in the uterus and other “target”tissues, estrogen and other hormones are nowwell known to be able to modify the activityof enzymes, without directly participating inthe reaction as a catalyst, and without actingfirst in the nucleus. 
Enzymes’ functions are affected by the
adjoining water, and that water is affected bydissolved substances. In a coacervate, as in asemiconductor, the properties of the wholecan be modified by the presence of a verysmall amount of a particular substance, the“dopant.”  While I was in graduate school, Ifrequently baked bread, and I began thinkingof the way water interacted with the wheatflour, as a parallel to the changes that thephysical-chemical embryologists hadproduced with various chemicals. I noticedthat the consistency of the dough changed
oddly when I added a variety of biologicallyactive chemicals; it would feel wetter with asmall amount of one substance, and drier witha similar amount of a different substance;sedatives and stimulants affected it in5opposite ways. The same amount of water can
feel very different, in slightly changedconditions.
The effects of estrogen can be produced in
a variety of ways, without the estrogenmolecule itself. An excess of intracellularwater, similar to the water that cells take upimmediately when stimulated by estrogen, isenough to imitate its effects. In oxygen depri-vation, cells take up water, and the “estrogenreceptors” behave as though they had beenstimulated by estrogen, but without the estro-gen molecule. Many different factors—x-rays,hypoglycemia, excess alkalinity, cyanide,cholera toxin—synergize with estrogen; theyobviously aren’t acting just upon the estrogenreceptors. 
A “receptor” is a way to imagine order
being introduced into an otherwise supposedly
random system of diffusing molecules.  The
behavior of the receptor proteins may be
parallel to, and crucial for, some of the events
in a cell, but even then, rather than explaining
what’s happening in the cell, attention to the
receptors is distracting attention from the real
processes that should be understood. 
Luca Turin’s work on olfaction
and pharmacology, the detectionof and response to molecularresonance, should be a model forthinking about the way cells andorganisms are.
    The mechanist’s tendency is to see the life
of a cell in terms of information, digital on-offsignals, whether a pro tein receptor is phospho-
rylated or not, reduced or oxidized, etc., andto visualize it as atoms  arranged in space. That
imagined cell may “perceive,” but it perceivesthe way a logician thinks—without melody oraroma or erotic meaning. We accept that wehave several distinct kinds of sense (taste,smell, sight, sound, pressure, temperature,vibration, pain, pleasure), but for the cell, thestimuli are transduced, reduced to generic,sometimes “digital,” signals. Luca Turin’swork on olfaction and pharmacology, thedetection of and response to molecularresonance, should be a model for thinkingabout the way cells and organisms
are.  Responsiveness or sensitivity is a
property of the living s ubstance that needs to
be explored without preconceptions, alongwith the other properties such as polarity andintentionality that guided the best research ofthe past.
