Some issues related tothestress ofwinter:
"Winter sickness" occurs when there isn't enough
daylight toallow ustorecover from nocturnal stress.
The stress related hormones riseatnight, and winter
nights arelong.
The inadequate light produces thyroid and
progesterone deficiencies.
Aprogesterone orthyroid deficiency, orestrogen
and polyunsaturateu fatexcess, serotonin to
increase. Cold, dark, and even minor stresses cause
increased serotonin.
The amino acid tryptophan can bemetabolized
intoserotonin, which canbeconverted into melatonin.
More than twenty years ago, tryptophan was
being promoted asasedative, even though itwas
known tobetheonly amino acid that iscarcinogenic.
Inexcess, itsuppresses thefunction ofthethyroid
gland. Aprotein deficiency releases tryptophan from
muscles.
A"serotonin deficiency" was often said tocause
depression. Hydroxy tryptophan (5-HTP) issold asa
serotonin precursor that issupposed toimprove mood.
Many kinds ofstress cause serotonin's activity to
increase.
Melatonin hasbeen sold asasleeping pill, longev-
itypill, and anticancer agent. Itsproduction inthe
body isstimulated bystress and darkness.
Light, especially red light, penetrates into the
body, and suppresses free radical activity and
activates thecrucial respiratory enzyme, cytochrome
oxidase, which isactivated bythyroid, and which is
inactivated bypoly;.;nsahln:ted fats.
Serotonin released from platelets causes blood
clotting and vascular spasms, and stimulates cell
division. Itand histamine aremediators ofinflamma-
tion that cause blood vessels toleak.
Serotonin ,triggers the release ofthe stress
ho'rmones, ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin.
People often gain weight during thewinter; inthe
farnorth, blood tryptophan iselevated inthewinter;
depressed women have' increased melatonin, alcohol
lowers melatonin; alcohol consumption isincreased by
darkness.
The use ofantiserotonin drugs inalleviating
stroke, hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, depres-
sion, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, lUpus (SLE), fibro-
sis,wheezing, and migraine suggests theimportance of
hyperserotonemia incausing disease.Postpartum, premenstrual, and
seasonal serotonin soaks: Hints
about aging, insomnia anddiabetes
When Iread, intheearly 1950s, about the
cyclical peaks ofmortality intheearly morning
hours andwinter months, thathadbeen evident in
actuarial tables foralong time, itwasn't hard to
accept that light was good forus,and that
darkness was harmful. "Chronobiology," the
awareness thatbiological responses aredependent
onthetime ofday, was firmly established bythe
1950s.
"...Tryptophan transport was increased
inthe major depressions and inthe
dysthymic disorders." D.Pringuey,' etal.,
1986.
"...Wepropose that there isahypersero-
tonergic state inthehippocampal formation
ofsome subjects with schizophrenia ...."
E.Scarr, D.L. Copolov, B.Dean, L.Rebecca.
"...ahyperserotonemic condition has
been documented inpreeclampsia."
Carrasco, etal.,2000.
"Both melatonin and serotonin were
potent inhibitors ofprogesterone release."
Schaeffer andSirotkin, 1997.
Beginning inthe1950s, when Iwould spend
thesummers working inthewoods, Inoticed
effects ofsunlight thatIdidn't understand, such as
theworsening ofacne inproportion totheamount
ofsunexposure, aswell asduring times ofstress.
In 1965, Inoticed that even incandescent light
exposure during the night could immediately
provoke myacne, soIrealized that ultraviolet
irritation wasn't the essential factor. First I
thought theeyes' consumption ofvitamin Amight
beresponsible, since taking additional vitamin A
would con..trol myacne, butthen Irealized thatan
extended photoperiod stimulated the sex
hormones, and that this increased demands for
vitamin A.
When Imoved tothe northern US from
Mexico in1965, Ibegan noticing other interesting
hormonal and nutritional effects relating tothe
seasons. Inthewinter of1966-67 Ibegan refer-
ring to"winter sickness" astheconsequence of
thehormonal changes produced byalack oflight
exposure. Women who moved from asunny
climate tocloudy Eugene, andwho often lived in
gloomy basement apartments while they were at
theuniversity, described premenstrual depression
and other symptoms that they had never experi-
c:1ced Many serious diseases had their
onset during these times oflight deprivation and
hormonal upset.
Isubmitted some ofmy observations on
winter sickness tovarious journals, anddidn't get
anyresponses from most oftheeditors, except for
occasional sarcastic remarks about how ridiculous
itistosuggest thatlight would have biological or
psychological effects onhumans.
Since 1966 Ihad been including adiscussion
oflight's effects inmyclasses onnutrition and
hormones and aging, and intheearly seventies I
began travelling around totalk tohealth-food,
alternative medicine, and church groups, and to
talk onoccasional radio and television programs,
where Iwould emphasize theimportance ofgood
light along with good nutrition. Ifound that the
general public, andespecially so-called "conserva-
tive" people, were remarkably receptive toideas
of interactions between organism arld
environment, and between mood and chemistry. I
think their receptiveness had todowith the
attitude called "paranoia," anattitude that hasits
positive features, asSalvador Dali observed.
Professional people, especially journal editors,
ontheother hand, seemed tosuffer from amental
rigidity that was thepolar opposite ofparanoia, a
belief that nothing was happening outside ofthe
setofbeliefs residing intheir own minds. This isa
psychiatric condition that can becalled "editor-
ness," orsimply "professionalism."
Although no journal or magazine had
responded favorably tomy articles onwinter
sickness and light therapy, some ofthose editors2
later began publishing similar observations by
themselves orothers, and by1985 "Seasonal
Affective Disorder" was becoming something like
a"movement," with people arguing about the
proper useof"light panels" andphase-shifting of
melatonin, and even direct supplementation of
melatonin. When itsfactors arereduced toa
minimum, usually two, anew thought can
sometimes penetrate into theprofessional mental-
ity,though they arelikely' togetone orboth of
those factors wrong, asoften asnot. The useof
bright light totreat depression should have made
people realize that amelatonin excess contributed
todepression, butthatsimple idea hasbeen gener-
allyevaded.
The reluctance toseeanyconnection between
mood andhormones, orbetween light andhealth,
probably resulted from aneducation inwhich
there was already anexplanation foreverything.
Now that medicine accepts arole forlight and
hormones inmood and behavior, itiswithin a
culture dominated by Estrogen Replacement
Therapy andSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibi-
tors, such asProzac. When there isaproduct for
everything, explanations aredegraded, andprofes-
sionalism reaches anew low. The useofProzac
and similar drugs totreat PMS isanexample of
how product-professionalism works. (Itsaction in
PMS isprobably theresult ofincreasing abrain
steroid, compensating for aprogesterone
deficiency, exactly contrary tothedoctrine that it
actsbyincreasing serotonin availability.)
People who believe that there isa"biological
clock" inthebrainÂ· think that light signals entering
through theeyeprovide thecues thatsettheclock,
and that thebrain then organizes thebehavior
that's appropriate fortheseason andtime ofday.
But pigeons wearing opaque hoods can sense
environmental light iftherest oftheir body is
uncovered. The same sort ofbodily sensitivity to
light was demonstrated byshining light onto the
back ofaperson's knee.
Instead ofa"clock" that consists ofsome
procedure forcounting enzyme reactions orDNA
oscillations orsomething ofthesort, forwhich
there isnot even aclear theory, Ithink the
evidence supports the idea that physiological
states reflect the organism's relation tothe
environment, andthat, intheabsence oftheneces-
sary amount oflight and heat from theenviron-
ment, energy stores inthe. form ofglycogen
become depleted, creating hunger andavariety of
stress reactions. Ittakes some time todeplete
glycogen stores, and ittakes time toassimilate
food, andsohunger andsatiation tend tobecyclic,
butitisn't productive tocall these processes "a
biological clock."
Mitochondria change their shape andfunction
during thenight, becoming radically lesseffective
atproducing energy. Light regenerates thecrucial
cytochrome oxidase enzyme, creating theenergy
needed torepair mitochondria. During darkness,
glycogen stores intheliver, brain andother tissues
areused rapidly, because ofthemitochondrial
respiratory inefficiency. Fats aremobilized from
storage under theinfluence ofadrenalin thatrises
when glucose isscarce. Rapid eye movement
sleep, the phase ofactive dreaming, increases with
hunger, and the arousal subsides cyclically as
adrenalin issuppressed byother adjustments,
including increased cortisol, melatonin, GABA,
and many other regulatory substances and
processes.
Light suppresses melatonin andserotonin, but
itsaction isbiological and biochemical, notjust
informational--it's acomponent ofourmetabo-
lism, notjust a"cue." Our biological rhythms, of
approximately 24hoUrs, dohave alearned compo-
nent, butFrank A.Brown's experiments inthe
1960s made itclear thatthere areimportant rhyth-
micenvironmental influences other than thecycle
oflight anddark. Brown's biological experiments
were complemented byAlexandre Rothen's physi-
calexperiments which made itclear that the
diurnal cycles aren't justlight cues. Intheuniver-
sity's hamster house where-! worked, thecycles of
light and dark were automatically controlled, air
temperature was kept constant, andthere were no
windows, butinthewinter thehamsters' thymus
glands practically disappeared, and then inthe
summer they were restored. The infrared and
microwave radiation oftheenvironment, thatcan
penetrate walls, must beconstant toavoid biologi-
calstress.3
Winter, atleast insome species, causes
serotonin toincrease. (Philo andReiter, 1980) In
the winter, and inthe morning, intraocular
pressure (lOP) increases (Qureshi, etal.,1999),
and drugs that antagonize serotonin reduce lOP.
Women, onaverage, have higher lOP than men,
andestrogen increases lOP (and serotonin).
Serotonin isamediator ofinflammation that
suppresses metabolism, disturbs blood pressure,
and promotes clotting, 'so itwould bea
Manichean-seeming misfortune ifitwas also
essential tohave lots ofittoexperience
eupohoria. Butinreality astate of"serotonergia"
isastate oftorpor, discomfort; and depression,
rather than astate ofalert pleasure. Itslevels are
above normal inautism, attention deficit disorder,
and some forms ofmental retardation, aswell as
invarious types ofdepression.
Amediator ofstress transduces aninfinite
range ofharmful influences into astereotyped
response, mobilizing the adaptive antistress
systems. Arelatively harmless stress, such as
overheating, chilling, oxygen deficiency or
exertion, can leave theorganism stronger asa
result ofitsadaptation, but other 'kinds of
challenge, such asprolonged darkness, leave the
organism more vulnerable despite itsmobilization
ofitsantistress systems. The difference seems to
bethatpassivity allows ageneralized catabolism,
while an active response strengthens the
functional system thatisbeing challenged. Winter
stress isaprolonged passive stress. The passive
responses ofhibernation, over-eating, lethargy or
depression probably represent thebest biological
response under the circumstances, which have
impaired thecapacity forenergetic response.
Depression, like inflammation, isacostly
reaction foranorganism that can't achieve a
better adaptation. Serotonin isamediator ofboth
depression and inflammation. On the cellular
level, serotonin depresses respiration, andonthe
organismic level itdepresses body temperature
which depresses biochemical reactions generally.
For mood and mental function, it's probably
significant that serotonin depresses blood circula-
tion inthebrain (Mendelow, etal.,1977; Eidel-
man, etal.,1978). There isnoquestion about
serotonin's being amediator ofdepression, except
forthestereotype thatgotitsstart inthe1960s that
wants tosee itasasedative euphoriant, a
deficiency ofwhich produces many psychological
problems. The tryptophan an,cl melatonin indus-
tries were built uparound thisserotonin myth.
Aging and thedegenerative diseases involve
combinations ofmetabolic depression andinflam-
mation. Anti-serotonin agents arecoming tobe
recognized astreatments forawide variety of
degenerative diseases.
Minks that have mated inthewinter don't
implant thefertilized ovum intheuterus until the
spring equinox, when progesterone rises suddenly,
and allows both theuterus ai1d theembryo to
begin the process ofpregnancy and gestation.
Progesterone provides theoxygen needed forthe
successful implantation ofthe embryo, while
estrogen and serotonin lower the intrauterine
oxygen.
Under good conditions, the (premenstrual)
luteal phase ofthe monthly cycle resembles
pregnancy, asaperiod ofprogesterone dominance,
inwhich theabundance ofprogesterone causes
cells todecrease their estrogen content. The luteal
phase isactually thefirst stage ofpregnancy, and
ifthere isimplantation ofanembryo allofthe
processes thatbegin atovulation progress continu-
ously until childbirth occurs. When there isno
implantation, the luteal phase progesterone
dominance isterminated, allowing estrogen to
enter tissues and producing menstruation. The
sudden decrease ofprogesterone production
before menstruation issimilar to decrease of
hormone production just before childbirth. The
same conditions that produce the premenstrual
syndrome, ifthey aren't corrected by the
placenta's massive production ofprogesterone,
will produce preeclampsia, toxemia ofpregnancy,
eclampsia, and postpartum depression. They are
also related tothe problems that become so
common atmenopause. Whenever theproduction
ofprogesterone falls, tissues aresusceptible to
estrogen.
There are several common causes ofa
progesterone deficiency. Deficiencies ofthyroid,
vitamin A,and cholesterol areoften responsible
foraprogesterone deficiency. Inadequate light4
exposure can cause it.Excess polyunsaturated
fats, interfering with gonads and thyroid, can
cause it.And excess serotonin cancause it.
'Serotonin isaprecursor ofmelatonin, which
tends tobeproduced atnight. Because ofthe
books published during theintensive marketing
campaign formelatonin, many people arefamiliar
with thework ofMaestroni and Pierpaoli, who
reported thattreatment with melatonin, orwith the
transplantation ofpineal' glands from young
animals, would extend thelifespan ofmice and
prevent cancer. Melatonin isoften called the
"pineal hormone," though there are other
hormones inthepineal, and many other tissues
canproduce melatonin.
Mice and rats arenocturnal animals, sothey
arenotoriously inappropriate forevaluating the
nocturnal hormones asthey might relate to
humans and other animals that areactive inthe
daytime. Although melatonin sometimes antago-
nizes serotonin inaprotective way, initself itcan
lower body temperature and alertness, suppress-
ing thyroid and progesterone. (Sirotkin, 1997)
Women who aredepressed have been found to
have higher daytime melatonin levels. (Danilenko,
etaI.,1994) While thepopular books have given
theimpression that there isnoquestion about the
protective nature ofmelatonin, itturns outthat in
only five out of36strains ofinbred mice can
melatonin be demonstrated inthe pineal
glands. The famous cancer prone strain, in
which mammary cancer kills practically allthe
females, isone ofthese. When they aregiven
melatonin thedevelopment oftumors isaccel-
erated. When their pineal gland isremoved,
their lifespan isextended.
Estrogen and stress increase free fatty acids,
and unsaturated free fatty acids cause serotonin
release; serotonin, atleast under some circum-
stances, canbelipolytic, increasing thefree circu-
lating fatty acids.
Darkness creates stress, byfree radical inacti-
vation ofthe respiratory enzyme, cytochrome
oxidase, and light restores the activity ofthat
enzyme, and probably also hasa variety ofanti-
free-radical actions. Free fatty acids rise inthe
darkness, intensifying free radical production and
suppressing respiration. Progesterone synthesis is
suppressed bydarkness. The serotonin liberated
bythe fatty acids suppresses progesterone by
inhibiting the secretion ofll:lteinizing honnone
(LH) which stimulates progesterone synthesis, and
also seems toactdirectly ontheovary toÂ·suppress
progesterone secretion (Wilson, etaI., 1975).
While estrogen increases serotonin's actions,
progesterone antagonizes them.
Serotonin depletes glycogen stores, much the
way estrogen and histamine do.This can cause
hyperglycemia. Thyroid, carbon dioxide, and
caffeine, which inhibit serotonin release, alltend
toprotect glycogen stores. Under theinfluence of
carbon dioxide, noradrenaline can still liberate
glucose from glycogen, butserotonin's effect is
inhibited bycarbon dioxide.
Serotonin interferes with slow-wave sleep,
creating asituation resembling thatofdepression
oroldage. Brain glycogen isdepleted inoldage,
andthis depletion contributes toinefficient brain
metabolism. Serotonin's stimulation ofACTH,
which stimulates theadrenal cortex, anditsdirect
stimulation ofcortisone production by the
adrenals, isprobably involved inthe chronic
excess ofcortisone seen indepression andoldage,
which contributes toinsulin resistance anddiabe-
tes,andtotheatrophy ofalltissues including the
brain. (People who arestudying chronic inflam-
matory processes aregathering data that will be
meaningful for understanding depression and
aging, butitseems that psychiatrists don't know
about their work.)
Anti-serotonin drugs such asbromocriptine
have been found tocorrect diabetes, apparently
because serotonin interferes with theuseofsugar,
acting oncells' metabolism todecrease itsuse,
and preventing thesecretion ofinsulin. Bromo-
criptine's correction ofobesity also seems tobe
theresult ofitscorrection ofglucose metabolism.
Inthe1970s, itwas established that darkness
increases theappetite foralcohol. More recently
(Lin andHubbard, 1995) ithasbeen found thatthe
antiserotonin drugs prevent the dark-induced
appetite foralcohol. Alcohol isprobably aself-
medication toalleviate serotonin-related depres-
sion. Alcohol, like progesterone, is
neuroprotective in brain trauma Alcohol increases5
fonnation ofthesedative neurosteroid ("THP")
derived from progesterone (VanDoren, etaI.,
2000), and alcohol increases brain circulation,
countering serotonin's effect.
Progesterone withdrawal and alcohol
withdrawal aresoclosely related that one can
alleviate thesymptoms oftheother.
Isolation might beanother factor contributing
todepression and alcoholism, since itdecreases
thefonnation oftheprotective neurosteroid.
The "brain fog" that isoften described in
depressed people (and people with other serotonin
syndromes, such asthefibromyalgia syndrome) is
probably produced byacombination offactors,
including hypothyroidism, low body temperature,
andhyperserotonemia. The amnesia produced by
shock was found tobeprevented byantiserotonin
drugs (Montanaro, etal., 1979). The same
researchers suggested that the drugs had an
"antipunishment" effect, ineffect making the
animals lessfearful.
There ismore confusion inthemedical litera-
ture regarding theactions ofserotonin than there
isabout practically anyother subject. >
Forexample, there isclear evidence from both
animal and human studies that serotonin, like
estrogen, isassociated with aggression, butthe
dominating stereotype isthat serotonin isthe
agent ofserenity andpeace. Inanepidemiological
study (Moffitt, etal.,1998), a record ofviolence
was clearly associated with above-average blood
serotonin levels. Animal studies show that
darkness stimulates both aggression and eating
(Russell and Singer, 1983), and that serotonin
increases, while antiserotonin drugs decrease,
aggression (Carlini andLindsey, 1983).
When lysergic acid derivatives came onto the
pharmaceutical market, the spirit ofthetimes
caused them tobedescribed asdopamine
agonists, rather than asserotonin antagonists, but
thelatter would beatleast asdescriptive oftheir
effects. Bromocriptine fulfills many ofthe
requirements ofbeing aserotonin antagonist, for
example bysuppressing prolactin. Asaclass, the
serotonin antagonists have avery interesting place
inpharmaceutical medicine, because thebroad
spectrum oftheir therapeutic activity suggests the
great variety ofproblems caused byexcess
serotonin.
The documentation ofextensive government-
supported fraud inresearch LSD and marihu-
anashould make usquestion subsequent research
that plows thesame orsimilar furrows. Myincli-
nation istobelieve that incompetence can't
.account for the glaring errors inresearch on
serotonin-related questions. Commercial commit-
ments toparticular theories ofdrug action have
undoubtedly contributed tothecrazy quality ofthe
psychiatric serotonin literature.
Inthecase ofsome antiserotonin drugs, there
iscommercial support forresearch, sothey might
come into general use inspite ofthe mythic
stature oftryptophan/serotonin/melatonin. But
(Some comments onresearch methods:)
"Serotonin activity" may bejudged bythe
response ofprolactin toserotonin ortoadrug
that isthought tomimic serotonin, orby
serotonin metabolites incerebrospinal fluid, or
bythetotal amount ofserotonin intheblood, or
byitse.fJlux from platelets, ortheratio ofits
concentration inthe plasma and inthe
platelets. Itisn't very clear whether serotonin's
concentration oritsturnover rate ismost
important, and thenumber and sensitivity ofthe
many "serotonin receptors" varies, and
presumably changes themeaning ofany given
quantity ofserotonin. When serotonin's activity
isjudged indirectly, interpretation and subjec-
tivity areinvolved.
Even the "synaptic reuptake inhibitors,"
such asfluoxetine, sometimes relieve symptoms
that arebelieved tobecaused byanexcess of
serotonin (c.Advokat and V.Kutlesic, 1995,
Neurosci Biobehav Rev 1995
Spring;19(l):59-66 Pharmacotherapy ofthe
.eating disorders: acommentary.)
But theactuaL injection ofserotonin, orof
serotonin antagonists that are known to
approximateLy neutralize serotonin's effects,
and theexamination ofthebasaL concentra-
tions ofthehormones known tobereguLated
byserotonin, are much Less likeLy tobe
distorted byarbitrary interpretations.6
When a"receptor" isfirst proposed or
"discovered, "itisalways "aprotein, "though
because oftheidea ofabarrier (semipermeable)
me"mbrane around cells, "membrane lipids" are
sometimes invoked. But after afew years of
research, the "receptor" becomes amore and

The doctrine ofthe "receptor" isintended to

which the subjects have been habituated. One

recorded foreach period and subsequent food and

significantly with theincidence ofmuricide rs=

Serotonin and amino acids: partners indelirium patho-
physiology? vanderMast RC,Fekkes 0"Serotonin isone
oftheneurotransmitters thatmay play animponant role in
medical andsurgical delirium. Normal serotonin synthesis
andrelease inthehuman brain is,among others, dependent
ontheavailability ofitsprecursor tryptophan (Trp) from
blood. The essential amino acid Trp competes with the
other large neutral. amino acids (LNAA) tyrosine,
phenylalanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine fortrans-
port across theblood-brain barrier. This competition deter-
mines itsuptake intothebrain, represented bytheratio of
theplasma level ofTrptothesum oftheother LNAA. The
plasma ratio ofTrp/LNAA, plasma level ofTrp, and
serotonin inplasma andplatelets have been used asindirect
peripheral measures forcentral serotonergic functioning.
Both increased and decreased serotonergic activity have
been associated with deliriUm. Serotonin agonists can
induce .psychosis, both elevated Trp availability and
increased cerebral serotonin have been associated with
hepatic encephalopathy, and excess serotonergic brain
activity has been related tothedevelopment ofthe
serotonin syndrome ofwhich delirium isamain
symptom. Ontheother hand, alcohol withdrawal delirium,
delirium inlevodopa-treated Parkinson patients, andpostop-
erative delirium have been related toreduce cerebral Trp
availability from plasma suggesting diminished serotonergic
function. Rick factors fordelirium such assevere illness,
surgery, andtrauma caninduce immune activation anda
physical stress response comprising increased activity ofthe
lirnbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, the
occurrence ofalowT3syndrome, and, possibly, changes in
thepenneability oftheblood-brain barrier. There areindica-
tions that these changes have their effect onplasma amino
acid concentrations, e.g., Trp, andmultiple cerebral neuro-
transmitters, including serotonin. This stress response may
bedifferent depending onthestage 9fillness being acute or
chronic."

administration elevates 3alpha, 5alpha-THP levels intoe
cerebral cortex topharmacologically relevant concentra-
tions. The elevation of3alpha,5alpha-THP isdose- and
time-dependent. Furthennore, there isasignificant correla-
tion between 3alpha,5alpha-THP levels incerebfaI cortex
andthehypnotic effect ofethanol. Blockade ofdenovo
biosynthesis of5alpha-reduced steroids using the5alpha-
reductase inhibitor finasteride prevents several effects of
ethanol. Pretreatment with finasteride causes nochanges in
baseline bicuculline-induced seizure threshold butreverses
theanticonvulsant effect ofethanol. Finasteride pretreatment
also reverses ethanol inhibition ofspontaneous neural activ-
ityinmedial septal/diagonal band ofBroca neurons while
huving nodirect effect onspontaneous firing rates. Thus,
elevation of3alpha,5alpha- THP levels byacute ethanol
administration represents a novel mechanism ofethanol
action aswell asanimportant modulatory roleforneuroster-
oids intheCNS.

serotonergic drugs onthe aggressiveness induced by
delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol inrem-sleep-deprived rats.
Carlini EA, Lindsey CJ1.delta 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) induced aggressive behavior inrats previously
deprived ofREM sleep. This aggressiveness was signifi-
cantly potentiated bytryptophan and fluoxetine, drugs
which increase brain serotonin availability. 2.Conversely,
drugs which decrease serotonergic function such as
D,L-p-chlorophenylalanine, cinanserin and cyprohep-
tadine strongly blocked theaggressive behavior. 3.On
thebasis ofprevious data indicating aninvolvement of
dopaminergic mechanisms inthistype ofaggressiveness and
the present results showing arole forserotonin, itis
concluded that REM deprivation- THC aggression isunder
thecontrol ofatleast these twoneurotransmitters.

role ofbrain stem serotoninergic neuron system on
thyroid function inrat. Ruzsas C,Jozsa R,Mess B8
Thyroid function was investigated inadult male rats
following the use experimental procedures which
inhibit theactivity ofserotoninergic neuron system.
Pharmacological blockade ofthe biosynthesis of
sertonin by repeated administration of para-
chlorophenylalanine (pCP A), orinterruption (by
Halasz knife) oftheserotoninergic pathways ofthe
brain stem which terminate onhypothalamic nuclei
equally resulted inanaugmentation ofthefollowing
parameters of
activity: TIS ratio, pituitary and blood TSH levels
and blood thyroxine concentration aswell asTRH
content ofthehypothalamus. The results suggest
that the central nervous serotoninergic neuron
system plays aninhibitory role intheregulation of
TSH secretion, pl'csumably acting upon the
hypothalamus, thereby inhibiting hypothalamic TRH
secretion.

Hyperserotonemia and platelet serotonin uptake
and release inschizophrenia and affective disor-
ders. Stahl SM, Woo DJ, Mefford IN,Berger PA,
Ciaranello RD The authors found that platelet
serotonin concentrations were significantly
elevated inpatients with chronic schizophrenia and
inpatients with bipolar major depressive disorder.
High-affinity serotonin uptake was significantly
reduced only inpatients with bipolar major
depressive disorder. Thrombin-induced release of
serotonin from platelets inanypatient group was not
different from thatofnormal control subjects. Platelet
serotonin storage inchronic schizophrenic patients
was also notdifferent from that innormal control
subjects. These platelet findings could not be
explained byage, sex, ormedication variables. The
authors suggest thatthepharmacodynamics ofplatelet
serotonin may bedifferent inchronic schizophrenia
than inbipolar major depressive disorder.

and seasonal variations ofmelatonin and serotonin
in women with seasonal affective disorder.
Danilenko KY, Putilov AA, Russkikh GS, Duffy LK,
Ebbesson SOInwinters 1990-1991 and 1991-1992
women with and without seasonal affective disorder,
winter type, were treated bylight at2500 luxeither in
the morning (0800h-l000h) orafternoon (1600h-
1800h). Inwinter before light treatment, melatonin
levels inserum indaytime (1200h and 1600h) were
higher inpatients compared tocontrols (p<0.05).
This difference disappeared inthesummer orafter
light treatment inthewinter. Also, light treatment and
change inseason resulted inaphase advance shift of
melatonin rhythm inpatients. Thedecline inmelatonin
levels correlated with thedecline inspecific SAD
symptoms ofhyperphagia and carbohydrate craving.
Inwinter, neither patients norcontrols showed signifi-
cant diurnal variations inlevels ofwhole blood
serotonin. Inboth patients and controls, levels of
serotonin were higher insummer ascompared with
winter, especially at2000h. Our data suggest that
elevated daytime melatonin canbeastate marker of
winter depression, andthat seasonal change ofphoto-
period may also affect thecircadian amplitude and
daytime levels ofblood serotonin.

5,7-Dihydroxytryptarnine (10and20microgram) was
micro injected bilaterally into the amygdaloid
COllllllcx ofrats and resulted in55% and 80%
depIction in5-hydroxytryptamine concentration,
respectively. The lesioned animals exhibited fewer
dominance behaviours and submitted more often
toanintruder into their home-cages than didthe
vehidc-injected controls. The lesioned rats were
also more submissive than were thecontrols when
the)' were intruding into another rat's territory. Only
thehigher dose oftoxin altered social investigatory
beh:l\'iour when this was measured inanarena in
which neither rat had established territory. The
lesio!led ratsdisplayed lesssocial interaction andhad
levels ofmotor activity.' The results are

Pineal melatonin content atseveral times during the
day and night was measured in36inbred strains of
mice (Mus musculus) kept under LD 12:12 cycles.
The results have indicated that only five inbred
strains have pineal melatonin content, with higher
levels dudng thenight and lower levels dudng the
day; theother 31strains donotcontain detectable
melatonin intheir pineal gland atany oftimes
examined. The former group includes two commonly
used strains (C3H1He and CBA/Ms) and three wild-
derived strains (Mol-A, Mol-Nis, MOM). C3H and
CBA mice showed asimilar pattern ofpineal
melatonin rhythm with apeak at2hours before lights
on.The peak levels were about 150 pg/gland inboth
strains. The rhythmic patterns ofmelatonin content in
Mol-A, Mol-Nis, and MOM were slightly different
from those inCBA and C3H. In thewild-derived
strains, thepeak ofmelatonin content didnotoccur at
2hours before lights onbut tended tooccur at
midnight. The peak levels were 67-91 pg/gland atthe
highest point inthese strains.10
