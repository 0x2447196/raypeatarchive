Consciousness, nootropics,
andprogesterone
Inthelastfewdecades there hasbeen a
lotofoverlap between the cultures of
“artificial intelligence” and thenootropics
(things that improve mental processes or
protect thebrain) or“smart drugs” (usually
referring tostimulants ofsome sort). These
cultures, totheextent thatthey overlap, are
contributing toaview ofthemind that I
think isharmfUl.
Iwant toconsider progesterone’s effects
onthebrain andconsciousness asacontext
for,andalternative to,those cultural trends.
Ithasbeen known forseveral decades
that progesterone isanessential factor for
nerve growth, andsince the1990s thebrain
hasbeen known tosynthesize it,and to
maintain alocal concentration ofprogester
onewhich ishigher than theconcentration
inthe blood stream. Both animal and
human studies have shown thatproviding
larger than average amounts ofprogesterone
during fetal development results inlargerthan average brains andsuperior abilities in
theoffspring. Women, inproportion to
their height, have onaverage significantly
larger brains than men. Inanimals
generally, alarger brain isassociated not
only with higher intelligence, butwith
greater longevity (Jensen andFuller, 1978,
Mallouk, 1975, Hoffman, 1983).
There hasbeen surprisingly little interest
ininvestigating theways inwhich proges
terone’s presence inthebrain leads to
improved growth, stress resistance, and
functioning, butother lines ofinvestigation
have made itclear that progesterone’s
effects areantagonistic totheeffects ofthe
other major steroid hormones, especially
estrogen, cortisol, and aldosterone. Those
hormones interfere with energy
metabolism, specifically with theoxidation
ofglucose.
The other main experimental treatment
offetuses thathasresulted inthegrowth of
bigger brains istheprovision ofadditional
energy, especially sugar. Itseems likely that
abasic part ofprogesterone’s ability to
protect thebrain against stress isitssupport
forthehigh energy mitochondrial oxidation
ofglucose tocarbon dioxide.
The cortex ofthebrain, especially the
frontal lobes, isthepart most sensitive to
energy adequacy ordeprivation. The
outstanding function ofthefrontal lobes isRay Peat’s Newsletter

temporal orsequential thinking, theordering ofimages andactions through time
(Romine andReynolds, 2004). Theunder
standing oftime iswhere there isthemost
radical difference between mainstream
philosophy ofscience and the anti-
reductionist dissenters.
In1948, there were twoimportant publi
cations, oneofwhich, Claude Shannon’s
“AMathematical Theory ofCommunica
tion,” isseen bymany intheartificial intel
ligence culture astheir charter document.
Defining information interms ofabstract
discrete units, itstated thecomputability
principle ofthelogical atomists inaway
that was useful forprocessing electronic
signals toeliminate noise (byeliminating
thegradations, where random electronic
noise degrades thesignal). The “digital”
units simply hadtobeasignal thatwasvery
much larger than therandom noise ofthe
system, so that its presence, or
non-presence, wasunmistakable.
The other, Norbert Wiener’s
Cybernetics, orControland Comm unica
tionintheAnimal andtheMachine, consid
ered thewaynatural control systems operate
inthemidst ofnoise, bycontinuous interac
tions ofperception and action. Inthis
approach, understanding isananalog of
reality, orcreates amodel ofitthatresem
blesitinform andsubstance asclosely asis2
practical. Continuity istheproperty that
gives the system reliability, since the
system isalways insome meaningful state
that can beevaluated according tothe
intended actions.
“Meaning,” ourintention, hasextension
through time, while noise hasnoextension
through time. The continuous gradations
allow thesignal tobedistinguished from
thenoise.
Consciousness and control involve
understanding, “modeling,” theenviron
ment inaway thatanticipates changes in
theenvironment. Wiener’s 1948 book put
time andbiology atthecenter ofhisthink
ing, andthat same year hepublished an
article focused entirely on“Time, commu
nication, andthenervous system.”
Assoon aselectrical means ofcommu
nication became partoftheculture, they
were used asmodels ofthe nervous
system—sensations were said tobetrans
miffed liketelegraphic messages, thebrain
was like atelephone switchboard.
Shannon’s information theory based on
digital, all-or-none signals, was perfectly
compatible with thetelegraphic models of
nerve impulses andsynaptic transmission.
ARussian approach tothenervous
system typified byP.K.Anokhin haddevel
oped anunderstanding similar toWiener’s;
Anokhin pointed out physiological
processes that were incompatible with the
telegraphic all-or-none model ofnerve
function.
Shannon’s digitized computational and
communication approach toinformation
was formally similar not only tothe
telegraphic theory ofconsciousness, butto
areductionist approach tobeing itself, in
which theunits ofmatter, atoms, have noIthas long been recognized

individual history---if they come toanend
by fission, it’s arandom, uncaused
event. Ifatoms area-temporal, time isonly
astatistical description ofsystems. If
consciousness iscomposed ofdigital
signals, eachofwhich hasonly onekindof
meaning—on oroff—time has only an
abstract meaning fortheconscious system.
Theexperience oftime governs theway
webehave, andourmetabolism governs the
way weexperience time. Progesterone, asa
central neurosteroid, isacrucial partofour
metabolism that shapes ourconsciousness
asitprojects itself intotime (e.g., Koonce
andFrye, 2013).
Ifamodel oftheworld iswritten in
arbitrary symbols, such asthewords ofa
natural language, orthebinary digits ofa
computer code, themessage isthesame,
regardless ofwhat it’swritten on—paper,
semiconductors, orlevers, strings, and
pulleys. Butiftherepresentation ofthe
world isdeveloped intheflowing metabo
lism andphysiology ofanorganism, the
properties ofthemodel will change asthe
condition oftheorganism changes. Norbert
Wiener andP.K. Anokhin both considered
some oftheimplications offine-grain,
continuous, modeling ofreality.
Accurate prediction oftheoutcome of
one’s actions inachanging environment is
amajor purpose ofconsciousness. An
acrobat and adrunk represent different
degrees ofaccuracy intherepresentation of
movement through time. Ifwethink ofour
model oftheworld asthe source of
hypotheses, the acrobat will habitually
produce hypotheses thatareuseful, those of
the staggering drunk arelikely tobe
arbitrary anduseless.IntheWiener worldview, everything has
ahistory which isanintrinsic partofitself,
tobetaken intoaccount asitmoves intothe
future. New situations andpossibilities are
produced when different histories interact,
andthose possibilities willbelimited bythe
extent oftherichness, thecomplexity and
flexibility, ofthephysiology which is
supporting the interactions. Anokhin
observed that nerves seem tovary inthe
complexity ofthesignal that they can
transmit.
Inevery circumstance, adaptive metabo
lism isoccurring inanorganism, andwhen
theenvironment isunfavorable, theorgan
ismcandefend itself bylimiting itsneeds
anditsrange, butwhen theenvironment is
rich, satisfying needs easily, theorganism
willtend toexpand itsrange andabilities.
The “orienting” orexploratory, curiosity
reflex, aneed todiscover andunderstand,
becomes powerful astheother needs are
met. The opportunity toexercise the
exploratory reflex expands notonly the
organism’s functional range, butthatofthe
cells andtissues thatareexercised inexplo
ration and discovery, andtheir energetic
metabolism. Indiscovering something
about theworld, the organism creates
something newinitself.wereIfthe doors ofperception

During stress, idletissues aredismantled
toprovide materials fortheactively adapt
ingtissues, butduring constructive explora
tion, energy isabundant, andcells with the
highest energy needs are protected by
progesterone, testosterone, DI-IEA, and
other steroids. Besides directly stabilizing
theinternal structures ofthecell,progester
one increases theATP concentration and
oxygen consumption, decreases excitatory
systems andnumerous inflammation-related
processes, decreases intracellular calcium
concentration, and increases the useof
glucose, leading toincreased carbon dioxide
production, aswell asadjusting breathing
andpH.
Until about 1990, the ovaries were
believed tobetheonly significant source of
progesterone, anditwas clear that stress
blocked their synthesis ofit,while the
presence ofprogesterone activated the
ovary’s synthetic apparatus inaselfstimu
lating process. (The negative feedback idea
from cybernetics hasbeen widely misap
plied inendocrinology.)
Unlike other needs, the appetite for
exploration isselfstimulating, aslong as
it’ssatisfied, anditisdulled, rather than
intensified, byfrustration. The increased
alertness oftheorienting state intensifies
learning and memory. For example,
researchers watched brain responses by
MRI when various questions orissues were
presented, andnoticed that thehippocam
pus, anarea important forremembering,
was activated when theperson was most
curious about atopic, andthey found that
learning wasimproved when theperson was
inastateofincreased curiosity.
Thefortunate condition ofthebrain with
adequate progesterone isinahigh energystateofreadiness, metabolically supporting
alertness while protecting against excitatory
fatigue. Ithink thisstate isanalogous tothe
high energy resting state ofahealthy
muscle, able torelax immediately after a
contraction, and very resistant tothe
cramping and swelling offatigue. The
reticular activating system ofthebrain
stem, which isresponsible forwaking alert
ness andmuscle relaxation, iscentral tothe
orienting reflex, and isresponsive to
progesterone (Camacho-Arroyo, etal.,
1999). This reticular formation ofthebrain
stem isalsoresponsible fortheREM, rapid
eyemovement, phase ofsleep, inwhich
dreams occur. REM sleep andtheorienting
reflex both promote flexibility andfluidity
ofthinking, with increased sensitivity to
motion, and they both show aunique
electrical activity pattern, the ponto
geniculo-occipital (PGO) wave, which is
probably aproduct ofactivation ofthe
reticular formation. Ithasbeen suggested
(Sanford, etal.,1993) thatthepresence of
these waves inREM sleep “indicates that
thebrain isinastate ofmore-or-less
continual orienting.” When progesterone is
given during sleep, itincreases theamount
ofREM.
Cohn Wilson described the(somewhat
rare) stateofbeing fUlly awake as“dream
inginto theworld.” When theperceptual
system isstrong enough, hebelieved, it
could befully realistic about itssituation,
while grasping thepossibilities existing in
thecomplexity that provide abasis for
optimism.
The “pro-cognitive” effects ofan
enriched environment andofprogesterone
cantosome extent substitute foreach other,
andthey areadditive; both ofthem resist5
themetabolic changes caused bystress.
Both estrogen andthestress-induced gluco
corticoids arereduced byenvironmental
enrichment, allowing progesterone to
function with lessinterference (Meng, etal.,
2015, Welberg, etal.,2006). Environinen
tally enriched animals, progesterone
animals, aremore novelty seeking, andthat
trait isprobably good forhealth andlongev
ity(Cavigelli, etal.,2006).
There has been ageneral medical
antagonism toward the“novelty seeking
trait,” based onthefear that adventurous
people willusually getintrouble, butC.R.
Cloninger isleading atrend intheother
direction, having seen thetrait’s benefits
when it’scombined with abasic sociability.
Sociability, curiosity, appreciating
novelty, being open totheperception of
new possibilities, aretraits that make life
enjoyable, and although they aren’t as
spectacular assome ofprogesterone’s other
effects, they aretraits thatwould bevery
valuable intheworld’s developing social
andeconomic circumstances.
