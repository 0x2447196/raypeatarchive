Autoimmunity
The thymus gland isimportant forgrowth and
fertility, butitisnow considered tobeanimportant
regulator ofthe immune system. Asthe gland
shrinks with aging, theincidence of"autoimmune
diseases" increases, possibly because theregulatory
functions ofthegland have been lost.
Ithas been shown that radiation, polyunsatu-
rated fatty acids, estrogens, and heavy metals and
other toxins including dioxins damage thethymus
gland, and can produce immunodeficiency. These
stressors also stimulate the "autoimmune"
antibodies.
Estrogen shrinks the thymus and blocks NK
cells, andblocks celldivision inthymic cells. Thyroid
stimulates regeneration ofthe thymus, even after
age-related atrophy. Progesterone protects against
thethymic atrophy produced bystress and cortisol,
and promotes thyroid's effects, and protects against
many of the conditions that are called
"autoimmune." Estrogen creates both immunodefi-
ciency andautoimmune degenerative conditions.
Hypothyroidism causes the thymus gland to
atrophy (Abou-Rabia and Kendall, 1994), partly
because thethyroid hormone itself isessential forthe
maintenance ofthegland, and also because hypothy-
roidism islikely tobeaccompanied byexcessive
levels ofestrogen and cortisoL
Polyunsaturated fatty acids interfere with the
formation ofthethyroid hormones, bypreventing the
coupling reaction, which converts iodotyrosine
residues into iodothyronine residues inthe thyro-
globulin. The resulting abnormal thyroglobulin is
antigenic.
Animals that arefed diets that completely lack
thepolyunsaturated fatty acids appear tobefree of
theautoimmune diseases: their tissues can even be
transplanted into other animals with lessantigenicity
than isnormal, sothedietary polyunsaturated fatty
acids seem tobeinvolved inthedevelopment ofthe
abnormally increased antigenicity ofthe various
autoimmune degenerative diseases.Several years ago, Iwrote about Metchnikov's
theory ofimmunity, based onthe role ofthe
phagocyte intheorganism's ordinary growth, and
Ialso argued that inflammation was apathological
reaction, rather than being ahealthy part ofa
defensive immune system. Since then, therole of
inflammation has been recognized inheart and
circulatory disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
other diseases, and even inobesity, diabetes,
depression, andosteoporosis, sothat now itisn't a
universal medical reflex tothink ofinflammation
asapurely normal physiological response.
However, thehistory oftreating inflammation as
part of''the immune system" hasleftaresidue of
medical ideology, inwhich apathogenic organism
must be invoked as the cause of any
inflammation, even though theconcept of"sterile
inflammation" has astrong foundation of
evidence.
Metchnikov's view, that the"immune system"
isaconstructive part ofnormal physiology,
combined with the idea ofinflammation asa
pathological hindrance tonormal functioning and
development, forms theframework foramajor
reconsideration ofthefunctions ofantibodies, the
thymus gland, lymphocytes, and other parts of
"the immune system." Afew people (Jamie
Cunliffe and Polly Matzinger, forexample) are
working onthis new paradigm of"immunity,"
challenging the "assumption that the immune
system ...hasevolved tofind, killand eliminate
foreign organisms." Ifthey areright, then allof
medical thinking about immunity since Metch-
nikov's ideas were discarded has been,
effectively, anattack against afull and proper
understanding ofthenature oftheorganism, and
specifically hasledtoadeep misunderstanding of
growth, regeneration, aging, cancer, and the
functions of nerves, honnones, and tissue
interactions.
Apathogen isusually defined asanorganism
orasubstance that causes tissue damage. Ithink
thedefinition should be"asubstance orprocess
that causes tissue damage," toinclude thepatho-
genic effects ofmalnutrition, stress, andradiation,
forexample. The consequences oftissue damage
have tobedistinguished from thecauses oftissue
damage. The failure todistinguish cause and
effect hasledtomany foolish medical theories.
The new orientation toward the immune
system isthat itsmain function istoclean upthe
debris created bydevelopmental processes (such
astheelimination ofredblood cells, ortheregres-
sion ofthetadpole's tail), orbyinjury, and to
prepare thesystem forrecovery orregeneration.
This orientation brings together ideas from devel-
opmental biology and immunology inavery
encouraging way. For example, arecent study
shows that "autoimmune" antibodies areinvolved
inbrain repair after traumatic injury. (Hofstetter,
etal.,2003.)
The example ofthetadpole's tailprovides a
metaphor that might beuseful inunderstanding
theways inwhich honnones and theimmune
system interact in mammals andpeople. Without
thethyroid honnone, atadpole keeps itstail, and
fails toturn into afrog, though itkeeps growing.
The thyroid honnone causes the animal to
progress toahigher stage ofdevelopment, in
which ithas ahigher metabolic rate and uses
lungs rather than gills. The phagocytic cells
rapidly consume thestructures thatwere appropri-
ate for the lower stage ofdevelopment and
metabolism.
Ithink wecanseeanalogous processes inthe
functioning ofourimmune system. When cells in
any part ofthebody aren't able tomaintain an
efficient energy metabolism, they tend tobe
replaced bynew, more active cells, andthedebris
oftheoldcells is removed byphagocytosis, often
without detectable inflammation. Stimulation and
adaptation arealways causing remodeling ofour
bodies, with bones growing along lines ofstress,
areas ofthebrain expanding with learning, and
organs such astheintestine and liver modifYing2
their metabolism according todiet and exposure
totoxins.
Inflammation, atrophy, ortumefaction can
occur when some part oftheregenerative and
developmental process isdefective. Afailure of
energy metabolism canbeseen ineach ofthese
types ofproblem. Usually, prolonged inflamma-
tion leads toatrophy and fibrosis, which inturn
increases thelikelihood thatatumor willdevelop.
Two organs thatcanchange their mass greatly
inashort period oftime arethethyroid andthe
thymus.
The thyroid can befunctionally suppressed,
and, with stimulation, return tofullactivity within
afewhours. Ifitisstimulated continuously, itcan
increase itsmass greatly inafew days. The
thymus canlosemost ofitsmass inafewhours.
Theremarkable ability ofthethymus gland to
shrink rapidly when it'sexposed toestrogen or
stress orcortisol isvery probably related tothe
fact that "cleaning upmesses" isaprimary
function ofmany ofthecells thatconstitute it.
Most ofthecells ofthe thymus arevery
dependent onsugar metabolism, and this is
disturbed bystress, cortisol, estrogen, and some
kinds offat.Even under nonnal conditions, there
isarapid turnover ofitscells. Many ofthecells
that make upthethymus, like leukocytes gener-
ally, arehighly sensitive toanything that limits
their energy.
These changes inthesize andcomposition" of
thethyroid and thymus glands involve some ofthe
biochemical processes that areinvolved inthe
developmental changes intadpoles andfrogs.
Inflammation occurs when theproduction of
debris istoorapid foritsquiet removal, aswhen
energetic process fail, orwhen certain specialized
organisms interact destructively with thetissues.
The characteristic changes inmetabolism, ashift
toward theproduction oflactic acid andthebreak-
down ofprotein, areprobably asmuch thecause
ofinflammation, asitseffect.
Estrogen isanimportant regulator ofenergy
metabolism, anditistherefore crucially involved
inthediseases known as"autoimmune diseases."
Progesterone, thyroid, and various nutrients
including vitamin E,oppose the actions of
estrogen, andsohave arole intheprevention of
the"autoimmune diseases."
These diseases include rheumatoid arthritis,
multiple sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, Devic's
optic neuritis, cystitis, andvarious types ofhepati-
tisandnephritis andpancreatitis.
Aging andstress areestrogenic, andthisestro-
gen effect leads toatrophy ofthe thymus,
combined with inflammation. The associated
cortisol excess decreases theinflammation, but
aggravates the disregulation ofthe immune
system. Serotonin isanother stress-related factor
that produces involution of the thymus
(Bliznakov, 1980).
The thymus gland permits immune cells to
mature and tobecome organized. Itisamajor
factor intheregulation ofthecells that produce
antibodies, theB(bone marrow derived) lympho-
cytes, and when the thymus ischronically
damaged, theproduction ofantibodies tends to
increase, butwithout thesensitive control the
thymus provides. Thymus-type cells areproduced
notjust inthethymus, butalso inother organs,
especially theliver.
In theyoung organism, thedisruption ofa
tissue exposes avariety ofantigens from the
differentiated cells. Antibodies thatareformed to
these antigens have two very different functions.
They stimulate theremoval ofthedefective cells
anddebris, andthey locally obscure thespecifi-
cally differentiated tissue components, creating a
sortofvacuum tobefilled bythemultiplication of
undifferentiated "stem" cells, which repair the
damaged region.
One lineofresearch indevelopmental biology
emphasizes theinnate tendency ofcells togrow
and multiply, with differentiation and growth
inhibition being thesubsequent result ofinterac-
tions with their environment.
Formany years, researchers such asSzent-
Gyorgyi searched forgeneral orspecific inhibitors
ofcellular multiplication. Szent-Gyorgyi gave the
name "rerin" toamolecule thathethought could
restrain cancer growth. Leonell Strong studied
liver extracts, and found several anticancer agents.
W.S. Bullough extracted materials thatwere tissue
specific, that hethought might synergize with
adrenaline inrestraining tissue growth.3
About 50years ago, anexperiment with
developing frogs' eggs encouraged this line of
research. The experimenter found that when the
juice extracted from aparticular tissue wasadded
tothewater inanaquarium where frog eggs were
starting todevelop, thedeveloping embryo hada
deficiency ofthatparticular tissue, anditsdevel-
opment would stop when the absence or
deficiency ofthattissue became limiting. Inrats,a
similar organ-specific substance had been
suggested byremoving partoftheliver ofonerat
ofapairthatshared thesame blood supply. The
livers ofboth animals grew until thetotal mass
wasappropriate fortwoanimals, buttheoperated
liver stopped growing prematurely, apparently
because acirculating growth inhibiting substance
reached acertain level. Bullough's term "chalone"
hasbeen generally accepted asthename forsuch
growth inhibiting substances.
Isuspect that theimmune system, and the
"autoantibodies," can have afunction comple-
mentary tothatofthechalones, possibly byblock-
ingtherelease ofchalones.
In 1970, I.Hellstrom and K.E. Hellstrom
showed that cancer growth ispromoted byan
antibody, andlater they showed thatantagonists to
that antibody would allow thecancer tobe
suppressed. Their work isstillprogressing, andit
isprobably relevant toboth thechalone theory,
andtotheprocesses ofautoimmunity andtissue
regeneration. Proper control in the immune
system isvery closely associated with the
processes thatmaintain aproper balance between
tissue growth andtissue atrophy. Too much ofan
anti-chalone agent would produce atumor, buttoo
little would lead toatrophy when stress-damaged
tissues weren't replaced.
Recent work byM.Bissell and V.Weaver
shows results parallel totheHellstroms', but
involving theinteractions ofcells, extracellular
matrix, andantibodies.
The healthy thymus gland, which depends on
aproperly functioning thyroid gland, isessential
forclose regulation oftheantibody-producing
cells. With aging and thevarious stressors, the
immune system tends toover-produce antibodies,
asthecell-mediated process become weaker. This
issimilar tothechanges produced byestrogen (for
example, seeAnsar Ahmed, etal.,1989). It's
generally accepted that thethymus isresponsible
for preventing the production ofautoimmune
antibodies. Isuspect that itsactions aremore
subtle, andthatitis(orcanbe)involved indevel-
opmental andregenerative processes.
Animal studies ofautoimmune degenerative
diseases show that estrogen promotes autoimmu-
nity, and that progesterone alleviates orprevents
some ofthetypical autoimmune diseases. Their
antagonistic effects onthemediators ofinflamma-
tion areprobably responsible, aswell astheir
opposite effects ontheactivation ofretroviruses
andstress (or"heat shock") proteins.
Systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid
arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases are
usually corrected bythecombined useofproges-
terone andthyroid, both ofwhich help torestore
thethymus gland.
Although medical people have been taught to
believe that aging isn't anestrogenic state,
contrary tothe clear evidence that estrogen
production (bythearomatase enzyme) inmany
tissues increases with age, anexperiment (Green-
stein, etal.,1992) hasdemonstrated thatgiving an
aromatase inhibitor tooldratscauses their thymus
toregenerate. Now that commercial aromatase-
inhibiting drugs arecoming onto themarket, this
experiment should beofconsiderable interest to
people involved in<fancer treatment, butitsimpli-
cations aresoimportant thatmost researchers and
therapists willprefer toforget it.
The estrogenic state ofoldageorofstress
(with increased exposure tocortisol) ispartly the
result oftheprogressive decrease inthyroid and
progesterone, which isclosely associated with the
decline inrespiratory function andmitochondrial
efficiency.
The declining energy functions increase the
demand for an efficient immune system,
especially when weseetheimmune system asa
regulator oftissue repair andrestoration.
The accumulation ofpolyunsaturated fats
contributes toallphases ofthisprocess ofholistic
decline, from thedecrease ofthecrucial respira-
tory enzyme cytochrome coxidase, through
decreased thyroid hormone activity andprogester-
one activity, totheactivation ofaromatase and4
estrogen andtheproduction oftissue antigens by
toxic products oflipid peroxidation.
Astudy inHawaii found that men who ate
tofu were more likely tohave dementia andbrain
atrophy than men who ateastandard "western"
diet. Soybeans contain estrogenic chemicals, such
asgenistein. InAlzheimer's disease brain metabo-
lism islow. Genistein, likeother estrogens, causes
thethymus gland toatrophy (Yellayi, etal.,2002).
Since Alzheimer's disease isnow often consid-
ered tobean"autoimmune" disease (Grainger and
Reckless, 2003; Kellet, etal., 1982; Lal and
Forster, 1988; Bradford, etal., 1989), both
preventive andcurative approaches should proba-
blyconcentrate onprotecting and restoring the
energy metabolism andthethymus gland.
Besides thesystemic toxic effects ofdietary
polyunsaturated fats, those fats appear tobea
major factor inmaking tissues susceptible to
damage from immunological reactions, since the
tissues ofratsthat aredeficient inthe"essential
fatty acids" arenotdamaged byantibodies that
would seriously injure orkill "normal" tissues.
(Takahashi, etal.,1992; Schreiner, etal.,1988).
These animals arealso resistant tomany toxins,
including endotoxin.
The unsaturation oftissue lipids increases in
aging animals, along with theincreased produc-
tion ofestrogen and decreased production of
pregnenolone, progesterone, and theT3compo-
nent ofthe thyroid hormone. Autoimmunity
increases with aging, asthe thymus gland
atrophies. Aprogram toprevent orcorrect
autoimmunity should also help toreverse thevery
generalized inflammatory and atrophic processes
ofaging. Restoration oftissue lipids (especially
cardiolipin, which activates thecrucial respiratory
enzyme) tothehigh-energy state ofchildhood
would beacentral part ofsuch aprogram. (See
forexample Paradies &Ruggiero, 1991; Paradies,
etal.,1997.)
Antibodies tocardiolipin arepromoted by
excess estrogen (Ahmed &Verthelyi, 1993), and
this isprobably related toestrogen's antirespira-
tory actions.
Rather than viewing autoimmune diseases as
irreversible degenerative conditions, Ithink they
should beviewed asproblems ofmetabolic
energy, processes ofself-repair thatjust need a
little support from improved diet and other
environmental conditions. (See Hofstetter, etaI.,
2003).

ratthymus inexperimentally induced hypothyroidism. Abou-
Rabia N,Kendall MD. The thymus, aspart oftheimmune-
neuroendocrine axis, isgreatly influenced byfactors from most
endocrine glands, especially thethyroid. Antithyroid drugs (carbi-
mazole andmethimazole) were used toinduce hypothyroidism in
rats. Histological and ultrastructura1 examination ofthethymus
showed progressive thymic involution after 4weeks ofdrug treat-
ment totheendofobservations (7weeks). The involution was
characterised byincreased thymocyte apoptosis and thymocyte
phagocytosis bymacrophages. This resulted inthymocyte depopu-
lation, increases innumbers ofinterdigitating cells, alterations to
subcapsular and medullary epithelial cells, anapparent
Increase ofmast cells andcollagen inthecapsule andsepta, and
increased numbers ofBcells and plasma cells. Lymphoid cells
immuno-reactive with MRC OXI2 (which detects Bcells) were
observed within blood vessel walls, suggesting thatthey may have
been moving inandoutofthethymus. Theadministration ofdrugs
causing hypothyroidism, therefore, also caused marked involution
ofthethymus.

importance ofthe thymus extends well beyond tbeinitial
seeding ofthe peripheral T-cell pool. Although peripheral
homeostasis canmaintain T-cell numbers, thethymus isthemajor,
ifnottheexclusive, source ofnew T-cell specificities. With age,
thymus atrophy dramatically reduces theexport ofnew Tcells and
predisposes anindividual toimpaired T-cell function, reduced
T-cell immunity, and increased autoimmunity. Thymus atrophy is
also theprimary obstacle torestoration oftheT-cell pool inthe
aftermath ofHIV treatment orIymphoablative therapies. Here, we
review thymus T-cell production, with particular attention tothe
factors that influence thymocyte export, and examine theimpact
that recent thymic emigrants have ontheperipheral pool. Inthe
future, thymic regeneration might become afeasible and
potentially powerful approach torejuvenating adepleted peripheral

Ovadia 1,Witz IF,Yron IOBJECTIVE: Assessment ofpossible
effects ofovarian stimulation during invitro fertilization (lVF)
treatment cycles oncirculating levels ofantiphospholipid and
antinuclear autoantibodies. DESIGN: The study was performed
prospectively. Sera were obtained atthree time points along IVF
treatment cycle. Levels ofautoantibodies directed against nuclear
components, mitochondrial antigens, and phospholipids were
determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
PATIENTS: Thirty-five patients, who underwent atleast one
previous IVF attempt, and36age- andsex-matched controls were
analyzed. Allparticipants were randomly selected. RESULTS: The
mean levels ofantiphospholipid (but notantinuclear) autoantibod-
iesinsera from IVF-treated patients were found tobesignificantly
higher than thecorresponding values ofthecontrol group (for
immunoglobulin [lg]M isotype: anticardiolipin, antiphosphatidyl
L-serine; for IgG isotype: anticardiolipin, antiphosphatidyl
L-serine, and antiphosphatidylcholine; Pless than 0.0001,
assessed by Mann-Whitney test). The autoantibody levels
remained more orless constant atdifferent time points along the
treatment cycle. Nocorrelation with ageandnumber ofprevious
IVF cycles was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of
antiphospholipid (but not antinuclear) autoantibodies increase
after IVF treatment. Based onthese preliminary data, itisnotyet
possible toestimate iftheobserved changes inautoantibody levels
might have anyfuture clinical influence oninfertile patients under-

Hoffman-Goetz L."This study investigated theeffect ofestradiol exposure
andphysical exercise onlymphocyte proliferation responses toTandBcell
mitogens infemale mice." "In the thymus, there was asignificant
reduction ofproliferation toConA intheOvx+E2animals relative to
theother conditions atboth concentrations ofmitogen. At1.0microglmL
concentration, there was asignificant interaction ofhormone andexercise
treatments. Sham (control) mice given exercise hadahigher proliferation
response relative tosedentary counterparts, whereas E2mice didnotdiffer
inproliferation responses, irrespective ofexercise condition. Inthespleen,
exposure tohigh concentrations ofestradiol was associated with reduced
proliferation responses toboth mitogens; there were, .however, nomain or
interaction effects ofexercise. These results suggest that high levels of
estradiol exposure following ovariectomy inmice significantly reduces
lymphocyte blastogenesis responses, and that thymic immunomodulation
after acute exercise ismasked bythehormonal effect. ..

Fabry Z.Ingeneral, autoimmune responses areconsidered hannful tothe
host. Inthe hest-defined model ofautoimmune disease, murine
experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), for example,
brain-protein-specific autoimmune responses ofboth major classes, type- I
andtype-2, have been implicated incausing brain pathology. Weinduced
type-I andtype-2 autoimmunity tomyelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG)

cerebral injury (ACI) tosee what the consequences ofpre-primed,
autoreactive type-I andtype-2 memory Tcells gaining access tothebrain
inthe course ofsterile tissue injury would be. Neither ofthese
autoimmune response types induced pathology; onthecontrary, both
accelerated re-vascularization and post-traumatic healing. The data
suggest that induction ofeither type-lor type-2 autoimmune responses is
notinherently noxious tothehost, butcanhave beneficial effects ontissue
repair. Autoimmune pathology may develop only ifmolecules ofmicrobial
origin such aspertussis toxin additionally induce the "infectious
nonselfldanger" reaction intheantigen-presenting cells (APC) ofthetarget
organ itself.

"We report here onkinetics ofglucocorticoid-induced murine thymocyte
death invivo bytheTUNEL method. TUNEL-positive cells were observed
asearly asat2hafter intraperitoneal injection ofglucocorticoid." "At6to
8h after the injection, the number ofphagocytosed thymocytes per7
individual macrophage hadreached itsmaximum, andat8to12hmany
ruptured macrophages ingesting too many dying thymocytes became
noticeable. During theprocess, noadditional macrophages appeared tobe
mobilized tothethymus. At6to8h after theinjection, however,
coincidentally with thefact that macrophages had become unable to
further ingest dying lymphOCytes, dead cells were leftunphagocytosed, and
ultimately became "free" positive cells, probably duetosome proteolytic
process ongoing within thethymus. Aslate asat12h,morphological
examination revealed that epithelial cells seemed tobegin engulfing
thymocytes, almost simultaneously with the start ofrupture ofthe
macrophages duetotheingestion oftoomany thymocytes." "Altogether,
these results suggest that: I)even though thymocytes were exposed to
glucocorticoid invivo, most ofthem were notTUNEL-positive unless they
were phagocytosed; 2)even after most macrophages had ingested too
many cells atlater stages, macrophages inother locations didnotmigrate
tothethymus; and finally, 3)deletion ofdamaged thymocytes was also
carried outbythymic epithelial cells, though notfrequently, ataround 12h
andlater."
Rinsho Shinkeigaku 1993 Sep;33(9):995-7. [Acase ofHashimoto's
encephalopathy with arelapsing course related tomenstrual cycle)
Ishii K,Hayashi A,Tamaoka A,Mizusawa H,Shoji S.Acase of
43-year-old woman with Hashimoto's encephalopathy who experienced
three relapses closely associated with themenstrual cycle isreported. In
April 1992, shebegan toexperience occasional tremors inherarms. Three
months later, sheexperienced ageneralized seizure andwastransferred to
ourhospital. Hashimoto's thyroiditis was diagnosed onthebasis ofhigh
thyroid microsomal titer andmild hypothyroidism. Neurological findings
inadmission included action tremor inboth hands, myoclonus inall
extremities, cerebellar ataxia, confusion, andhyperreflexia Cerebrospinal
fluid showed elevated protein level without pleocytosis.
Electroencephalogram showed diffuse slowing and magnetic resonance
imaging ofbrain wasnormal. Hashimoto's encephalopathy was diagnosed
from these findings. These episodes ofremission and exacerbation were
observed during theadmission. Her symptoms started atovulation,
worsened during theluteal phase, and improved when menstruation
started. After thethird relapse, shewas treated with oral thyroxine
for hypothyroidism and with an estrogen and progesteroue
combination toregulate the menstrual cycle. Her thyroid function
gradually became euthyroid and she did not experience any
subsequent relapses. The relation between therelapsing course and
menstrual cycle suggests that theperiodic alteration ofgonadotrophic
and/or gonadal hormones orthemenstrual regulating center itself in
thebrain may beanimportant factor ofpathogenetic mechanism of
thedisorder.

cological levels ofsteroidal and nonsteroidal estrogens including alpha-
dienestrol, 17beta-estradiol, and diethylstilbestrol demonstrate bone

hemopoietic stem cells. Hormones with little estrogenic activity including
testosterone and progesterone failed toinduce myelotoxicity asdid
nonestrogenic metabolites ofDES." "One ofthese mechanisms ismediated
through thethymus since surgical thymectomy abolished theability of
estrogens tosuppress CFU proliferation." "That theinitial events in

mechanism was suggested bytheability ofantiestrogens toinduce antago-
nism when administered prior toestradiol and thepresence ofestrogen
binding components inIymphoreticular tissues including thethymus and

following estrogen exposure is,inpart, due toalterations inregulatory
factors produced bythymic epithelial cells inresponse toaspecific estro-

ofcastrated BIW mice with androgen orestrogen wasable tomodulate this
clearance. Young (3-month-old) male and female 81W mice cleared
IgG-sensitized mouse erythrocytes rapidly, whereas older males (13
months) and females (7months) showed amarked impairment intheir
ability toclear these cells. Inaddition, erythrocytes sensitized witb
complement intheabsence ofantibody were cleared within 5min in
young BIW mice. Older mice showed agreater and more rapid clear-
ance rate ofthese cells. Castrated female BfWmice treated with androgen
implants from three weeks ofage showed improved clearance of
IgG-sensitized erythrocytes at7months, whereas estrogen-treated male
mice showed delayed clearance. These results suggest an
age-dependent defect intheclearance ofIgG-sensitized particles, perhaps
due todiminished levels ofserum complement and/or saturation ofFc

progesterone (P) deficiency infemale patients with thyroid and
ovarian autoimmune disease." "Inthiscontext, thehormonal profile in9
women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in9age-matched ealthy
women, were evaluated toverify the presence ofasteroid hormone
secretion impairment inasystemic autoimmune disease, further supporting
ourhypothesis ofPdeficiency involvement. Pandandrogen plasma levels,
inthe luteal phase, were signi:(icantly lower (p<0.05 and 0.005,
respectively) inRA patients than inthecontrol group ....""Moreover,
despite normal cortisol values, corticosterone (B) plasma levels were
significantly higher intheRApatients (p<0.01 and0.05 infollicular and
luteal phase, respectively). Therefore, our present data confirm the
androgen deficiency inpatients with asystemic autoimmune disease, such
asRAand support theimmunomodulator effect ofP.""Inconclusion, in
addition toandrogens, theimmunomodulator roleofPshould also betaken
intoaccount inthepathogenesis ofthesystemic autoimmune disease."

immunomodulators inhealth and disease. Verthelyi D."Studies in
normal mice show that estrogen treatment induces polyclonal Bcell
activation with increased expression ofautoantibodies characteristic
ofautoimmune diseases. Several mechanisms appear tocontribute tothe
break intolerance and theincrease inplasma cell activity including a
reduction ofthemass ofthebone marrow andthethymus, theemergence
ofsites ofextramedullary hematopoiesis and altered susceptibility ofB
cells tocell death. Inaddition, sexhormone levels inboth humans and
experimental models correlated with theactivity oftheir cytokine-secreting
cells indicating that sex hormones influence the cytokine milieu and
suggesting that altered sex hormonal levels inautoimmune patients
contribute totheskewed cytokine milieu characteristic ofsystemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE)."

number ofplasma cells and enhances their autoantibody prodnction in
nonautoimmune CS7BLl6 mice." Verthelyi DJ,Ahmed SA"Inthisstudy,
byemploying ELispot, image cytometry, flow cytometry, cytology, and
ELISA., weshow that long-term exposure ofnormal mice toestrogen10
activates Bcells toproduce higher numbers ofnotonly immunoglobulin-
producing cells, but also autoantibody-producing cells. Estrogen
promoted adecrease inB220(+) splenic lymphocytes, butresulted ina
to-fold increase inplasma cells. Further, theoutput ofimmunoglobulins
including autoantibodies from individual plasma cells from estrogen-
exposed mice was markedly increased, suggesting Bcell hyperactivity.
Importantly, ourfindings show that treatment ofnormal mice, solely with
estrogen, canoverride Bcelltolerance andpromote autoreactive Bcells in
normal individuals."

B-cell repertoire inoldmice. Weksler ME, Russo C,Siskind GW. "These
studies have shown that the alterations inthe repertoire ofantibody
produced byoldmice isnotduetoanintrinsic defect inthebone marrow
orintheB-lymphocyte population arising from thebone marrow butrather
toaselective downregulation byauto-anti-idiotypic antibody andidiotype-
anti-idiotype interactions, shifting theidiotype distribution intheperiph-
eralB-cell population." "The overall shift may bedescribed asadecreased
reactivity toforeign antigens and acomplementary increase inreactivity
with selfantigens."

pbytoestrogen genistein induces thymic and immune changes: a
human health concern? Yellayi S,Naaz A.,Szewczykowski MA., Sato T,
Woods JA,Chang J,Segre M,Allred CD, Helferich WG, Cooke PS."Use
ofsoy-based infant formulas and soy/isoflavone supplements hasaroused
concern because ofpotential estrogenic effects ofthesoy isoflavones
genistein and daidzein. Here weshow that s.c. genistein injections in
ovariectomized adult mice produced dose-responsive decreases in
tbymic weight ofupto80%. Genistein's thymic effects occurred through
both estrogen receptor (ER) and non-ER-mediated mechanisms, asthe
genistein effects onthymus were only partially hlocked bythe ER
antagonist ICI182,780. Genistein decreased thymocyte numbers upto
86% and doubled apoptosis, indicating that the mechanism ofthe
genistein effect onloss ofthymocytes iscaused inpart byincreased
apoptosis." "Critically, dietary genistein atconcentrations that
produced serum genistein levels substantially less than those in
soy-fed infants produced marked thymic atrophy. These results raise
thepossibility thatserum genistein concentrations found insoy-fed infants
may hecapable ofproducing thymic and immune abnormalities, as
suggested byprevious reports ofimmune impairments insoy-fed human
infants."

supraphysiological levels ofestrogen invivo induce damage inlymphoid
cells; however, theimpact ofestrogen associated lymphoid tissue damage
onspecific immune functions remains tobedetermined."
