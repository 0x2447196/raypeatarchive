"Cocaine babies," criminal
responsibility, andmedicine
Many pregnant women have been prosecuted
for"delivering anillegal drug totheir fetus" when
they usecocaine.
Ifaperson chooses tobelieve something that's
contrary tothebest evidence, when they areaware
oftheevidence, thatcanbecalled faith. Butwhen
their behavior harms others, their willful
ignorance becomes amoral issue.
When the medical profession starts toget
something right, acentury after researchers had
clarified thefacts, thegeneral euphoria should be
tempered bywhat isactually happening. The
medical profession isnow concerned about the
harmful effects ofusing cocaine and alcohol in
pregnancy. Exactly what does thisnew seemingly
realistic attitude mean? What could motivate this
great new interest inthewell-being ofthefetus?Why are these substances the focus ofsuch
concern? I'mafraid itispurely because these are
allself-administered substances, and theblame
can beplaced ontheuser, rather than Â·onany
powerful institutions.
Just 30years ago, theconventional wisdom
was that thefetus isisolated and insulated from
"The legal responses tothe "crack baby
scare" clearly didmuch more harm than good to
both the mothers and the children. Making
substance abuse during pregnancy acrime kept
mothers from prenatal medical care, thereby
endangering thefetus farmore than would bethe
case with drug use, and discouraged them from
seeking drug treatment. "
"...thefact remains that recent studies on
cocaine use bypregnant women clearly demon-
strate that thepharmacological impact ofcocaine
has been greatly exaggerated, that many other
factors impact onfetal and newborn development,
and that legal responses tomaternal cocaine use
have made every aspect oftheproblem worse. "

themother's metabolism. Tnethalidomide episode
was already forcing doctors toacknowledge that
some drugs might get through the placenta,
though thedrug industry was reluctant tolose the
pregnant-woman market.
The idea that fetal qamage could result from
the mother's malnutrition was rejected asan
impossibility. The food industry didn't want to
have totesttheir GRAS (generally recognized as
safe) additives forfetal safety, anditdidn't want
women togettheidea thatthey should avoid junk
foods, such aspasta andbread, during pregnancy.
People attheHarvard School ofPublic Health
said thatitwas nonsense tothink thatfoods could
benutrient-deficient--"if thesoil doesn't have the
chemicals plants need, the plants won't grow;
therefore, allcrops are fully nutritious." The
chemical composition ofplants was supposedly
determined strictly bytheir genes, sothe soil
couldn't determine their nutrient content. The
fetus, likeaplant, was supposed tobegenetically
determined, butunlike aplant, itwas said tolive
likeaparasite onthemother, taking everything it
needs from themother's tissues, rather than from
themother's dietetic intake. Ifthemother was
alive, her nutritional condition couldn't have
anything todowith thefetus.
Probably inreaction against the biological
evidence that maternal malnutrition produced
defective offspring, theAmerican. medical estab-
lishment adopted theconcept that "fetal malnutri-
tion" existed, andwas caused byadefective uterus
orplacenta, not byanything themother might
have eaten orfailed toeat.InItaly andGermany in
the1970s, aslightly saner concept was emerging,
inwhich it was proposed that amalnourished
fetus could befedbyinfusing amino acids intothe
amniotic fluid, orthat themother andfetus might
benefit from intravenous glucose andamino acids.
Theuseofprogestins tostimulate placental devel-
opment was also suggested inEurope. (Farad and '
Picas, 1976.)
Poor, illiterate, drug using women arenow
being charged with "giving cocaine totheir fetus"
when they usethedrug. What this means isthat
there areelements inourjudicial system which are
saying thatilliterates andderelicts must beheld to
ahigher standard than doctors ofmedicine were
when these women were children--and toahigher
standard than that ofthepresent state licensing
boards which have nothing tosaytophysicians
who prescribe reducing diets and diuretics and
teratogenic drugs, and even x-rays, topregnant
women.
Several articles on cocaine babies have
emphasized the huge cost resulting from their
health care. Ihave never seen adiscussion ofthe
economics ofthedamage caused bymedical and
governmental aggressions against thepublic. Ifthe
cost tothepublic ofcaring forcocaine babies is
theimportant issue, then weshould consider the
cost ofpreventing thedamage inthemost direct2
way, but that requires knowing what the real
causes ofthedamage are.
The evidence that these babies' defects are
caused bycocaine isfairly odd. Being scientifi-
cally careful about evaluating theevidence in
this situation isimportant, considering the
history and thecontext.
Inthelate 1960s, most ofthepublications on
thedangers ofLSD andmarihuana were fraudu-
lent. While typical LSD users took about 100
micrograms ofthedrug, experiments using doses
that were the human equivalent oftens of
thousands ofmicrograms were used toargue for
thedrug's dangers. Those doses would have killed
people, inashort time.
Inhumans, aslittle as20milligrams of
cocaine injected intravenously issaid tohave been
fatal, andtheaverage lethal oral dose is500milli-
grams. Injected cocaine ismuch more powerful
than oral doses. Inanimal studies, doses equiva-
lent tothousands ofmilligrams per day in
humans areinjected into rats before harmful
effects are seen inthefetuses. Drugs injected
intravenously orinjected into theperitoneal cavity
arevery rapidly andcompletely absorbed, andthe
only doses that caused measurable fetal harm in
rats were doses that, onaweight basis, almost
certainly would have caused nearly instantaneous
death inhumans.
Cocaine suppresses appetite. When pregnant
animals arefedthesame limited amount offood
consumed bycocaine-treated animals, their under-
nourished offspring show most ofthesame effects
seen inthelitters thatwere exposed tococaine.
The human placenta passes asmaller percent-
ageofcocaine tothefetus than theratplacenta
does, and theliver ofthehuman fetus ismore
effective atdetoxifying cocaine, soanyeffects of
cocaine onratfetuses areprobably going tobe
larger than anyeffect onthehuman fetus.
Behavioral disturbances intheoffspring are
considered tobeavery sensitive indicator ofa
chemical's teratogenicity, but some researchers
have concluded that cocaine might not bea
behavioral teratogen. (Riley and LaFiette, 1996)
Others have described itas"not apotent
neuroteratogen." (Chen, etal.,1996)
The effects ofcocaine thataresupposedly seen
inhumans seem nottobeproduced bycocaine in
lab animals. Intrauterine growth retardation,
microencephaly, abruptio placentae, spontaneous
abortion, sudden infant death syndrome, and
mental retardation arecommonly said tobethe
consequences ofprenatal exposure tococaine.
Many things cancontribute tothose problems, but
malnutrition isthemost common cause, andisthe
onethat American medicine goes togreat lengths
toavoid mentioning. Prenatal x-rays, diuretics,
and pregnancy weight-control diets are other
important causes.
How isitthat cocaine and starvation can
produce thesame symptoms? Ithink theevidence
indicates that cocaine isn't the cause ofthe
pregnancy problems that areblamed onit.But,
since cocaine suppresses theappetite, itdoes have
some role intheproblems ofgestation caused by
malnutrition.
Most crack smokers arepoor, very few eat
well, and nearly allofthem smoke. Smoking
causes damage tothefetus that ismuch easier to
demonstrate than thetheoretical damage caused
bycocaine. The media arefilled with thecocaine-
ba1:?y issue. "Have youever seen acocaine baby?"
Butdowehear them asking "Have you ever seen
ababy born toasmoker?" Or,"have you seen the
babies ofmalnourished women?"
To pretend that any effects produced in
pregnant rats, byadose ofcocaine which ismany
times larger onaweight basis than thesupposedly
lethal human dose, arerelevant topublic health, is
crude propaganda, and presumably has the
purpose ofsupporting political, judicial ormilitary
actions that are completely unrelated topublic
health ormorality.
Putting themedico-legal propaganda initsbest
light, itisscientifically atrocious. But theactual
moral issue isthat itisnotused foranyconstruc-
tive purpose. One nutritious high protein meal
every daywould probably solve the"cocaine baby
problem," butitappears that neither thegovern-
ment northemedical establishment isinterested in
solving theproblem.
Novocaine (procaine) was introduced asa
substitute forcocaine, butithas been found to
have protective effects onthe organism, asan3
adaptogen. Lidocaine and other local anesthetics
have many important protective effects. Inthis
context, some experiments that hint atafetus-
protecting effect ofcocaine deserve further
investigation.
Cocaine was displaced from medical use, first
bytheproprietary synthetic local anesthetics, and
then, in the 1930s, by the proprietary
amphetamines.
As astimulant, cocaine increases the
metabolic rate, which intum can lead tothe
wastage ofprotein, toprovide energy. Conven-
tional first aidforacocaine overdose includes
providing glucose and thiamine, toprovide
energy. The same nutritional support, butprefera-
blywith additional protein, isobviously appropri-
ateforprotection ofthefetus. The presence of
increased amounts ofammonia inthe urine
indicates malnutrition in both adults and
newborns, and might beauseful indicator for
nutritionally stressed pregnancies. Supplementing
both dietary protein andcarbohydrate might bethe
simplest treatment formany types ofgestational
stress, including preeclampsia and "recreational"
cocaine use.
The Andean people who use coca regularly
appear tosuffer noharmful effects. Coca chewing
prevents thehypoglycemia that can beproduced
byextremely high altitude. Itiscommon tokeep a
wad oftheleaf inthemouth allday. The dental
health ofcoca-chewers issogood that aBolivian
company has marketed atoothpaste containing
coca leaf. (But itisprobably thehigh altitude
itself that ismainly responsible fortheir good
teeth.) The coca leafhasbeen used medicinally in
South America forimproved fertility, prolonga-
tion ofvirility into oldage, prevention ofaltitude
sickness, andvarious other purposes. The associa-
tionofcoca chewing inthese cultures with magic
and gods with erect phalluses (El TiD, Supay)
probably affected theherb's treatment bytheanti-
erotic cultures.
Atvery high altitude, fertility islimited bythe
availability ofoxygen. Altitude itself tends to
increase the'ratio ofprogesterone toestrogen, asa
protective adaptation involving increased carbon
dioxide inthe tissues. Cocaine increases the
production ofthe pituitary gonadotrophin, LH
(luteinizing hormone), which increases ovarian
progesterone production. Inmen, LHincreases
testosterone production. Chewing coca leaves has
been found tosharply increase theamount of
progesterone insaliva. Increased progesterone
would increase theability tomaintain pregnancy
under stressful conditions.
Used moderately, forhealth purposes, there
would seem tobenoproblem with cocaine, and
there seems tobeaphysiological rationale even
foritsuseduring pregnancy under some condi-
tions. Theuseofprogesterone, thyroid, andnutri-
tion would obviously bebetter ways toprotect
fetal development.
Smoking during pregnancy isamuch bigger
public health issue than cocaine use.Ranking with
smoking, interms ofdamage done todeveloping
babies, are prescribed diuretics, inappropriate
drugs forepilepsy during pregnancy, weight-
control diets forpregnant women, x-rays ofthe
developing fetus, and--probably the biggest
problem ofall--poverty andmalnutrition.

inAddis Ababa, Ethiopia in1974-1975 with a
frequency of5.5/1 000 births. This disorder had its
peak frequency atterm. Noabnormalities were found
intheplacentas toexplain theplacental abruptions but
there were other clues totheir genesis. There was a
strong association ofthe fatal abruptions with
severe poverty inthemothers. These poor mothers
were both undernourished and malnourished
during pregnancy. Their fetuses and neonates who
died hadmultiple evidences ofundernutrition includ-
ingarelative undergrowth ofadrenals, spleens and5
livers andarelative acceleration oflung maturation.
These findings support observations inmore prosper-
ous nations that poor nutrition ofthegravida may
have animportant role inthegenesis ofabruptio
placentae.
