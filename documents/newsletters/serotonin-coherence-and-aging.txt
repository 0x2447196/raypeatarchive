Serotonin, coherence
and aging
45 years ago the “best” medical schools were
still teaching that inflammation indicated the
presence of an infection, and that it was the body’sdefensive reaction, an integral part of its immunity.Now, inflammation is seen to be intrinsic to thedisease process itself, in an increasing number ofthe chronic and degenerative diseases—dementia,psychosis, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, cancer,for example. One interpretation of the “autoim-mune” diseases is that there is a specific occultinfection, another interpretation puts the blame ona defective immune system which is attacking“self.” An alternative view (Claudia Miller andNicholas Ashford, 2012, for example) is thatmultiple chemical exposure has contributed to theproblem of inflammatory sicknesses.
The change of official medical opinion on that
issue is timely, since the prevalence of inflamma-tory disease is increasing very rapidly, amongyounger and younger people. Inflammatory boweldisease, kidney disease, certain cancers, SLElupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis,pulmonary arterial hypertension, and depressionare conspicuous among these—pulmonary hyper-tension has been described as “an emergingepidemic” (Wijeratne, et al., 2018), and “majordepressive disorder, a common and recurrentdisorder, has been projected to become the secondleading cause of disability worldwide by 2020”(Strekalova, et al., 2015).  All of these diseases aremore prevalent among women than men, and insome of them the difference is increasing along
with the prevalence. 
This changing pattern of disease is an opportu-
nity to learn more about our nature, and about thefactors involved in this association of femalenessand inflammatory-degenerative changes in thetissues. Changes in drug use seem to be responsi-ble for some of these changes, and the pharmaceu-tical industry is already taking defensivemeasures.
The structural molecules of a cell,
its metabolites and water aremutually dissolved, and their affinityfor each other is affected by thecell’s energetic relation to itsenvironment. This mutual affinity isregulated by the balance ofhormones and nutrients.
When pellagra, the niacin deficiency disease,
was common, it was known that women wereaffected by it more seriously and much more oftenthan men. The disease involved psychiatricproblems, diarrhea, and skin photosensitivity, andI think it can give us an insight into the presentpreponderance of chronic disease in women.
Serotonin, tryptophan and melatonin all share
a chemical structure known as an indole group.The indole structure is widely used by plants,animals and the simplest organisms in some of themost basic functions of life, including photosyn-thesis, movement, perception, structural mainte-nance, and regulation of water.

formation of the most highly interactive systems.
Dietary tryptophan is incorporated into all of
our proteins except collagen, and it is alsoconverted into a variety of small molecules,including niacinamide and serotonin. Estrogenstrongly affects the metabolism of tryptophan,increasing its conversion to serotonin at theexpense of niacinamide, which accounts for thesymptoms of pellagra when the diet lacks trypto-phan. When there’s enough protein in the diet,promotion of serotonin synthesis won’t result in aniacinamide deficiency, but conditions thatincrease the influence of estrogen will alsoincrease the malfunctions involving serotonin.
When there’s enough protein in
the diet, promotion of serotoninsynthesis won’t result in a niacina-mide deficiency, but conditions thatincrease the influence of estrogenwill also increase the malfunctionsinvolving serotonin.
Estrogen increases the formation of serotonin,
and both of these substances increase the forma-tion of prolactin, and activate the renin-angiotensinsystem, and increase secretion of the antidiuretichormone vasopressin, all of which synergize withestrogen in promoting water retention. Serotoninincreases the formation of estrogen, so a viciouscircle can easily develop when the organism isunder stress.
The retention of water by the living substance
is a topic that reductionist biology has been reluc-tant to discuss. There are no pumps for biologicalwater, and it took a long time for a “waterchannel” protein to be proposed. The structuralmolecules of a cell, its metabolites and water aremutually dissolved, and their affinity for eachother is affected by the cell’s energetic relation toits environment. This mutual affinity is regulatedby the balance of hormone s and nutrients. ATP is a
crucial factor in regulating the optimal state ofwater retention.
The outer region of cells near their surface is
generally occupied by a layer of filamentousproteins, and this zone of the cell provides resis-
tance and maintains the form of the cell. Everyhealthy cell has this distinct contrast betweeninside and outside, but this doesn’t normallyinvolve a mechanical stiffness, but the actincytoskeleton becomes stiffer when the cell isunder too much stress and unable to maintain itshighest energy state. In this low energy distressedstate, the barrier function begins to be lost.
Serotonin can activate the polymerization and
stiffening of actin filaments, and increased polym-erization can cause problems in breathing andblood circulation as well as increasing the leaki-ness of vascular walls (An, et al., 2002; Lai, et al.,2005; Shi, et al., 2016; Bloodworth, et al., 2018).Serotonin causes dissolved monomers of actin topolymerize, which can disrupt existing barriers aswell as reducing the flexibility of cells (Gressner,et al., 2009). 
When metabolic energy is failing, as in
hypothyroidism, muscles become easily fatigued,and take up excess water, and the barrier structureis loosened, allowing macromolecules and ATPand other metabolites to leak out, while extrane-ous substances enter. Typical muscle enzymessuch as lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinaseappear in the bloodstream in typical hypothyroidmyopathy, and heart proteins, including a particu-lar form of lactic dehydrogenase and a muscleprotein, troponin, appear in the blood after a heartstress or fatigue combined with hypothyroidism orsystemic inflammation. In the case of the liver, itsspecific enzymes appear in the blood when thecells’ barrier function is weakened by stress. The“immune system” regularly deals with substancesthat are released by stressed cells. 
Hyperventilation tends to increase under
various stresses, and the resulting loss of carbondioxide increases the alkalinity of the blood,which causes the platelets to release serotonin.Estrogenic stimulation and hypothyroidism arecommon causes of chronic hyperventilation, withits effect on platelets, releasing serotonin, with allits harmful consequences. A great source of errorin serotonin research is to think of the binding ofserotonin to its “transporter” protein as somethingintrinsic and genetically determined, when it isactually susceptible to momentary changes inenergy and pH. When serotonin is tightly held by2the platelets, there is very little of it free in the
plasma, and so it has little effect on the rest of theorganism. However, if something suddenlyreduces the amount of CO2 in the blood, theamount of serotonin in the plasma can increasegreatly, making the blood vessels more permeable,and potentially interfering with the functioning ofthe organs, with leaked proteins creating edema,decreasing oxygen delivery, causing inflammation. Administering oxygen to sick people, or mechani-cally hyperventilating them, displaces CO2 and bycausing the platelets to release serotonin canincrease their sickness and likelihood of dying.This is a common practice, despite the evidence ofincreased mortality with even moderatehyperoxia (Rodríguez-González, et al., 2014; Page,et al., 2018; Kim, et al, 2018).
Any disruption of normal cell or tissue struc-
ture is recognized by the organism as a problem tobe corrected; the appearance of ATP outside cellsis a basic sign of damage and danger. Specialenzymes degrade extracellular ATP into ADP,AMP, adenosine, and other purines, and thesecontribute to the alarm-stress signals. Increasedsynthesis of serotonin is one of the most importantresponses to leaked ATP and adenosine, butserotonin can increase the disorder of the actinsystem, increasing leakiness, in a vicious circle;both serotonin and ATP increase estrogen secre-tion (Rossato, et al., 2001; Klempan, et al., 2011).Extracellular ATP reaches a high level in tumorsand becomes part of a self-stimulating growthpromoting system. Fragments of actin in the blood-stream are a common consequence of stress-induced leakiness that must be controlled topreserve health; it happens that the vitamin Dbinding protein is a scavenger for this potentialcause of “autoimmune disease,” and this mightrelate to the fact that these diseases generallyinvolve vitamin D deficiency. 
The SSRI antidepressants are frequently used
to treat people with traumatic brain injury, but ithas been found that the synthesis of serotonin inthe brain is increased by trauma and contributes tothe injury (Pappius, et al., 1988), and that decreas-ing serotonin by a variety of means (Sharma, et al.,2000; 2019) improves recovery from braininjuries.  The Blood Brain Barrier, BBB, has sometimes
been treated as something unique, but it’s just aspecial case of the cellular resistance that existseverywhere. For example, after intense exercisethat produces fatigue and damage to muscles, aunique brain protein, S100B, that is considered acrucial part of the BBB, can be found in the bloodstream. The exchange of substances, even proteinsand nucleic acids, between cells and their environ-ment, increases during stress. The detection ofsubstances such as S100B in the blood is nowrecognized as evidence of depression and braindamage (Arora, et al., 2019; Park, et al., 2019). Ithas been known for a long time that serotonin isable to increase the permeability of blood vessels,including the BBB, but there hasn’t been muchpublicity of the fact that SSRIs can increase theleaking of S100B into the blood (Akhisaroglu, etal., 2003; Dai, et al., 2018; Pawluski, et al.,2019). 
Every healthy cell has this
distinct contrast between inside andoutside, but this doesn’t normallyinvolve a mechanical stiffness, butthe actin cytoskeleton becomesstiffer when the cell is under toomuch stress and unable to maintainits highest energy state. In this lowenergy distressed state, the barrierfunction begins to be lost.
The great majority of the body’s serotonin is
produced in the intestine, where the tissue isconstantly exposed to foreign material such asendotoxin, but all cells in the body can produceserotonin and histamine during stress, and theblood platelets are one of the body’s defensesagainst serotonin; they can sequester it and carry itto the lungs for destruction. The lungs have agreat capacity to oxidize it.  
Severe stresses in one part of the body spread
their influence through the body, in the processnow called the bystander or “off-target” effect.Serotonin, nitric oxide, and ATP are among thesubstances that are known to spread damage3signals through the body, for example from ioniz-
ing radiation, localized infection, or surgery.
The capillaries in the brain resemble those of
the lung in their ability to take up and destroyserotonin; they treat it as a toxin to eliminate.(Hardebo and Owman, 1980 a,b; Hardebo, et al.,1979.) If something (such as estrogen excess)reduces the cells’ ability to oxidize and inactivatethe serotonin, its action on the actin cytoskeletonwill allow harmful amounts of serotonin and othermaterials to enter the brain.
. . . appearance of ATP outside
cells is a basic sign of damage anddanger
The large controlled studies of SSRI antide-
pressants found a significant, but very small differ-ence in effect between the drugs and a placebo.Their antidepressant effects have often been foundto depend on effects other than the availability ofserotonin in the brain. For example, a large propor-tion of depressed people are constipated, andSSRIs have a prokinetic, accelerating effect in theintestine, functioning as a laxative (Gorard, et al.,1994). Relieving constipati on has a powerful effect
on mood and sense of well-being. For example,naloxone or naltrexone, by correcting an excessiveendorphin balance, has a laxative action, whichundoubtedly contributes to its significant anti-depressive effect. Large doses of vitamin C,functioning as a cathartic, have many therapeuticeffects, and it is gaining recognition as anantidepressant.
Because it hasn’t been possible to provide
evidence to support the idea that serotonin is amood elevator “happy hormone,” the industry haslooked for some way to explain the  therapeutic
benefit that they claim. They have generally settledon the idea that the SSRIs, after several weeks ofuse, increase the synthesis of the progesteronemetabolite allopregnanolone, in the brain. 
That does happen, but the synthesis of those
defensive steroids is also increased by any injuryto the brain (di Michele, et al., 2000). Electroshockconvulsive therapy, which is commonly used whensevere depression isn’t relieved after more than ayear of drug treatment, also increases the produc-
tion of those neurosteroids, but at the cost of braincell death. 
The public is slowly becoming aware of the
association of the SSRIs with obesity, sexualmalfunction, hair loss, and osteoporosis, but thatinformation is always put into the context of theirsupposed therapeutic value. If the drugs’ only realvalue is their laxative effect, and the adaptiveneurosteroid synthesis that occurs after any braindamage, then it’s clear that the safer antidepres-sants that are known should be used.  
Although it’s not reflected in the mass media
or the practice of medicine, many studies showthat increased serotonin and tryptophan are associ-ated with depression and suicidality, anxiety,aggression, and violence (de Boer and Koolhaas,2005; van der Vegt, et al., 2003). 
The actual properties of the drugs and the
serotonin system that they distort should beconsidered in relation to each of the epidemicconditions, for example their effect of lengtheningthe heart’s repolarization (QT) interval, which isknown to sometimes cause cardiac arrest, inrelation to the hundreds of thousands of suddencardiac deaths that are occurring annually in theUS, including tens of thousands of apparentlyhealthy young people. How many of those wereusing the drugs?
Serotonin slows oxidative metabolism (in
many animals it’s involved in preparation forhibernation), and reduces the circulation of bloodin the brain (Szabo and Hofmann, 1989; Aleksan-drin, et al., 2005). The reduced use of glucose andoxygen by brain tissue characterizes depression,hypothyroidism, aging, and dementia, as well asthe effects of serotonin produced by stress ortrauma. The lower energy production makes theorganism more susceptible to stress. 
Aerobic glycolysis, the metabolism character-
istic of cancer, in which lactic acid is producedfrom glucose despite the presence of oxygen, ispromoted by serotonin (Balitskii and Vinnitskii,1972; Koren-Schwartzer, et al., 1994; Rudzit, etal., 1968; Kornberg, et al., 2018), and can befound in the autoimmune diseases.
50 to 60 years ago Hans Selye and his associ-
ates were showing that increased serotonin madespecific organs and tissues more susceptible to4stress and degenerative diseases, such as ulceration
and sclerosis. Considering their work in relation tothe current epidemic of female-related diseases, weshould consider the possibility that the SSRIs areamong the causes of this epidemic. 
A recent article on autoimmunity suggests that
prolactin can be considered as a cytokine affectinginflammation in the “autoimmune diseases” suchas multiple sclerosis and SLE, as well as ahormone (Borba, et al., 2019). Since prolactindepends on estrogen, the estrogen industry hasdiscouraged this line of thinking. Whether theissue has been inflammatory bowel disease,autism, Alzheimer’s disease, breast cancer, orrheumatoid arthritis, money for research, advertis-ing, and lobbying has always been able to turnattention away from estrogen as the cause.
Serotonin, along with estrogen, is the major
promoter of prolactin secretion, and it alsopromotes TSH, ACTH, FSH, LH, GH, MSH,POMC, vasopressin, and oxytocin--all the pituitaryhormones. 
Stresses of different sorts increase the forma-
tion of serotonin and the various pituitaryhormones, leading to adaptive changes in theorganism, but at the cost of causing inflammationand degeneration. Studies of several of the pitui-tary hormones have shown age-acceleratingeffects, leading to edema, inflammation, fibrosis,and decreased longevity. W.D. Denckla’s experi-ments showing the great life extending effect ofremoving the pituitary gland, while supplementingthyroid and glucocorticoid hormones, suggest thepossibilities inherent in finding ways to prevent theover-production of serotonin and its associatedhormones and cytokines. 
As it becomes generally known that serotonin
promotes, and that anti-serotonin measures canprevent, alleviate, and sometimes cure most of theproblems caused by stress and serotonindominance--cancer, dementia, arthritis, and dozensof other disabling and killing conditions--the drugindustry’s social and political power will bethreatened.  Their historical behavior suggests thattheir response will be to interfere with the use ofthe safe inexpensive generic substances that solvethose problems. REFERENCES
