IiAtthebeginning ofthe20thcentury(e.g.,HJ
Muller,1910,1921)whennothingwasknown
aboutthephysical orchemical natUteof"the
gene,"manybiologists committed themselves to
thebeliefthat"thegeneisthebasisoflife."(Ann
RevofGeneticsvol.2:1-10,1968,G.Ponteeorvo,
Hennann JosephMullet;page1).Whenitwas
discovered thatx~raysproduced mutations it
seemedobviousthatitwasbecausetheychanged
the"genes," andlaterwhengenescametobe
identified withDNA,itwasbelieved thatradia-
tionhaditsbiological effectsbecause ofits
effectsonDNA,whichcontinued tobethoughtof
as"thebasisoflife."
