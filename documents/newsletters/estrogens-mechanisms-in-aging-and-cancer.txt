Estrogen's Mechanisms in
Aging andCancerThe idea of "estrogen dominance" in
menopause has been accepted bymany people,
but itsapplication totherapy has been very
limited. The ways inwhich nutrition and the
thyroid hormone can lower estrogen production
just aren't being discussed inthe books that
recognize therole ofestrogen dominance inthe
menopause.
Gradually, afew people arerecognizing that
progesterone can beused forother situations in
which estrogen causes sickness. The role ofestro-
gen inepilepsy, depression, circulatory disorders,
and migraine isstarting toberecognized, because
oftheimmediate effects ofsupplemental proges-
terone. Butestrogen's role inemphysema, asthma,
liver and gall-bladder disease, diabetes, arthritis,
strokes, movement disorders, memory problems,
multiple organ failure, and avariety ofinflamma-
tory conditions isbeing neglected, forreasons that
arelargely ideological.
In pregnancy, menstrual disorders, and
menopause, thesituation makes iteasy tothink of
thesexhormones, and theidea ofbalancing two
ofthem seems plausible. Katharina Dalton
popularized theidea that thepremenstrual disor-
der could bediagnosed byfinding amonthly
rhythm inthesymptoms, and treated bytaking
progesterone premenstrually. That was an
extremely important contribution, because it
gradually made doctors realize that the
"syndrome" wasn't just amatter ofmonthly water
retention, asthejournals hadcharacterized it.
But when the sickness doesn't have aclear
monthly rhythm, or isn't associated with
menopause, orisn't cured by supplemental
progesterone, oroccurs inaman orchild, estro-
gen's role caneasily beoverlooked. Ifaproblem
iscaused bystress, or"x-rays, oraging, ora
genetic mutation, some people think estrogen and
progesterone are irrelevant.
This isbecause ofamedical culture and
ideology. Aslong asthat culture defines the
issues, very simple approaches to"insoluble"
health problems aregoing tobeignored.
Ifwelearn toseetheproblems interms ofa
general disorder ofenergy metabolism, wecan
begin tosolve them.
A.The Issues
Before genes were known tobemade ofDNA,
some people spoke ofthenucleus asifitwere the
"brain ofthecell," although many experiments
showed thatidea tobevery misleading.
100 years ago thedoctrine ofWeismannism
explained thedevelopment, from asingle cell, of
organisms with many different kinds ofcell, by
saying that allofthegenes were contained inthe
first cell, butthat asthefertilized eggdivided, the
genes were distributed, divided upsothat each
tissue received only thegenes that itneeded forits
specific structure andfunction.
While thisdoctrine was inforce, thedevelop-
ment oftumors, which often produce cells with
some ofthecharacteristics ofother tissues, was
neatly explained asthegrowth ofafragment that
was "displaced" during theembryo's growth: "an
embryonal rest." Dermoid tumors orpilonidal
cysts are still usually explained asdisplaced
embryonic tissue. Many other things, especially
aneurisms (some aneurisms, e.g., "berry
aneurisms," resemble tumors), that appear atany
point inlifearecommonly described as"congeni-
tal," because ofthegreat and lingering influence
ofWeismannism, which held that developmental
potential existed only inthe"germ line" cells.
These ideas persist inthemedical culture because
oftheuncritical nature ofmedical training.
The doctrine, theculture, ofWeismannism is
behind thedesire tosaythat thenucleus, with its
genes, controls thecell.
The people who like tothink that the"genes
control thecell" have built their more modem
understanding ofhuman and mammalian biology
onideas that were developed inthe1950s and
1960s forexplaining theresponses ofbacteria to
different kinds offood. In bacteria, there isno
distinction between nucleus and cytoplasm, and
their DNA isn't arranged in Theirappropriate adjustments tochanges intheir
environment were explained interms ofregula-
tory molecules that activate and inhibit specific
"Th I' ". eresu tsstrongly suggest thepossibil·
itythat allmRNAs may beexpressed in a'
single human cell, ofboth somatic. and genu
lin " eage. . YoKimoto, 1998-·

genes. (AsIhave mentioned before, thework of
John Cairns [Cairns andFoster, 1991] andothers
hasshown that there issomething fundamentally
wrong with thisidea, even forexplaining bacterial
physiology.)
These ideas were applied toexplaining the
more complex processes that regulate cells that
contain anucleus. The gene-discarding details of
Weismannism were dropped, infavor ofanew
doctrine, inwhich genes were bound upand
inactivated, except when they were specifically
activated according tothe specific needs ofa
tissue.
Hormone receptors were seen asanalogs of
theregulatory molecules inbacteria. The recep-
torsthat thedrug companies talk about arealmost
always understood ill terms ofthe bacterial
regulatory model, inwhich aprotein binds toa
drug orasignal substance, and then moves into
thenucleus where itbinds tospecific genes. (In
thisscheme, thehormone issaid tobe"providing
information" tothecell, regulating the"informa-
tion inthegenes.")
Inneurology, receptors have been used to
explain why allnerves don't respond inthesame
way tomolecules such asadrenaline, acetylcho-
line, and dopamine. During development certain
oftheir genes were activated, producing therecep-
tors that allow them torespond only tocertain
substances.
The two kinds ofreceptor belonged totwo
different cultures--endocrinologists simply
believed that nerves didn't have estrogen recep-
tors, and neurofogists believed that therelevant
gene expression was taken care ofbefore birth.
Both ofthese cultures have turned out tobe
radically mistaken.
Because oftheidea that activation ofgenes by
receptors had toexplain everything, estrogen was
said toactonly through its"receptor protein," and
fordecades most biologists simply denied that
estrogen could have essentially instantaneous
effects oncells, theway nerve transmitters do.As
hundreds of"impossible" facts piled up, the
scientific/medical establishment bent alittle, and
decided that there was another estrogen receptor,
which would account fortheimmediate actions of
estrogen. The alpha and beta estrogen receptors
arenow familiar entities, ifwebelieve what is
being said bymany medical endocrinologists.
But estrogen does many things, and some of
them clearly don't involve either the"alpha" or
"beta" receptor proteins. Rather than making it
easier tounderstand allofestrogen's effects,
another "receptor" isjust another distraction,
making iteasier toignore some oftheunexplained
facts.
What began asareductionist attempt to
explain everything interms ofchance and mecha-
nistic materialism, has resulted inaninfinite
tangle ofassumptions andwild interpretations.
What, specifically, iswrong with theidea
that ahormone binds toand activates arecep-
torprotein which then activates certain genes?
First, ithas been asserted formore than 30
years that this isthe only way ahormone can
work. Afew years ago, thesingle estrogen recep-
torwas supplemented byanother receptor. Inmice
which have been mutated tolack these receptors,
there are still responses toestrogen, and soa
"receptor X"hasbeen proposed. Aslong asacell
ororganism can respond tosomething, itwill be
claimed that there isareceptor forit.
Second, the"classical hormone receptor" idea
claims that thereceptor/response system ishighly
specific, and isactivated byahighly specific
binding ofthehormone tothereceptor, andofthe
complex tothegene.
Third, thedoctrine claims tobesoimportant
that other processes ofregulation and differentia-
tion ofcells areforgotten ortreated asifthey were
trivial.
The first objection isreally anobjection tothe
medieval way ofthinking, inwhich every reaction
has tobereified, turned into aconcrete object.3
This attitude seems tobeuseful ingetting
funding.
The second false claim has been amply
disproved--the range ofthings which canactivate
estrogen receptors isgreat, and theevidence that
falsifies the claim has existed longer than the
identity oftheestrogen molecule hasbeen known.
The third point will besettled byanyone who
investigates the massive amount ofresearch
demonstrating that cell physiology and structure
arethoroughly dependent onprocesses that occur
after the genes have produced their product,
messenger RNA. The stabilization and degrada-
tion oftheRNA, anditsrearrangement and splic-
ing, areclearly very closely connected with the
cell's nature andfunction.
There might turn outtobemany interesting
"repressors" and "activators" ofspecific genes,
that conform tothestandard bacterial model, but
that hasn't been what thedrug industry wants us
tobelieve. They have aninterest inselling the
idea that hormones and drugs have aspecific
ability to"unlock" certain genes. Estrogen might
nolonger unlock the"femininity genes," butitis
supposed tounlock the genes that protect the
bones, heart, and brain. The "estrogen receptor"
no longer has anything atall todo with
femininity. Itisfound inevery organ ofboth men
and women. When amutant mouse was produced
that lacked anestrogen receptor, testicular edema
was one ofthemost noticeable problems. (There
might be reason tothink this indicates an
increased activity ofestrogen intheabsence of
thereceptor: SeeSowerbutts, etal.,1986).
The conversion ofestrogen, inthe early
1960s, from something that "increased fertility" to
something that prevents fertility, started aprocess
that convinced the industry that they should
concentrate their sales effort onwomen who are
already infertile. That probably saved theindustry
from extinction, since theuseofestrogen during
pregnancy caused notonly miscarriages, butalso
birth defects and cancer and other diseases inthe
children. But the present claims that estrogen
activates specific genes that protect the aging
tissues will eventually sound asfoolish astheidea
of"femininity genes" does now.
Without thereceptor doctrine, theintroduction
ofnew drugs might require evidence ofactual
health benefits.
Thefacts ofhormonal control ofcellfunction
aremuch more interesting than thesimple recep-
tordogma.
B.Some Evidence
Within thelast few years, anew technique
(reverse transcriptase-polymer chain reaction) has
made itpossible todetect very small amounts of
RNA, toshow inavery clear way whether certain
genes inasingle cellareactive.
Y.Kimoto hasapplied thetesttoseveral very
different types ofcell. Some genes involved in
energy production and the basic maintenance
systems areknown tobeactive inallsorts ofcells,
butother genes, such asthose thatareresponsible
forthehighly specialized functions ofmature
tissues, arebelieved tobeinoperative intissues
with adifferent kind ofspecialization. Heshowed
thatallofthe25types ofRNA, formaking very
different kinds ofprotein, were present ineach
type ofcell. "These findings strongly suggest
that every cellcanexpress every mRNA. Beneath
the cell differentiation there may exist a
DNA->RNA basal constant flow ...."
Ifalloftheorganism's genes arealways active
inevery cell, then thequestion isclearly "what
really governs thecell's differentiation, and the
varying expression of the genes' protein
products?"
When acelldoesn't need aparticular kind of
RNA, it isdegraded almost instantly. When itis
pressured toadapt inacertain direction, theRNA
formaking theadaptive proteins becomes very
stable, andaccumulates.
Asimilar process occurs with proteins,
degrading them quickly, orprotecting them. In
many enzymes, avitamin orother coenzyme binds
totheprotein andstabilizes it.
Ifthe enzymic activity ischanged inthe
presence ofahormone, many people have
assumed thatnew proteins with different functions
were produced byactivation ofgenes, butinmany
cases, hormones (like vitamins) directly alter the
functions ofenzymes.4
Inthe 1960s, Engel and hiscollaborators
showed that estrogen binds toseveral enzymes,
and that theassociation ofestrogen with the
enzyme alters thecell's chemistry, including the
balance between oxidation andreduction. These
enzymes could very properly becalled "estrogen
receptors," because they mediate the cell's
response toestrogen. Butthegeneral atmosphere
was such that only receptors which moved into
the nucleus and bound toagene could be
accepted. Everything hadtobeexplained bythe
prestigious bacterial model.
Nevertheless, inthe1960s and earlier there
were other people who could demonstrate that
basic changes inthecell's chemistry altered the
expression ofgenes. C.D. Cone, Jr.,showed that
osmotic forces and thecell's surface electrical
potential, which hemanipulated byadjusting the
ratio ofsodium topotassium, could powerfully
activate thegenes. Hedemonstrated thateven the
nuclei ofbrain cells could bestimulated to
undergo mitosis, duplicating their DNA asaresult
ofasimple change ofthesaltbalance.
Around 1985, stress (high temperature, or
deprivation ofoxygen orglucose, forexanlple)
wasfound toalter gene expression inasystematic
way. Itturned outthat estrogen activates these
same "stress proteins."
This was particularly interesting, since many
years earlier itwas demonstrated thatmany kinds
ofstress imitated thefunction ofestrogen. Suffo-
cation orx-ray exposure (ofthebrain, orovary, or
anypart ofthebody) would trigger thelordosis
reaction, forexample. More recently, ithasbeen
noticed that amoderate x-ray exposure ofthe
brain canbring onpremature puberty ingirls. And
irradiation (x-rays, gan1ffia rays, orultraviolet
rays) synergizes inother ways with estrogen, for
example incausing cancer.
The estrogen receptor, even without any
estrogen, will still move into thenucleus and
bind tothegenes, under thestress ofoxygen
deprivation. This isconsistent with theidea that
estrogen isdoing something tothecellthatresem-
bles thechanges produced bytheother stressors.
Under more objective circumstances, the"estro-
genreceptor" might have been identified asjust
another 9fthecomponents inastress response.
Heat shock canincrease thenumber ofestro-
genreceptors (Marin, etal.,2001). Estrogen, too,
generally increases thequantity oftheestrogen
receptor protein.
Testosterone, thyroid, cortisone areknown to
stabilize certain RNAs, causing theexpression of
gene products without necessarily doing anything
directly tothegene. The overwhelming emphasis
inresearch now seems tobeonthefactors that
regulate the stability ofRNA, rather than onthe
simpler bacterial model ofgene activation.
In1996, many people spoke oftheoriginal
estrogen receptor asifitmoved "from the
membrane" through thecytoplasm tothenucleus,
because ofahabit ofthinking ofthecellsurface as
a"membranous barrier." Buttheprotein thatthey
identified astheir estrogen receptor was inthe
cytoplasm.
Formore than 30years, people hadbeen notic-
ingthat estrogen had many effects that were
practically instantaneous, for example causing
cells totake upwater and alter their electrical
behavor. Cone's work demonstrated thatthecell's
water content and electrical behavior could
activate thenucleus, soIdidn't seetheneed for
having separate explanations forregulating water,
ions, electrical potentials, andgenetic expression.
ButtheOther Major Dogma ofcell biology
hasbeen that "the plasma membrane" regulates
everything. When people heard about estrogen's
orprogesterone's orthethyroid hormone's instan-
taneous actions, they thought itmust bea
membrane-controlled response.
V.D. Ramirez and hiscollaborators began
talking about thereality ofasecond estrogen
receptor, the beta receptor, ormembrane-
associated receptor. (The original "gene activating
receptor" hasnow become thealpha receptor.)
Their definition of"membrane" was very
standard: First you homogenize thetissue, and
then centrifuge it,andcertain layers ofthesludge
arecalled membranes. That's because ofthe tradi-
tion inwhich membranes served toenclose the
"watery" cytoplasm, sonaturally they were the
part thatwasn't watery, i.e.,they were theinsolu-
ble lump left after homogenization and
centrifugation.5
Butthey identified several proteins thatestro-
gen stuck to:ATPase (regulating energy and
saltand water), and GAPDH, therate control-
ling enzyme ofglycolysis. Estrogen activates
this enzyme, and physiologically estrogen
activates theglycolytic pathway, increasing the
production oflactic acid asitshifts metabolism
away from mitochondrial oxidation, lowering
thecell's ATP production, and shifts theuseof
oxygen functions, such asproducing nitric
oxide, the free radical which isacommon
mediator for all the harmful forms of
radiation, andforoxygen deprivation.
This particular enzyme interests me, because
ofitsfunction incontrolling glycolysis, butalso
because itisinactivated bycold, along with other
important enzymes involved inthe estrogen
reaction. In1971 Iproposed that estrogen
activated this enzyme byaltering the"structural
temperature" ofthecellwater, something which
paralleled C.D. Cone, Jr.'s sodium/electrical
effects, that is,itwould beaholistic shift inthe
way the insoluble ("membrane") proteins
behaved, making them more insoluble or
hydrophobic.
But Ramirez's group, like Engel's, was
suggesting that thebinding ofestrogen tothe
enzymes, changing their activity, was theregula-
tory principle, which doesn't make too much
difference, since thevarious interpretations endup
causing thesame metabolic shifts, toward the
metabolism ofstress, orcancer, orestrogen
dominance. The shift ofmetabolism toward lactic
acid production andlower energy production will
also cause some holistic changes, such aschang-
ingtheredox balance, possibly increasing thepH,
andlowering theenergy charge. However, Ithink
achange inthecell's hydrophobicity orstructural
temperature would also make coherent changes in
thestability ofRNA aswell asofproteins.
The activation oftheother enzyme, ATPase,
inRamirez's experiments, iseven more suppor-
tiveoftheidea thatestrogen ismodifying thecell
water, lowering itsorder the way increased
temperature would. Inthe mitochondrion, the
enzyme that synthesizes ATP (ATP synthetase)
willalsodestroy ATP, ifconditions arechanged.
The three main conditions that cause the
enzyme todestroy ATPareprolonged standing
after separating themitochondria from thecells,
freezing the mitochondria and then slowly
thawing them (messing them upmore thoroughly
than when they arerapidly thawed), andtreating
them with estrogen.
Destroying thecell's ATP atahigh rateisan
important factor inforcing the cell togetits
energy from glycolysis, producing lactic acid.
Allofthestages involved inthedevelopment
ofcancer arepromoted byestrogen. Forexample,
thelocal acidification produced bylactic acid
production promotes invasiveness, byactivating
proteolytic enzymes.
The mere presence oflactic acid intheblood
displaces carbon dioxide, with many harmful
consquences (allofwhich areseen intheestrogen
dominant state). Carbon dioxide isineffect our
basic protection against free radical damage.
(Boljevic, etal.,1996.) Carbon dioxide isgener-
allythought tobeamajor factor inregulating the
balance ofwater inthebody. Forexample, hyper-
ventilation increases capillary leakiness, and
causes fluid toleak outinto thetissues. Estrogen
decreases carbon dioxide bycausing hyperventila-
tion andincreased lactic acid production. Estro-
gen systemically increases capillary leakiness.
(Cho, etal.,1999; Ziylan, etal.,1990; Reid, etal.,
1983; Merlen, 1982.) The capillary leakiness is
corrected byprogesterone. (Lagrue, etal.,1983.)
The idea that estrogen increases thestructural
temperature ofcell water, even while thereal
temperature might bedecreasing, would be
consistent with thefact that the"heat shock" or
stress proteins are expressed under estrogen's
influence. And when, under theinfluence ofestro-
genortheunsaturated fatty acids, cells take up
more water, they also take upalittle sodium. This
reduces the organizing influence ofthe cell's
proteins onthewater, andthisiswhat increases its
structural temperature. When thenervous system,
responding toestrogen, "sets the thermostate
lower," there isaslight restoration ofthecell's
water and protein interactions, but metabolic
processes areslowed atthelower temperature.
Estrogen, like radiation and oxygen depriva-
tion, increases formation ofthenitric oxide (NO)6
free radical, which hassomany harmful effects,
ranging from damaging DNA topoisoning
mitochondria. One ofthe consequences of
increasing NO formation (and estrogen) isthe
activation ofanenzyme (heme oxygenase) which
produces carbon monoxide, inthe process of
breaking down the heme molecule (which is
needed forrespiratory enzymes, among other
essential functions). Inprevious newsletters Ihave
discussed thereasons forthinking that endoge-
nously produced carbon monoxide could explain
thegradual development ofcancer, since itstabi-
lizes cells inthe primitive anti-respiratory
condition.
Any injury that anorganism can survive is
likely toactivate thedefensive systems, increasing
theorganism's ability tosurvive asubsequent
stress (e.g., Meerson, etal.,1991), andthisseems
toexplain why estrogen treatment sometimes has
aprotective effect. Inahealthy menstrual cycle,
estrogen's dominance ispresent forjust afew
hours, andthisshort stimulus serves tostimulate
compensatory production ofprogesterone. Ever
since Lipshutz's experiments inthe1940s, ithas
been known thatitistheprolonged, uninterrupted
action ofestrogen that isprofoundly harmful, not
thebrief cyclical exposures.
It's the prolonged shock-like state that
contributes tothedegenerative diseases, which
typically begin with asortofdiabetes, aninability
touseglucose forenergy because oftheaccumu-
lation oftoomuch ofthewrong kind offat.
C.Protective Measures
The avoidance ofstress isthebasic principle
forpreventing thedevelopment oftheestrogen-
dominant state. Since darkness isitself astress,
generally increased exposure tostrong light thatis
richinthelong-wave partofthespectrum, yellow
tored, isprotective, since these frequencies
restore enzymes damaged bystress. Avoiding
ionizing radiation whenever possible isvery
important, and this includes especially
medical/dental x-rays, which arealmost always
unnecessary .
The polyunsaturated fats, toxic heavy metals,
andinappropriate amounts ofcertain amino acids,
such astryptophan, cysteine, leucine, and,.
glutamate, increase oursensitivity tostress ofall
sorts, including radiation, and soshould be
avoided asfaraspossible. Coconut oilorpalm
kernel oil(which iseven more saturated than
coconut oil,with agenerous supply oftheshort
fatty acids) should beused regularly, since itisn't
possible toavoid the toxic unsaturated fats
entirely. (Generally, starchy food should be
avoided, forseveral reasons: Persorption, obesity,
andthenature ofthefoods thatcontain them.)
Many drugs thatarecurrently popular decrease
stress resistance. Afewdrugs areprotective inthe
short term, butaretoxic ifused foralong time.
Aspirin protects against some oftheworst stres-
sors, including thepolyunsaturated fats, sodespite
itsmild toxicity, long term studies usually show
thatitdecreases sickness andmortality. Antibiot-
ics,though they aretoxic inthemselves, alsohave
powerful antistress effects.
Instress, magnesium and sodium arelost
rapidly, sothediet should contain foods such as
fruits andmeats that contain significant amounts
ofmagnesium. Added sodium helps tospare
magnesium.
Occasional useofliver, toassure agenerous
supply ofvitamins and trace minerals, issafer
than using chemical supplements. Niacin and
thiamine help tocorrect some ofthemetabolic
distortions created bystress orestrogen.
The specifically antiestrogenic hormones,
thyroid (especially T3), pregnenolone, andproges-
terone, can compensate tosome extent for
exposure toanyofthestressors, including ioniz-
ingradiation.

Expression ofheavy-chain constant region ofimmuno-
globulin and T-cell receptor gene transcripts inhuman
non-hematopoietic tumor celllines. Kimoto Y.Expression
ofgene transcripts forimmunoglobulins andaT-cell recep-
torwas investigated innon.·hematopoietic tumor ('.ell lincs
using thehighly sensitive RT-nested PCR method. These
proteins are reported tobeproduced and secreted or
expressed inmalignancies originating trom hematopoietic
organs only. Originally designed PCR primers fordifferent
exons coding fortheheavy-chain constant regions ofIgM,
IgD, IgG3, IgGl, 19E, and19AandtheT-cell receptor-alpha
were used. Allgene transcripts were detected inthe5inves-
tigated cancer cell lines without exception. The results
suggest thateven non-hematopoietic cancer cells transcribe
immunoglobulin andT-cell receptor genes andmay produce
thecorresponding proteins.
