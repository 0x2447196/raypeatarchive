David Vesely, 2008Peptides, coherent adaptation,
and some terminal diseases: The
roles ofthyroid, progesterone, calcium,
salt--issues ofenergy and inflammation;
.towards anorganismic paradigm for
medicine
Inthelast50years, huge numbers ofpeople
have probably suffered needlessly and died
prematurely because ofamistaken bio-medical
ideology. Much ofthatideology hasbeen deliber-
ately imposed byacorrupt drug industry, which
effectively controls theregulatory agencies, major
medical journals andtexts, andtheway themass
media treat scientific ideas.
Scientific reductionism fosters specialization,
andspecialization leaves the"big picture" suscep-
.tible tomanipulation bythose with financial and
political power.
The practice ofmedicine isstill based on
mechanistic biological doctrines, butsome ofthe
coherent holistic approaches thatdisappeared after
thesecond world war arebeing vindicated by
recent research.
Intreating heart disease, it's common to
prescribe one drug tomodify theheart's contrac-
tions, another drug tomodify the kidneys'
handling ofwater and sodium, another drug that
modifies thetension oftheblood vessels, and a
drug toinhibit blood clotting. Intreating cancer,
drugs tokilltumor cells areoften combined with
drugs totreat theside effects ofthetoxic drugs,
and other drugs totreat symptoms produced by
thecancer. Each drug hasitsparticular "indica-
tions," andthewhole process seems tobelogical
andrational, aslong asthedoctor participates in
themechanistic culture that describes theorgan-
ismandeach drug's effect ontheorganism.
Epilepsy, diabetes, osteoporosis, depression,
boils, arthritis, insomnia, etc., allhave their
special mechanisms andspecial drugs.
When apracticing physician isconfronted bya
patient who istrying tothink about theproblem
coherently, interms ofthings thatwere known" in
1940 orthat have been recently discovered, it's
extremely unlikely that thephysician will take the
time, orhave themental flexibility, toconsider the
patient's perspective.
There isnothing inthepresent medical culture
that would allow aphysician toconsider that a
common substance such asprogesterone, or
thyroid, orcalcium, orsugar, might beable to
prevent oralleviate orcure some orallofthe
"conditions mentioned above. But there aresome
clearly established facts thathave thepotential of
radically changing medical culture.
The idea ofcell ("tissue streaming")
with coordinated multiplication ofstem cells and
safe dissolution (apoptosis) and recycling of
mature cells hasnow reached mainstream biology,
despite some occasional lip-service tothe
"Hayflick limit," which submerged the idea of
continuous tissue renewal for40years. The idea
oftissue-specific regulators ofcelldivision (e.g.,
W.S. Bullough's chalones) was incompatible with
the Hayflick doctrine that mature cells were
incapable ofdividing, and with the cancer
doctrine, that only genetic mutant cells were able
tocontinue dividing beyond theHayflick limit of
50divisions. But now, there isgreat interest in
studying themany specific andgeneral factors that
regulate stem cells, differentiation, and apoptosis
inthemature animal.
Some ofthese basic regulatory systems that
have been ignored forsolong turn out tobe
processes that wehave incommon with allforms
oflife.
Every cell contains proteolytic enzymes that
break down enzymes and other proteins asnew
proteins aremade. These changes allow thecellto
adapt tochanges initsenvironment, such as
different energy sources. During stress, these
enzymes areactivated sothatnew systems canbe
quickly formed tomeet thestress. When thestress
issointense that the cell isunable toadapt,
enzymes ofthis sort break down the cell's2
structure, andthesynthesis ofnew proteins stops,
causing thecelltodecompose inanorderly way.
More intense and sudden stress cancause aless
orderly kind ofcellular death, buttheproteolytic
ehzymesparticipate inthat kind ofdissolution
too, though thepeptide fragments produced are
different.
Bacteria growing incolonies function insome
ways like multicellular organisms, and the
adaptive processes, including cell dissolution
when thesupply offood isdepleted, allow the
events inanindividual cell tocontribute tothe
regulation ofthecolony (Ben Jacob, etal.,2004).
The peptide fragments that regulate bacterial
colonies also influence theinteractions between
bacteria and more complex organisms, because
stress-induced proteolysis isauniversal feature of
life, and very different organisms respond in
similar ways tocertain kinds offragmented
proteins.
The injury-induced alarm reactions that
activate proteolytic enzymes incomplex organ-
isms typically release peptide fragments that are
toxic tobacteria (possibly inasortof"excitotox-
icity"), and prevent their growth and invasion,
while atthe same time they stimulate wound
healing andlocal cell division; ifthelocal injury
isserious enough, anamplified inflammatory
reaction caninvolve thewhole organism, itswhite
blood cells andadaptive antibody production and
hormonal andnervous reactions.
This kind of"innate immunity" issomething
we have incommon with allforms oflife.
Coupled tothealarm/inflammatory system, there
aremore specific protective systems ofregulatory
peptides, that happen tobecalled "natriuretic
peptides," although they domuch more than
regulating thekidneys' handling ofsodium. They
were first discovered intheatria ofhearts, andso
were called "atrial natriuretic peptide," ANP, but
then peptides with similar structure and effects
were found inthebrain, andcalled "brain natriu-
retic peptide," BNP, and the next type tobe
discovered was called CNP.
Very similar peptides occur inmollusks,
insects, reptiles, plants, andmammals, apparently
inallmulticellular organisms, andtheir functions
inthose organisms haven't been clarified, buttheir
universality hasstimulated interest illexploring
their multiple functions.
Many immunologists think of "innate
immunity" asaprimitive system that serves to
activate the"higher" "adaptive immune system" of
vertebrates. Amajor difference between these two
systems issupposed tobetheabsence ofmemory
intheinnate system. Inthe1950s, experimenters
applied alittle copper sulfate totheleafofaplant,
inaconcentration just high enough toinjure the
tissue ittouched. Then several days later, applica-
tion ofahighly diluted solution ofthesame
chemical was found tocause anintense reaction
andinjury. Theplant's "primitive" immUD;e system
demonstrated memory. "Stress memory" inplants
isnow more widely recognized (Goh, etal.,
2003). Recent evidence (Bouche, etal.,2003;.
Baluska, etal.,2004; Bais, etaI.,2004; Wipf, et
aI., 2002) supports J.C.Bose's early work
showing nerve-like functions inplants.
In1908, llya Mechnikov (also written Elie
Metchnikoff) and Paul Ehrlich shared theNobel
prize forphysiology ormedicine, fortheir work
onimmunity.
Ehrlich isconsidered. apioneer inchemother-
apy. Hisearly work using synthetic dyes tostain
bacteria andblood cells ledhim totheidea ofa
"magic bullet," inwhich atoxic substance (such
ascertain ofthedyes thatwere being produced by
theGerman chemical industry) would selectively
killaparticular pathogen. Hisideas ledeventually
tothecurrent theory ofusing monoclonal antibod-
iesas"magic bullets" tokillcancer cells.
Mechnikov was investigating embryology,
trying tounderstand the principles bywhich
ananimal develops, when herealized that
nutrition, especially theprocess ofintracellular
digestion ofproteins, was aguiding force inthe
development oftheorganism, and later, consid-
ering theprocess ofphagocytosis, hesaw that
this same principle was centrally involved in
the organism's resistance toinjury and infec-
tion. From seeing theplace ofcellular digestion
and nutrition inthegrowth and survival ofthe
organism, heextended hisstudies totheproblem
ofthefactors that influence theorganism's resis-
tance, forexample why poor people areespecially
susceptible toinfectious disease, andhow toxins3
absorbed from theintestine weaken resistance to
infections, andcontribute toaging.
Acquired immunity, existing after recovering
from aninfection orbeing vaccinated, was well
known toMechnikov (heworked with Pasteur, for
example), buthedidn't make theextreme distinc-
tionbetween innate andadaptive immunity thatis
now often made. .
ForMechnikov, themovement ofcells from
connective tissues into theblood, andfrom the
blood into theendothelial andconnective tissues,
destroying harmful extraneous material orcells
thatwere nolonger useful, wasanintegral physio-
logical process, influenced bythenervous system,
tofomi andsustain theorganism.
Although some ofhiscontemporaries saw
cellular immunity asasort ofmechanical and
autonomous system (and some denounced him as
a"vitalist" because oftheintelligence hesawin
cellular behavior), Mechnikov insisted that the
processes ofimmunity were integral organismic
processes, inwhich thenervous system hadan
essential role. Over theyears, there have been
many demonstrations ofthebrain's importance in
the inflammatory process, but even the.most
recent studies that have found that
"neuropeptides" appear tofunction aspartofthe
"innate immune system" haven't achieved the
comprehensive view ofthe organism that
Mechnikov had.
Contemporary immunology andmedicine see
the.immune system largely asEhrlich sawit,asa
specialized killing system. Like Ehrlich, few
medical immunologists are interested inthe
similarities between plants andanimals, because
they seethehuman immune system asaunique
thing evolved tomore effectively destroy things
which are"not-self."
The alternative view, that hasgrown outof
Mechnikov's work, sees that theadaptiveness of
plants andinvertebrate animals gives usanessen-
tial perspective onour own biology. Growth,
regeneration, stem cells, learning, andaging, have
tobetaken into account when thinking about
infections, vaccinations, and the"autoimmune"
diseases. We, humans andvertebrates generally,
have avery intense energy metabolism that
requires apowerful circulatory system that
supports acomplex nervous system, but the
similarities oftheimmune systems ofthedifferent
phyla areinsome ways more important than the
differences. Learning orimprinting issomething
that canoccur inanykind ofcell, andtheimpor-
tance ofthe"simple" regulatory peptides ofthe
innate immune system isnow starting toberecog-
nized inmedicine.
Allofourtissues, when damaged, canproduce
inflammation, stimulate growth, andsignal tothe
restoftheorganism that something iswrong. All,
ormost, ofourtissues arealso able toproduce
substances, the"natriuretic peptides," that restore
stability, byreducing inflammation, inhibiting
abnonnal growth, increasing phagocytosis, and
balancing e:oergetic andsynthetic metabolism and
structural processes, including cellular differentia-
tion, throughout thebody.
The existence ofthese peptides intheother
multicellular organisms, and thediscovery that
they actonpathogens (Krause, etai.2001) aswell
asontheconsequences ofinjury, suggests that
they can beconsidered aspart ofthe"immune
system," butthatrecognition needn't detract from
their roles indevelopmental, reproductive, and
other basic biological processes. Inthetradition of
Mechnikov, itwoulci bebetter todescribe them as
"morpho static peptides," referring to Jamie
Cunliffe's view ofimmunity, or"morphogenic
peptides," toacknowledge thatdevelopment never
stops.
Cells that were once thought tocause autoim-
mune destruction arenow known tobeinvolved
inrepair and regeneration (Hofstetter, etal.,
2003). Antibodies, rather than being just germ ..
killing proteins, ordestructive autoantibodies,
have many other functions, including theregula-
tion ofinflammation andregeneration (del Barco,
etal.,2008; Bieber, etal.,2001; Schwartz, 2000).
Phagocytes, besides eliminating foreign matter
andexhausted cells, areconsidered tobe"antigen
presenting" cells that guide theadaptive immune
system, butthey also have animportant role in
.guiding regeneration and differentiation ofstem
cells.
L.V. Polezhaev showed that processes similar
toembryonic induction, guided byphagocytes, are
involved intheorganism's responses todamaged4
tissues. For example, when apiece ofkilled
muscle tissue was enclosed inaporous capsule
that permits molecules, butnocells, todiffuse
through it,and implanted subcutaneously, ithad
noinductive effect onsurrounding cells. But
when thepores ofthecapsule allowed cells to
enter, skeletal muscle formed where the dead
tissue had been, and tissue resembling heart
muscle formed outside thecapsule. Phagocytosis
hadbeen essential fortheinduction tooccur. The
ingested material guided thedifferentiation ofthe
surrounding cells.
The phagocytosis function isn't limited tothe
blood cells commonly called phagocytes; even .
nerve cells caningest particles andfragments of
damaged tissues. Polezhaev believed that fats
were aninmportant factor instimulating regenera-
tion, andrecent research shows thatsaturated fats
andunsaturated fatshave very different effects on
theantigen presenting cells (Shaikh, etaI.,2008).
The innate immune system isprobably impaired
asaresult ofthe cumulative toxicity ofthe
polyunsaturated fats, contributing totheproblems
ofaging.
Unsaturated fatty acids inhibit phagocytosis
(Guimaraes, etal.,1991, 1992; Costa Rosa, etaI.,
1996; Virella, etal., 1989; Akamatsu, etal.,
1990), and accumulate with aging. Phagocytosis
decreases with aging, while other immune
functions may increase. The agepigment, lipofus-
cin,consisting largely ofoxidized polyunsaturated
fats, impairs thephagocytic function even before
itbecomes grossly visible. The highly oxidizable
n-3 polyunsaturated fats (Virella, etal.,1989)
appear tobethemost harmful toimmunity against·
infections such astuberculosis (paul, etal.,1997).
ANP activates thephagocytic processes, while
inhibiting inflammation (Bonin, etal.2008;
Vollmar, etal.,1997).
The useofoneofthese nontoxic natriuretic
peptides (BNP) asadrug fortreating heart failure
has possibly been helpful (Mohammed, etal.,
2008), andnow others have been discovered tobe
very active against cancer (Vesely, etal.,2006,
2008), butitshouldn't benecessary towait for
their availability asdrugs, since their secretion can
beinduced byordinary physiological means.
Mechnikov and hiscontemporaries concentrated
mainly ontrying toreduce theabsorption ofbacte-
rialtoxins from theintestine topreserve orrestore
thebasic defensive andrestorative processes, but
inthelastcentury new approaches have become
possible.
Since these peptides were called "natriuretic"
because oftheir effects onsaltandwater regula-
tion, itseems reasonable toconsider them insitua-
tions inwhich there are problems with the
regulation .ofwater and salt. Premenstrual
syndrome, preeclampsia orpregnancy hyperten-
sion, congestive heart failure, brain swelling and
seizures allinvolve disturbances ofsaltandwater
regulation, butthemechanical medical tradition
hasalmost always substituted beliefs forfacts.
Because ofbeliefs about cellphysiology, most
medical publications have argued for sodium
restriction inthose situations, buttheevidence is
clear that inadequate salt retention isusually
their outstanding pathological feature,
Progesterone hasbeen aneffective treatment
inallofthose conditions, and itincreases the
ability ofthekidneys toretain sodium. Progester-
one increases ANP, and together they prevent
sodium loss. (Because ofthis, itwould bebetter to
think ofANP asanantinatriuretic, rather than a
natriuretic, peptide.) Each ofthem helps to
prevent excessive vascular permeability
(leakiness), and to thesecretion ofthe
antidiuretic hormone (ADH, orvasopressin) from
thepituitary. ADHcauses sodium loss, water
retention, vascular leakiness, and constriction of
arterioles, increasing blood pressure while
decreasing thedelivery ofoxygen tothetissues,
and increasing the tendency ofblood toclot
inappropriately.
Drugs toantagonize ADH areavailable, and
aresometimes used totreat heart failure; these
drugs help toincrease sodium retention. Aldoster-
oneantagonists (synthetic variations ofprogester-
one) arealso used totreat heart failure; they cause
sodium todecrease. Progesterone, andtheANP it
stimulates, would inhibit both ADH andaldoster-
one, regulating sodium and blood pressure and
improving kidney function, while (like digitalis)
progesterone strengthens theheart's contraction.
The reason progesterone isn't used seems tobe
thatnodrug company promotes itsuse.5
Estrogen isoften recomrilended to"protect the
heart," andeven totreat heart failure, butitlowers
ANP, increases ADH/vasopressin, causes water
retention andsodium loss, vascular leakiness, and
(like aldosterone) weakens theheart's contraction.
.Part ofestrogen's action oncapillaries results
from increasing thevascular permeability factor
(VPF), which isnow called vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF). This growth factor
contributes todegenerative problems including
diabetes, glaucoma, arthritis, atherosclerosis, and
cancer, and blocking itcan cause cancers to
regress. ANP blocks theproduction andvascular
action ofVEGF (pedram, etal.,2006). Both ANP
and BNP protect against excessive permeability
(Klinger, etal.,2006).
Thyroid hormone, like progesterone, also
increases ANP, and, probably acting through
increased carbon dioxide, isessential forregulat-
ing. sodium and water. Hypertonic sodium
chloride and increased carbon dioxide, in
themselves, increase the formation ofANP.
Caffeine isanother substance which inhibits
VEGF, while increasing ANP.
When animbalance ofthese hormones allows
toomuch sodium tobelost, andtoomuch water
toberetained, thephagocytic cells swell, andtheir
autophagic and phagocytic activity isimpaired,
making theorganism more susceptible toinfec-
tion. Simply correcting theosmotic balance by
supplementing saltcanimprove immune function
(Junger, etal.,1994), asitstimulates respiratory
metabolism, and increases carbon dioxide and
body temperature. Increased carbon dioxide
promotes tissue remodeling, lowers stress, and
increases thesynthesis ofANP (Kukacka, etal.,
2007).
ANP protects against stress-induced ex«itatory
effects ofcalcium (Green, etal.,2007; Kuribay-
ashi, etal.,2006; Tian andYang, 2006; Yoshioka,
etal.,2000; Wang, etal.,1993).
Intracellular calcium overload isanessential
feature ofheart failure andhypertrophy (Malyshev
TIu,Meerson, 1990). Both vitamin Dandvitamin
Krequire carbon dioxide fordisposing ofcalcium
properly, preventing itstoxicity. When carbon
dioxide isinadequate, forexample from simple·
hyperventilation orfrom hypothyroidism, calcium
isallowed toenter cells, causing inappropriate
excitation, sometimes followed bycalcification.
Keeping anoptimal level ofcarbon" dioxide
(for example, when adapted tohigh altitude)
causes calcium tobecontrolled (Arkhipenko, et
al., 1992), resulting inlowered parathyroid
hormone (PH!), aneffect similar tosupplement-
ingwith calcium, vitamin D,andvitamin K.(E.g.,
Nicolaidou, etaI,2006.) The contribution ofPTH
toinflammation and degeneration isjust being
acknowledged (e.g., Kuwabara, 2008). It
suppresses phagocytosis (Esposito, etal.,1988;
Smogorzewski, etal.,2001), probably bycausing
calcium overload, butinother situations itstimu-
lates proliferation oflymphocytes and Tcells
(Klinger, etal.,1990;" Adachi, etal.,1990).
The thyroid hormone, producing carbon
dioxide, helps tosustain the level ofionized
calcium (Lindblom, etal.,2001). Inavitamin D
deficiency, oracalcium deficiency, theparathy-
roid hormone increases, and this hormone can
contribute tomany inflammatory anddegenerative
processes, including heart failure (Smogorzewski,
1995; Halapas, etal.,2006; Sugimoto, etal.,
2008) andcardiac hypertrophy (Liu, etal.,2008).
ANP and PTH have opposite effects oncellular
calcium handling, andincreasing theoralintake of
calcium increases ANP (Halabe, etal.,1990), but
lowers PTH.
Consuming enough andvitamin Dto
keep theparathyroid hormone suppressed (and to
support ANP) isimportant toprotect against the
degenerative conditions.
Inorganisms with alower rateofmetabolism,
theregulatory substances aremore closely associ-
ated with theorganisms' structure, butinhomeo-
thermic animals with ahigh rate ofmetabolism,
nerves andcirculating hormones serve toreinforce
thebasic processes ofimmunity, allowing the
whole organism toadapt coherently tosudden"
changes initssituation. These hormonal and
nervous systems have "polarities" that areanalo-
gous tothose oftheinnate peptide system, i.e.,
oneside todefend andalarm andpromote growth,
another side torestore coherence and functions.
The defensins arebalanced bythe "natriuretic
peptides," while estrogen, VEGF, and ADH are
balanced byprogesterone andthyroid, andbythe6
osmolarity, carbon dioxide, and heat that they
sustain. Theantimicrobials accelerate healing, but
they alsostimulate tumor growth, when they aren't
balanced bytheopposing systems.
Mechnikov wasright inseeing bacterial toxins
from theintestine asacause ofaging, andhewas
ontheright track intrying tointroduce amore
beneficial bacterial ecology into theintestine by
using sour milk. The lactobacilli dohave some
protective effects, butthelactic acid that they
produce turns outtofunction asanalarm signal,
which accelerates thesame aging processes that
theother bacterial endotoxins produce.
When these simple physical and chemical
factors arewell balanced, metabolism renews the
structure oftheorganism, directing thedifferen-
tiation ofnew cells andadjusting thecomposition
oftheintercellular substance, according tothe
type ofstress theorganism isexperiencing.
Mechnikov's emphasis onthedevelopmental,
formative nature oftheimmune system, combin-
ingembryology and nutritional physiology with
immunity, created thefoundation fortheunder-
standing ofregeneration and stem cellfunctions.
Wandering cells can become structural parts of
thefixed tissues andorgans (Rohde, etaI.,2007),
orthey can remove debris and call formore
phagocytic· cells, orthey can signal forreplace-
ment stem cells andguide their differentiation.
Local-systemic interactions, inwhich local"
events cause systemic changes, and systemic
events cause local changes, have been neglected
andmisinterpreted, especially where the"immune
system" isconcerned.
Therecent renewal ofinterest ininflammation
asabasic cause ofchronic and degenerative
disease, isafirst step toward anintegral
ticsystem, even though thesystemic restorative
processes arestillbeing neglected.
Bacterial endotoxins areprobably thecentral
problem, butpolyunsaturated fats, heavy metals,
and extraneous hormones interact with them,"
extending their toxic actions.
Reducing thetoxic factors, relative tothe
restorative factors, should betheaim, rather than
looking foranother drug.
When even anatural, endogenous substance is
used as"adrug," theway itisconceptualized and
named islikely toreinforce the mechanical
models oftheorganism, and those models are
always inadequate. Ifweseehealth problems as
events inanorganism's adaptation toaproblem-
atic environment, the focus isshifted tothe
defects inthe environment that might be
remedied.

Calcium, vitamin D,and colon cancer. Newmark HL,

lialcells through allphases oftheproliferative cycle .and
intostages ofcelldifferentiation; intracellular concentra-
tions ofcalcium that are required forcell renewal,
however, arelower than those required forepithelial-
cell differentiation." "In rodent models, increased
dietary calcium inhibited hyperproliferation ofcolon
epithelial cells induced byincreased levels offatty acids
orbile acids present inthecolon. When carcinogens
induced hyperproliferation ofcolon epithelial cells the
hyperproliferation was decreased byadded dietary
calcium, andinseveral animal models theoccurrence of
carcinogen-induced carcinomas ofthecolon decreased
with increased dietary calcium." "Decreased levels of
ornithine decarboxylase also were reported inhuman and
rodent colon mucosa exposed toincreasing levels of
calcium." "Inepidemiological studies, several investigators
reported inverse correlations between levels ofdietary
calcium intake andtheincidence ofcolon cancer. Extrapo-
lation ofthedata have suggested aprotective effect of
total calcium intakes above 1500 to1800 mg/day."
