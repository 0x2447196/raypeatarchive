FOR ANARGUMENT:
Environmental factors, including polyun-
saturated fats, exogenous estrogens, and heavy
metals, and nutritional deficiencies, create an
exaggerated estrogenic state, which synergizes
with other intermittent stresses. These external
stressors provoke therelease ofmany kinds of
stress mediating signal substances.
Aging isaprogressive inflammatory state, in
which there isanimbalance between excitatory
andrestorative processes, that progresses toward
ashock-like state.
The antistress hormone, cortisol, causes
tissue atrophy and cellular death intheprocess
ofresisting chronic stress.
Circulation and metabolism influence each
other, with inflammation and shock, hypoxic
metabolism and hypo perfusion promoting' each
other.
Inflammatory mediators damage mitochon-
drial respiration and cause cell swelling.
Swelling impairs circulation andcellfunction.
Inflammatory autoimmune diseases and
diabetes aremuch more common inwomen than
inmen. Insulin resistance appears atpuberty,
and diabetes ismore common ingirls than in
boys. Atmenopause, 50% ofwomen have
distinct insulin resistance. Insulin resistance and
the inflammatory autoimmune diseases are
clearly promoted byestrogen.
The chronic increase ofcortisol inresponse
tostress increases estrogen.
Changing metabolism, producing lactate
rather than carbon dioxide, changes thepHof
thecelland itswater content, allowing water-
soluble metals toenter mitochondria.
Diabetes, neuropathies, myopathies, schizo-
phrenias, the degenerative brain diseases,
congestive heart failure, multiple organ failure,
reduced l!lng function, insomnia, nocturnal
cramps, and many other disorders have similar
metabolic features, justifying similar therapies.Estrogen, calcium, heavy
metals, andnerve
degeneration.
Inthe1960s, someone noticed that acertain
crease ontheear-lobe was astrong indicator of
thetendency tohave aheart attack. Alittle later,
different researchers showed anassociation of
wrinkled skinwith smoking, andastrong associa-
tion between thepercentage ofpolyunsaturated
oilsinthediet andpremature wrinkling. Atthe
same time, people were demonstrating thatmany
factors contributed tothestiffening ofconnective
tissues, andtoageneralized "fibrosis." Intuitively,
everyone seems toknow thatthestate oftheskin
isanindicator ofgeneral vitality ordecrepitude.
But thehabit ofthinking interms ofspecific
diseases, rather than general processes, haskept
people from seeing that wrinkles, and other
connective tissue changes, aredeeply related to
themajor diseases ofaging.
The senile brain accumulates avariety of
mineral deposits, andtheargument hasbeen made
thatdietary aluminum isthecause ofAlzheimer's
disease. Itwould begood toeliminate added
aluminum from ourpublic water systems and
from ourfoods, butthere isgood evidence that
other processes arebehind theaccumulation of
aluminum andother minerals inourtissues.
With aging, minerals such ascalcium, iron,
aluminum, cadmium, lead, mercury, fluoride,
uranium, etc., accumulate inanimal tissues,
especially when those tissues aremetabolically
defective. Butasthesofttissues mineralize, the
bones andteeth demineralize. Inboth hard and
softtissues, mitochondria regulate mineralization.
Mercury hasbeen used medically foralong
time, andoneofthepopular uses formercurial
compounds hasbeen asadiuretic. Themercurial
diuretics suppress thekidneys' respiratory activity
andtheir ability toretain minerals, allowing fluids
topass through them relatively unconstrained.
This ledtotheunderstanding that themercury
acted byinterfering with thesulfhydryl groups
(mostly thecysteines inproteins) inkidney cells,
sowhen microscopic studies showed that the
mercurial diuretic caused calcification, beginning
inthemitochondria, this added toknowledge of
how mitochondria work, aswell astothegeneral
process ofsofttissue mineralization.
Hans Selye studied the process ofmetal-
induced calcification inrats. Inone group of
experiments, heshowed that anexcess ofiron
causes calcification ofareas ofskin thathave been
slightly injured, forexample byhaving thehair
plucked. Treatment oftherats with vitamin E
blocked the oxidative effects ofiron and
prevented calcification. Ordinary injuries, such as
bruises, sometimes calcify, presumably under the
influence ofhemoglobin and.iron.
Many toxins that oxidize thesulfhydryl (SH)
groups inmitochondria synergize with calcium
overload toproduce metabolic inactivation ofthe
mitochondria, usually accompanied byswelling.
For many years ithas been recognized that a
practically instantaneous effect ofestrogen isto
cause cells totake upwater. Itsnext step isto
stimulate the synthesis offats. Both ofthese
processes involve pervasive changes inthe
energetic processes ofthecells. Among thelater
changes produced byestrogen isincreased colla-
genproduction.
Ithas long been recognized that or
irritation islikely tolead tocalcification, through
thestages ofinflammation, edema, and fibrosis,
sometimes with fatty degeneration. These arethe
changes that ledpeople tothink ofradiation
damage asaform ofaccelerated aging. X-ray
treatment commonly causes calcification of
important organs such asthebrain andtheheart,
though skin calcification was among the first
radiation side-effects noticed. After 100years of
relative scientific inertia, there hasrecently been
some progress inunderstanding the common
processes behind "injury induced mineralization."
The biochemical arguments inthenext few
paragraphs simply outline some ofthefacts that2
have been omitted from themainstream discus-
sions ofbrain aging, estrogen, andmineralization.
When Ibegan studying thephysiology of
estrogen, Ifound that thebiochemical changes it
caused were thesame asthose ofaging, oxygen-
deprivation, andradiation injury.
Inmyexperiments, Ifound that both aging
and estrogen stimulation caused agreat increase
intheavailability ofreactive electrons, which I
measured bytheir reaction with adye. These
electrons come from aninteractive system that
involves theproteins (cysteine) and glutathione,
andthevarious cofactor-catalysts such asascorbic
acid and NADH (NAD isnicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide; thename reveals itsconnections to
the vitamin, niacin/nicotinamide, and tothe
"energy molecule," ATP, adenosine triphosphate,
butbiochemists areseldom concerned with those
links; theHindicates thereduced, electronically
energized form ofthemolecule).
Glutathione and other antioxidants tend to
prevent oxidative damage tothemitochondria's
sulfhydryl groups. Simply lowering thepH is
highly protective against oxidative attack by
metals, andthisispartly because theelectrons of
thesulfhydryl groups areless accessible tothe
oxidants inanacidic environment. Theformation
ofcarbon dioxide isthefundamental process for
keeping mitochondrial pHlow.
Glutathione depends onbeing regenerated by
thereducing molecule, NADH. When NADH is
consumed elsewhere atahigh rate, glutathione
itself becomes oxidized andunable toprotect the
mitochondria, andtheconsumption ofNADH (as
intheformation oflactic acid) tends toconsume
protons, raising thepH. Sotherate atwhich
NADH isconsumed canbecrucial inthelifeand
health ofacell. NAD issoclosely related tothe
availability ofATP thatthecelldeath system can
betriggered byadeficiency ofNAD (Catisti, et
al.,1999).
The cell's reductive system, centering on
NADH andNADPH (the extra P,phosphate, in
thismolecule allows ittoberegulated separately
from NAD), isclosely involved infatsynthesis.
Ifestrogen serves asaredox (reduction andoxida-
tion) link between NADH and NADP, fat
synthesis will beanadditional drain ontheavail-
ableNADH.
Inthe 1950s, several endocrinologists gathered
evidence toshow that estrogen canfunction asa
catalyst inthe oxidation and reduction ofthe
pyridine nucleotides, NADPH andNADH. Butin
the 1960s, thedoctrine thatestrogen's effects were
mediated exclusively bythe"estrogen receptor"
began replacing allother ideas about estrogen
chemistry andphysiology.
J.G.Liehr, andafew others, arestilldemon-
strating thatestrogen canfunction asacatalyst in
"redox cycling" (alternate reduction and
oxidation), which generates toxic free radicals,
andcanpotentially serve asadrain ontheNADH
systems. Infunctioning asaredox catalyst, estro-
genoscillates between anoxidized andareduced
molecular form. Inthis context, theratio ofthe
different forms ofestrogen takes onanentirely
different meaning than simply their different
effects ontheso-called estrogen receptors. Since
thedoctrine oftheestrogen receptor became a
medical preoccupation, most attention hasbeen
given toestradiol, since itisthe"strongest" estro-
gen insome tests, though estrone, theoxidized
form, isusually present intheblood inmuch
larger quantities. The quantity oftheoxidized
form ofestrogen isincreased incertain degenera-
tive conditions, such asuterine cancer, which isa
strong argument against the'idea that, asa"weaker
estrogen," itwould moderate the effect of
estradiol.
In my dissertation, Igave afew other
arguments regarding thewasteful consumption of
NADH. There isnow good evidence forthe
existence ofestrogen-stimulated extramitochon-
drial NADH oxidases, inaddition totheNADH
oxidase function ofage pigment, that Ihave
discussed inanearlier newsletter.
Until thelate 1970s, thefact that estrogen
causes increased absOIption ofcalcium was
offered asproof that itprevents osteoporosis, but
then itturned outthat theincreased retention of
calcium was occurring only inthe soft tissues,
where calcification isanormal trend with aging.
Infact, bone loss begins inawoman's twenties,3
andcontinues fairly steadily during theperiod in
which theactual level ofestrogen isrising.
Arteries and tendons tend tocalcify with
aging, thebrain and pineal gland, kidneys and
other organs retain more calcium and gradually
lose functions, and cells die with acalcium
overload.
Estrogen's stimulation ofiron absorption was
ignored bypeople who wanted toselliron pills
(often 18mgperday) towomen who lost iron
(maybe 5mgpermonth) bymenstruation. After
menopause, women absorb iron sofastthat their
body's iron load generally catches upwith men's
within afewyears, atwhich time their incidence
ofheart attacks becomes similar tomen's. Ifestro-
gen isamajor factor inthepromotion ofiron
absorption, women's accelerated iron retention
after menopause argues fortheexistence ofa
more estrogenic state than when they were
younger. Since progesterone falls sharply at
menopause, theeffect oftheunopposed estrogen
isgoing tobevery strong, even astheabsolute
quantities ofestrogen aredeclining.
When progesterone falls, the effects of
cortisol, aswell asestrogen, are increased,
because progesterone antagonizes both ofthose
hormones. Under theinfluence ofcortisol, fat
cells produce estrogen, andthiseffect isnormally
inhibited byprogesterone andthyroid.
Calcification ofsoft tissues and iron reten-
tion accelerate atmenopause. The body
accumulates calcium, butitisn't going into the
bones. The body accumulates iron, and ittoo
goes into thesoft tissues. Increased iron storage
intheliver isassociated with insulin resistance,
andincreased iron inanytissue isassociated with
increased lipid peroxidation instress.
Calcium and iron tend tobedeposited
together, and themitochondria areusually the
starting points fortheir deposition. Iron overload
has been implicated inheart disease, cancer,
diabetes, and many other degenerative diseases,
including thebrain diseases.
Estrogen, and thefree fatty acids that are
liberated under itsinfluence, increase theperme-
ability ofblood vessels, allowing water, proteins,
etc., toleak outinto thetissues. Tumor necrosis
factor, induced byestrogen, reduces the"blood
brain barrier" function, promoting brain inflam-
mation. The "blood brain barrier" means that
water soluble molecules areexcluded, while oil
soluble molecules enter freely. Highly charged
particles such asmetal ions are normally
efficiently excluded from thebrain, inproportion
totheir water-solubility ..
The free unsaturated fatty acids associated
with estrogen's influence cause brain edema and
mitochondrial damage (Catisti, etaI., 1999).
Although thefatty acids enter cells andmitochon-
dria easily because thecytoplasm and mitochon-
dria arelipophilic, unsaturation ofafatmakes ita
little less fatsoluble, and more water soluble.
Unsaturation also makes thefatmore likely tobe
oxidized into toxic products, and todamage the
mitochondria, suppressing itsrespiration, and
forcing thecell into theless efficient glycolytic
metabolism, raising thecell's pH,which makes the
celltake upmore water.
Allofthebiochemical features ofAlzheimer's
disease are consistent with prolonged estrogen
excess. Estrogen's toxicity tothedeveloping brain
was established inthe1950s and 1960s. Maybe
it'sakind ofprogress, thattheclaimed benefits of
estrogen have aged with the drug industry: in
1940 estrogen helped you getpregnant, in1950 it
helped you tomaintain pregnancy, in1960 it
helped toprevent orinterrupt pregnancy, in1970
ithelped you retain calcium and iron tobuild
strong bones and blood, in1960 and 1990 it
helped prevent heart attacks, andnow finally ithas
nothing lefttodobuttoprevent senile dementia.
The virologist, Gajdusek, wanted toargue that
hisvirus, andnottheaccumulation ofaluminum,
was responsible forkuru andother brain degenera-
tive diseases, and sohedidasurvey ofbrains of
demented people from regions with different types
ofsoil, andshowed that themost abundant metals
intheenvironment showed upinthebrains. He
argued that this showed that themetal deposition
wasjust theconsequence ofaviral disease, rather
than the cause ofthe brain degeneration. He
observed that the deposits consisted mainly of
calcium inregions that didn't have large amounts
ofother metals, soheargued that aparticular
metal such asaluminum couldn't beresponsible
forbrain degeneration. Buthedidn't consider that4
factors other than viruses might beresponsible for
thebrain mineralization thathesaw.
Although women have more osteoporosis and
more Alzheimer's disease than men do,thelack of
estrogen iscurrently blamed for both ofthe
problems. Why would Alzheimer's disease beso
different from the other predominantly female
diseases thathave been linked toexcess estrogen?
Why would women's brains bedifferent from
men's? Why would their nerve cells degenerate
without estrogen, while men's don't? Obviously
women's brains and nerves aren't very different
from men's and there simply isn't any sensible
reason tobelieve that "estrogen deficiency" is
responsit>le forAlzheimer's disease, orforosteo-
porosis, orforheart disease, oranyoftheother
problems that have been blamed on the
"menopausal estrogen deficiency."
The mass media find andpublicize thethings
they want tobelieve, orwant thepublic tobelieve.
"Coffee causes heart disease," "estrogen prevents
Alzheimer's disease," they say. How dothey make
the argument? Using plausible sounding terms
that hide the real situation isthe general
technique. Idon't want togive science reporters
disproportionate blame, because specious
argumentation ishabitually practiced bymany of
theprofessors and researchers who provide the
raw material forthenews reports. Inliterature,
"poetic diction" isintended toputthereader intoa
certain frame ofmind, tobereceptive tothepoet's
purpose. Many scientists rely onsomething like
"poetic diction."
For example, aSan Francisco study by
Kristine Yaffe and co-authors found that "free
estrogen," "the active form ofthehormone," was
higher inmore ofthe people who had better
cognitive function. Yaffe, etaI.,also found that
dementia isassociated with both depression and
osteoporosis.
There isn't really such athing as"free
estrogen," which isdefined interms ofaparticu-
larlaboratory situation that doesn't correspond to
anything inthebody. Estrogen isinsoluble in
water, unless there isalarge amount ofalcohol
present assolvent. When solids arepresent ina
solution, estrogen passes directly from one solid
toanother, according tothemomentary properties
ofthesolids. The laboratory measurement of"free
estrogen" isdescribing both aphysiological anda
physical fantasy.
"Protein bound estrogen" isanactive form of
estrogen, and the estrogen bound toalbumin
probably accounts formost ofestrogen's activity.
Free fatty acids, which compete with estrogen for
binding tothesteroid-binding globulin, probably
modify the properties ofthe more abundant
albumin sothatitbinds more estrogen initsactive
form, causing estrogen tomove from other
proteins, lipoproteins, andredblood cells onto the
activated albumin. The presence offats bound
tothe albumin makes the albumin more
lipophilic, fat-loving, and molecules are taken
upinto cells-especially brain cells--according
totheir solubility infats. For fatty molecules,
there isno"blood brain barrier." Thefactthat
albumin has variable lipophilicity makes itan
effective mechanism forthetransport anddelivery
ofoilsoluble molecules.
Yaffe, etaI.,inassociating depression and
osteoporosis with dementia, arearguing thatestro-
gendeficiency isthecause ofallthree conditions.
They offer some hypothetical mechanisms forhow
estrogen might prevent Alzheimer's disease.
Observing that brain cells die inpeople with
Alzheimer's disease, they mention that estrogen
stimulates "dendritic sprouting" inbrain cells, asif
that could compensate fortheloss ofcells (it
doesn't). They observe thatestrogen delivers more
tryptophan tothebrain, increasing theproduction
ofserotonin, and that itinhibits themonoamine
oxidases andother enzymes that inactivate trans-
mitter substances, increasing the activity of
adrenaline, serotonin, and other transmitter
substances. They suggest that increased circula-
tion caused byestrogen might protect thebrain.
Here, Yaffe, etaI.,have invoked the serotonin
myth and other myths, including the nitric
oxide myth, tosubstantiate theestrogen myth.
Serotonin doesn't "cure depression," andboth
serotonin andnitric oxide impair circulation and
aretoxic tobrain cells. Both ofthem poison
mitochondrial respiration. Estrogen increases the
viscosity ofblood, and impairs circulation and
oxygenation inmany other ways.5
The actual level ofestrogen rises allthrough
thereproductive years, and atmenopause, the
reduction inantiestrogenic factors, such as
progesterone, thyroid, and DHEA, leads to
increased effects ofestrogen. The increased
burden ofunsaturated fatty acids thataccumulate
with aging clearly promotes theeffects ofestrogen
andinterferes with theproduction oftheantiestro-
genic hormones. These unsaturated fats cause
progressive slowing ofthemetabolic rate, with
particularly sharp decreases around puberty and
menopause. Asthey interfere with theproduction
ofenergy, they tend toincrease cellular energy
requirements, bypromoting excitatory cellular
processes.
Estrogen andPUFAcreate insulin resistance,
and theresulting state of"diabetes" and stress
de-energizes tissues, with themitochondria that
aredamaged byunsaturated fatty acids, nitric
oxide, tumor necrosis factor (TNT), serotonin,
etc., failing tomeet thetissues' energy needs.
Stress, endotoxinemia, and increased estrogen
tend toactivate TNF, which hasarole inbrain
degenerative diseases andosteoporosis andmulti-
pleorgan failure. Much research hasfocussed on
asearch forasingle substance thatisresponsible
fortheinflammatory conditions ofAlzheimer's
disease, butinflammation andaging areprocesses
that involve many causes and mediators, with
each individual's history causing variations inthe
details. '
"Diabetes," ortheinability tooxidize glucose
vigorously, issimply adescription ofthe
metabolic aspect ofcellular degeneration. The
neurological impairment that issocommonly
associated with officially diagnosed diabetes is
simply oneaspect ofageneral cellular malfunc-
tion thatfollows from chronic energy deprivation.
Exactly thesame processes occur inthesudden
organ failure produced byshock, orthegradual
organ failures--lungs, liver, kidney, heart, thymus,
brain--that occur inaging. Ingeneral, there isa
failure of circulation that exacerbates the
metabolic andfunctional failures.
Diabetes, ofboth theinsulin dependent and
the non-insulin dependent types, iscommonly
associated with increased cortisol. Indiabetes,
inflammatory conditions, andunder theinfluence
ofincreased cortisol, brain cells aredeprived of
glucose.
Increased cortisol isanormal response tothe
cell-damaging effects ofstress orinflammation,
butcortisol itself causes thedeath ofnerve cells
and immune cells through excitotoxicity, by
blocking glucose metabolism. Estrogen increases
cortisol production inavariety ofways, acting
both through the pituitary and directly onthe
adrenal glands. Estrogen promotes excitotoxic
processes, byopposing progesterone and thyroid,
bydirectly exciting nerve cells, andbyincreasing
theactivity ofexcitatory nerve transmitters. It
also increases serotonin, which blocks energy
production byitseffect onmitochondria, aswell
asbyimpairing circulation ..
Atpuberty, there isasudden increase inthe
incidence ofdepression, especially ingirls.
Increased adrenaline, like increased cortisol, isa
feature ofdepression, stress, and inflammation;
mobilizing fats, itcan become part ofavicious
circle, inwhich free fatty acids cause insulin resis-
tance, activating the stress reactions. Increased
serotonin isafeature ofinflammation, shock,
stress, and depression, and, like histamine, istied
very closely toestrogen's effects.
Estrogen does have some ofthe effects
mention byYaffe, etaI.,butthese effects should
make aperson wonder whether estrogen isn't an
important factor in the development of
Alzheimer's disease, rather than being itsmain
preventive agent.
InAlzheimer's disease, there isadistinct
decrease inblood pressure, and orthostatic
hypotension isacommon feature ofdementia.
Estrogen's relaxing effect ontheblood vessels has
been shown toallow blood pooling intheveins,
producing orthostatic hypotension. Estrogen,
acting directly and through mediators such as
serotonin, decreases the heart's pumping
efficiency.
Blood viscosity isincreased inAlzheimer's
disease, and estrogen isknown toincrease blood
viscosity.
Nitric oxide, athird cultic substance along
with serotonin and estrogen, isinvoked asa
normalizer ofbrain circulation and protector of
nerve cells from peroxidation. Whether a6
substance isan antioxidant orpro-oxidant
depends onitsenvironment, andboth nitric oxide
and estrogen arepro-oxidants, promoters oflipid
peroxidation and other forms ofcell damage,
under avariety ofphysiological situations.
Ifauthors are criticizing awell known
doctrine, itisreasonable forthem toassume that
their readers know thearguments infavor ofthat
doctrine, and toconcentrate ontheir critical
points. ButYaffe, etaI.,arearguing infavor ofa
well known doctrine. They fail topresent the
actual research situation. For them toignore the
work ofpeople like Brawer, Desjardins, Schipper,
and Liehr, who have explored thecytotoxic and
ne!lrotoxic effects ofestrogen, amounts tosimple
propaganda. When such material ispublished in
themass media, such aslAMA, itseffect canbe
considered asequivalent tofraud, since these
media don't publicize alternative views.
While there hasbeen some publicity about a
recent study that found that treating Alzheimer's
patients with estrogen for 12 weeks didn't
improve their mood ormental ability, there has
been relative silence about allthe studies that
show actual deterioration ofmentality ormood in
association with increased estrogen.
Inoldmen, higher estrogen was found tobe
associated with lower mental ability (Barret-
Connor, etaI.,1999). Although estradiol isthe
most potent estrogen, estrone isthemain estrogen
inthecirculation interms ofitsquantity, and
women's mental performance was found tobe
lower when theestrone was higher (Yaffe, etaI.,
1998).
Antiendorphin, antiexcitotoxic, anticholiner-
gic, antiserotonergic, antiprostaglandin, and
antiglucocorticoid drugs have been used with
good effect invarious degenerative nervous
diseases, but allthe so-called "anti" drugs are
imprecise antagonists, andhave many side effects.
The natural antagonists and nutrients areusually
helpful. Protein, sodium, magnesium, carbon
dioxidefbicarbonate, progesterone, thyroid,
vitamins, etc., can becurative inmany brain
diseases, butareseldom tried because ofcultic
medical ideas about nutrition, hormone tests, and
thenature ofcells anddisease.
Tothe extent that unsaturated fats, heavy
metals, and estrogenic substances (such as
soybean products; tofu, forexample, was recently
implicated indementia) canbeavoided, theinter-
active processes ofcell damage canberetarded.
Natural restorative processes canmaintain tissue
integrity ifthedestructive processes areslowed.

Annu Rev Nutr 1997;17:37-50. Toxic and essen-
tialmetal interactions. Goyer RA. Cadmium, lead,
mercury, and aluminum aretoxic metals that may
interact metabolically with nutritionally essential
metals. Iron deficiency increases absorption of
cadmium, lead, and aluminum. Lead interacts with
calcium inthenervous system toimpair cognitive
development. Cadmium and aluminum interact with
calcium intheskeletal system toproduce osteodystro-
phies. Lead replaces zinc onheme enzymes and
cadmium replaces zinc onmetallothionein. Selenium
protects from mercury and methylmercury toxicity.
Aluminum interacts with calcium inbone andkidneys,
resulting inaluminum osteodystrophy. Calcium
deficiency along with lowdietary magnesium may
contribute toaluminum-induced degenerative
nervous disease.

accumulation inaging: modulation bydietary
restriction. Cook CI,YuBP. "Male Fischer 344rats
fedadlibitum ordietary restricted (maintained on
60% ofadlibitum food intake) were sacrificed at6,
12and24months ofage." "Tissue total iron content
was shown toincrease significantly with age in
animals fedadlibitum (AL). At24months, these
animals showed comparable iron content increases in
theliver and kidney, butwere significantly greater
than measurements found inbrain. This age-related
iron accumulation, however, was found tobe
markedly suppressed bydietary restriction (DR) inall
tissues. Similarly, LPO measurements increased inan
age-related, tissue-specific fashion. At24months of
age, measurements ofLPO inALrats brain and
liver exceeded measurements inkidney. Again, we
found DR tomarkedly suppress age-related LPO
inalltissues. Reported here areourfindings onthe
ability ofDR tomodulate iron status atthetissue
level. Consistent with the proposed anti-oxidative
mechanism ofDR, these findings further suggest that
themodulation oftissue total ironcontent isanimpor-
tantcomponent ofthatmechanism.
