Cholesterol in Context:    
Part I
I decided to write about cholesterol again
because the US government and most medicaldoctors continue to say absurd things about it.Individuals can protect themselves by refusing toswallow their toxic misinformation, but ourcommon environment is being degraded in manyways by the consequences of this massivedeception.
It’s useful to know something of the forces that
have gone into creating the cholesterol demon ofpopular culture, but the essential thing is to recoverthe main line of investigation of cholesterol’s rolein the development of life and consciousness.
Several people in the 1930s and ’40s showed
that hypothyroidism caused atherosclerosis, andthat thyroid supplementation corrected it. In peoplewhose thyroid gland was removed, their serumcholesterol increased as their rate of metabolismslowed, and when they were given desiccatedthyroid to normalize their metabolic rate, theirserum cholesterol was immediately correspond-ingly normalized. In the early 1930s, Broda Barnesshowed that heart disease developed in hypothy-roid people, not in people whose metabolism wasproperly maintained by the thyroid hormone.
 Later, many experimenters, building on older
observations, showed that the rising cholesterolhad a defensive function. For example, when theamount of cholesterol flowing into an ovarianartery was increased, the amount of progesteroneflowing out of an ovarian vein increased propor-tionally, as the raw material was converted to theproduct. A major function of the thyroid hormoneis the conversion of cholesterol into steroidhormones, including the “bile salts,” but that
function has to be considered in relation to struc-tural and energetic processes that are affected byboth thyroid and cholesterol.
According to an old edition of W.G. MacCal-
lum’s pathology textbook, “It has been shown thatcertain lipoid substances, especially cholesterine,can act as inhibiting or neutralizing agents towardsuch haemolytic poisons as saponin, cobra poison,etc., through forming with them an innocuouscompound. Hanes showed that the relativeimmunity of puppies from chloroform poisoningis due to the large amount of cholesterin esters intheir tissues. When artificially introduced into thetissues of adult animals a similar protection isconferred.”
One of the strangest things about
cholesterol research is that therehave been so few studies of thegeneral physical interactions ofcholesterol with proteins, in contrastto the obsessive study of its in vitro
interactions with fats.
Since then, numerous publications have
described cholesterol’s effect in protecting redblood cells from factors that would normallycause them to disintegrate. These protectiveeffects involve the intrinsic qualities of the cellsthemselves, not just as the “neutralizing” functionthat Hanes referred to.
In the 1930s, while it was being shown that
hypothyroidism caused serum cholesterol toincrease, and also increased the risk of dying fromRay Peat's Newsletter

Not for republication without written permission.infectious disease and of developing heart disease
or cancer, two investigators examined the relationof atherosclerosis to the blood’s cholesterolcontent, and found that there was no correlationbetween them, regardless of age (Landé andSperry, 1936). The development of the cholesterolculture, and its claims to the contrary, in thefollowing decades has been reviewed by UffeRavenskov and Malcolm Kendrick. 
The billions of dollars that have been spent to
promote sales of anticholesterol drugs and foodscan account for the public’s fear of cholesterol, butthere were deeper factors in the biomedical culturethat made it easy for many researchers to ignore ordeny the fact that cholesterol in the blood doesn’tcause hardening of the arteries.
In the 1960s, the “lipid bilayer cytoplasmic
membrane” was a craze, and the physical proper-ties of cholesterol and saturated fatty acids werepopularly used to explain everything in terms of“membrane fluidity.” (Between January, 1964 andthe present, PubMed lists more than 37,000 entriesfor “lipid bilayer.”)
Cholesterol is a waxy substance, with a melting
point (198.4 F, 148 C) far higher than that of eventhe saturated fatty acids, and the image of thesehard frozen substances affected the way manyseemingly intelligent researchers approached theirthinking about cholesterol’s functions in theorganism.
In in vitro  experiments with thin layers of oily
substances, saturated fats and sterols are lessmobile than polyunsaturated fats, and this simplefact has motivated thousands of people to explainproblems in every kind of organ and tissue interms of the accumulation of these “hard fats,” or adeficiency of the fluid polyunsaturated fats.
The actual physical stiffness of whole cells and
their surroundings is very important. For exampleexcitotoxicity (Fang, et al., 2014), and other formsof energy depletion can stiffen cells, and prolongedenergy depletion and inflammation lead to degen-erative changes—tissue calcification, fibrosis, andinvasive, disorganized cell movement, forexample. These stress related stiffenings of the cellsubstance and matrix have nothing directly to dowith the local quantity of cholesterol.
Hypothyroidism, leading to energy depletion
and increased stress hormones, causes increasedrigidity of various cells that have been examined,
including red blood cells and brain cells (Tacconi,et al., 1991). The stiffer cells are also more fragileand disintegrate more easily. The stiffness of redblood cells in hypothyroidism increases theviscosity of the whole blood, and changes in blood
proteins contribute to this.
The fact that hypothyroidism usually involves
an increase in cholesterol along with the increasedrigidity and viscosity often leads the “lipidbilayer” people to explain those changes as aresult of the increased absorption of cholesterol bythe red cells, reducing the “fluidity of themembrane.” The experiments that showed theprotective anti-hemolysis effect of cholesterolconflict with this, because stiffer red cells aremore fragile.
When the cholesterol content of red blood
cells is experimentally lowered, they becomemore rigid, and restoring the normal amount ofcholesterol restores their flexibility (Murphy,1962). The in vitro  behavior of simple mixtures of
cholesterol with fats simply doesn’t correspondwith the way cholesterol affects living cells.
One of the strangest things about cholesterol
research is that there have been so few studies ofthe general physical interactions of cholesterolwith proteins, in contrast to the obsessive study ofits in vitro  interactions with fats. In the body, the
adipose tissues with a high fat content maintain amuch lower cholesterol content than the muscletissues. This is partly because muscles producemore cholesterol than fat tissue does, but alsobecause the structural proteins of cells have a highaffinity for cholesterol. In effect, fat and proteinsare mutually soluble.
I think it’s correct to think of protoplasm as a
complex kind of solution of proteins, water,cholesterol and other lipids, nucleic acids, ATP,and smaller amounts of other substances, with aviscosity that varies as small changes of solutesmodify the balance of cohesive forces. Because ofits molecular shape and hydrophobicity, choles-terol acts as both a lubricant and a stabilizer ofthis complex system. It decreases cell rigidity byincreasing protein mobility (Ayee and Levitan,2016). 
In bacteria and fungi and plants, stability is
more important than flexibility. Like the thyroid2hormone, cholesterol is uniquely associated with
animals; plants and fungi use slightly differentsterols. Its resistance to oxidative damage allowstissues to function safely at relatively high bodytemperature in the presence of intense oxidativereactions, as in the brain. The red blood cell’smechanical stability and flexibility are essential foreffectively fulfilling its various functions in circu-lation, allowing it to pass undamaged throughnarrow capillaries, and it has also served as auseful model for understanding these physicalproperties in cells of other types, including nervecells, muscle cells (Hissa, et al., 2013, 2017), whiteblood cells (Saha, et al., 2017), endothelial cells(Byfeld, et al, 2004), kidney cells (Khatibzadeh, etal., 2012), lens cells (Borchman and Yappert,2010)  and cancer cells (Morachevskaya, et al.,2007).
 Many “authoritative sources” describe choles-
terol as the precursor to bile acids and steroidhormones, and also as a component of a cellmembrane which serves in place of plants’ rigidcell wall. This membrane, for more than 50 years,has been described as a semi-permeable lipidbilayer, reinforced by cholesterol, interrupted hereand there by protein pores, channels, pumps,receptors, and various attachment sites. This “cell-wall-equivalent” is often said to have tensilestrength, as well as a chemical barrier function,that keeps a cell from losing its “plasma” which isenclosed and retained by the membrane.
When a drop of water is on an oily surface it
doesn’t spread, because of its strong cohesiveforces, and the oil’s lack of those forces. When adrop of oil falls onto water, it spreads, becomingextremely thin. Benjamin Franklin estimated that ateaspoonful of olive oil spread over about half anacre of a pond. Oil has very weak cohesive forces,and effectively no tensile strength.
The fact that cholesterol strengthens cells,
keeping them from disintegrating under stress,obviously has nothing to do with a lipid bilayermembrane. That membrane doctrine has made itseem paradoxical that the loss of cholesterolshould make cells stiffer, while weakening them.Gilbert Ling has, for 65 years, pointed out thenumerous “paradoxes” confronted by theadvocates of the lipid boundary membrane, but themembrane doctrine continues to govern mostbiomedical thinking, including theories of choles-
terol’s role in the diseases of aging.
About 40 years ago, someone noticed that the
commercial cholesterol used for research wascontaminated by oxidation, and that pure choles-terol didn’t produce the same toxic effects. Lipidperoxidation was observed in atheroscleroticplaques, and the breakdown products of polyun-saturated fats such as hydroxynonenal, malondial-dehyde, and acrolein (from EPA, arachidonic acid,and other highly unsaturated fats in the affectedblood vessel are known to attract white blood cellssuch as macrophages, which accumulate in theplaques.
The age pigment, ceroid or lipofuscin, that’s
derived largely from PUFA and associated withthe macrophage “foam cells” in the plaque,accumulates iron (Lee, et al., 1998), and bycatalyzing oxidation, creates local hypoxia,leading to lactic acid production, contributing toan inflammatory process.  The products of lipidperoxidation, such as azelaic acid (Riad, et al.,2018), along with lactate, lead to the calcificationof tissue.  
Several observers have demonstrated that a
protein that can remove excess cholesterol andother lipids from arteries, ABCA1 (ATP-bindingcassette transporter or CERP (cholesterol effluxregulatory protein), is degraded by polyunsatu-rated fatty acids. “These findings raise the possi-bility that an increased supply of unsaturated fattyacids in the artery wall promotes atherogenesis byimpairing the ABCA1 cholesterol secretorypathway in macrophages” (Wang and Oram, 2002,2005).
Paul Cullen, et al. (1997, 2005) found that the
foam cells found in atherosclerosis plaquescontain “. . . cholesterol esters, principally choles-teryl eicosapentaenoate, cholesteryl docosahexae-noate, cholesteryl arachidonate, cholesteryl linole-ate and cholesteryl oleat e.”  The oxidation of these
fatty acids produces acrolein and relatedcompounds which block the ability of cells toregulate cholesterol (Shao, et al., 2005).
Combined with the unstable polyunsatu-
rated fats, cholesterol can’t perform its normalfunctions. The unstable polyunsaturated fatsinactivate the corrective (ABCA) protein thatremoves the damaged form of cholesterol from3cells, while they activate the enzyme (ACAT)
that forms that toxic form of cholesterol(Johnson, et al., 1983).
Several pharmaceutical companies have recog-
nized that a drug to inhibit the enzyme that formscholesterol esters would be profitable, but trials inwhich the experimental drug increased heartdisease have dampened their interest. It hasalready been established that progesterone inhibitsACAT in a variety of tissues (Miller and Melnyk-ovych, 1984; Batetta, et al ., 2001), probably as part
of its positive feedback effect on its own produc-tion, increasing the amount of its own precursor (“… regulation of the ACAT reaction may signifi-cantly modulate rates of progesteronebiosynthesis.” Veldhuis, et al., 1985). It’s signifi-cant that progesterone has the opposite effect onthis enzyme in the liver (“… progesterone aloneincreases the hepatic ACAT activity, but given incombination with estrogen progesterone does nothave the same effect on hepatic ACAT activity,”Miller and Melnykovych, 1984), since the liver’sability to secrete cholesterol is essential for makingcholesterol available to steroid-forming tissues,such as the ovary and adrenal glands.Progesterone, which has many functions thatprotect against PUFA, also increases a relatedregulatory protein, ABCA2, that regulates choles-terol and is highly expressed in the brain (Davis, etal., 2004).  
The healthy young brain contains a very large
amount of cholesterol, almost all in the pure,non-esterified or “free” form—more than 99.5%,according to Orth and Be llosta (2012, citing Björk-
hem and Meaney, 2004). The aging, degeneratingbrain contains an increasing amount of esterifiedcholesterol, and some experiments show thatinhibition of ACAT, preventing that accumulation,is protective (Bryleva, et al., 2010;). The localanesthetics lidocaine, benzocaine, tetracaine, anddibucaine inhibit this enzyme (Bell, et al., 1982).
In the 1960s, the famous “heart protective
diet,” based on a belief that PUFA were bothessential and beneficial, was tested on a group of846 veterans. The diet of half of the men containedcorn oil rather than other fats, while the otherswere given a more typical diet with what theycalled “saturated” fats, which weren’t verysaturated. The number of double bonds, the degreeof unsaturation, in a fat can be measured by the
amount of iodine they bind. The fats in the controldiet had an iodine number of 55; butter’s iodinenumber is less than 40, coconut oil’s less than 10.The control group contained fewer non-smokers,and more heavy smokers. After 8 years, thenumber of fatal heart attacks was the same in bothgroups, but there were seven deaths from cancerin the experimental group, and only two in thecontrol group. While there is still great reluctanceto acknowledge the carcinogenic nature of PUFA,results such as this have motivated the drug indus-try to consider using their ACAT inhibitors(blocking the attachment of PUFA to cholesterol)for treating cancer.
The polyunsaturated fatty acids, by being
combined with the normally protectivecholesterol, convert it into a sort of toxin, a disor-ganizing factor, leading to neurodegeneration,hardening of the arteries, cataracts, chronic kidneydisease, and cancer.
When the diet lacks the polyunsaturated fatty
acids, the liver synthesizes saturated fatty acids,and exports its cholesterol mainly in combinationwith palmitate, which doesn’t promote lipidperoxidation, or in the non-esterified “free” form.A lifetime of accumulating PUFA progressivelydegrades the liver’s protective functions, but thosefunctions can gradually be restored by providingcarbohydrates and saturated fats without thepolyunsaturated fats, along with some of thefactors that have been depleted along with freecholesterol, especially pregnenolone andprogesterone.
In the next newsletter, I intend to talk about a
line of thinking about cholesterol that has beensubmerged by the food and drug industries andtheir accomplices in government.
