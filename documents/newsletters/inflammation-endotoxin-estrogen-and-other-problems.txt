Inflammation, endotoxin,
estrogen, and other problems
Over the last few decades, themeaning of
inflammation has changed alittle, from being
thought ofsimply asanessential part ofthe
immune reaction, to being recognized as
something that can interfere with the immune
system, andthatcontributes tochronic disease and
degeneration.
Many components of the inflammatory
reaction have been identified lately, buttheway
those fitinto thecontext ofthewhole organism
stillisn't clear.
Many ofthe"evolutionary interpretations" of
particular biological features arejustwords, empty
speculations that can't betested. (Selective breed-
ingexperiments and comparative physiology can
provide some basis forarguments about theevolu-
tion oftheimmune system, butthepeople who
created the "big picture" weren't burdened bya
need fordetailed evidence.)
Developmental processes, however, have been
studied ingreat detail, andasinformation accumu-
lates, itisbecoming clear thatthetraditional view
ofinflammation haslittle todowith reality. When
inflammation is"explained" assomething that
evolved toprotect theorganism against infection,
people will betaught that theory, andwill feelno
need tothink about thesubject again.
With thenewer realization that inflanunation
canlead tocancer, heart disease, diabetes, demen-
tia,and other degenerative processes, thelogical
seeming course ofaction forpeople taught the
traditional "evolutionary" view ofinflammation
has been tolook forthe infectious organism
causing theproblem.Butifweputinflammation into thedevelop-
mental context, itisimmediately clear thatinfec-
tious agents arejust oneofthemany factors that
weinteract with and that canbeinvolved inthe
inflanunatory and degenerative processes. Nutri-
tion, toxins, environmental stresses, and biologi-
calcycles influence theway wereact toinfectious
organisms, and even intheabsence ofvirulent
organisms, cancause inflanunation anddegenera-
tion. Intheuterus andovary, forexample, inflam-
matory and degenerative changes are part of
normal functioning.
Inthose organs, thecyclic changes instructure
areorchestrated toamonthly rhythm thatmakes
them very obvious. But inother organs, such as
theadrenal c.ortex, theintestinal epithelium, the
liver, andtheskin, there isacontinuous process
ofrenewal (and degeneration) ofcells that isfairly
well known, despite thedogmatists who want to
cling tothe "Hayflick limit," that denies the
existence ofaflowing renewal ofcells inevery
organ, orthat insists that norenewal ispossible
after 50divisions ofacell line. Cell renewal
occurs even inthe brain and the heart. The
Hayflick doctrine was plausible topeople who
were committed toaWeismannist view ofgenet-
icsanddevelopment, aview that radically denied
theroleoforganismic andenvironmental interac-
tions indevelopment.
Cells that arewell insulated from theenviron-
ment canlive foravery long time, butcells that
directly contact theenvironment, i.e.,theskin and
theintestinal epithelium, divide rapidly, andare
shed.
When stimulation isgreat, andenergy supply
isweak, acellwill either adapt totheconditions,
sometimes increasing itsrate ofdivision, ordie.
Nerve cells canprotect themselves bybecoming
insensitive tostimulation; insome cases, the
stress-induced lossofitsaxon canprobably turn a
nerve cellintoaresting, orstem, cell.
The dissolution ofacellreleases itsmaterials
indifferent ways, according totheconditions that
caused ittodie. Sometimes itreleases histamine
andother substances that canincrease blood flow
innearby capillaries, butunder other conditions it
can liquefy without causing much change inits
environment. When asignificant amount ofcellu-
lardebris accumulates inanarea, wandering cells
sense it,anddepending onthenature oftheinjury,
they may simply remove thedebris, orstay and
adapt, forming partofarepair structure.
Proteolytic enzymes andnucleases candecom-
pose most ofthestructural proteins and nucleic
acids, butthelipases that actonthedead cell's
structural lipids release avariety ofmodified
phospholipids, fatty acids, and cholesterol, with
considerable biological activity orsignificance.
These substances appear with regularity when
cells arebeing damaged, and they arethemost
important class ofsignals acting ontheimmune
system. Oxidized phospholipids can cause other
cells toform avariety ofsubstances that amplifY
thealarm signal (e.g., Kadl, etaI.,2002). Their
importance justifies theview ofJ.Cunliffe andP.
Matzinger, that theimmune system isactually a
system of structural development and
maintenance, and that itsrole inkilling alien
organisms istriggered when tissue damage
releases ourintrinsic signal substances.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids, derived from
foods, have aspecial role intheimmune system,
intensifYing the effects ofstress (cholesterol
newsletter, September, 2005) inkilling lympho-
cytes, ,and blocking theproliferative response of
thymic cells (Rotondo, etaI.,1994). They tend to
shift immune functions from cellular immunity to
humoral (antibody) immunity, and this pattern
predisposes toautoimmunity. They areprobably
directly toxic totheliver (Ritskes-Hoitinga, 1998).
DHA increases theleakiness ofthebowel, allow-
ingmore endotoxin toenter thecirculation (Roig-
Perez, etaI.,2004).
When cells have enough glucose, oxygen, and
thyroid hormone, andaren't being over-stimulated,
energy consumption can beuncoupled from the
formation ofATP. This allows themitochondria2
todevote more energy totheproduction ofthe
material needed forsynthesizing cholesterol and
itsderivatives, pregnenolone, progesterone, and
DHEA, andtoform carbon dioxide atahigh rate.
Uncoupling helps tolower the formation of
inflammatory cytokines (Horvath, etal.,2003). A
chronically "uncoupled" metabolic state hasbeen
associated with longevity (Speakman, etal.,
2004). The rateofcholesterol production, andthe
amount incirculation, tend tobeinversely related
tosystemic inflammation. Allofthe types of
lipoprotein absorb, bind, and help toeliminate
endotoxin, forexample. Carbon dioxide andthe
major steroids stabilize cells against excessive
stimulation, andprotect thecellstructure.
Bacteria andplants produce avariety oflipids
thatserve some purposes analogous toourcholes-
terol and phospholipids. Some ofthecommon
intestinal bacteria produce amolecule containing
amino sugars andfatty acids (lipopolysaccharide,
LPS), that's called endotoxin. The "endo" root
distinguishes itfrom the"exotoxins" secreted by
some bacteria, because theendotoxin isastruc-
tural partofthebacterium, thatprotects thebacte-
rium against some oftheexotoxins produced by
other microorganisms. Normally, ourintestine and
liver destroy most oftheLPS endotoxin before it
reaches thegeneral circulation. The bile acids, a
major endproduct ofcholesterol, have adetergent
action inthe intestine that usually keeps
endotoxin insolution, away from theabsorptive
surfaces oftheintestine. If theflow ofbile is
obstructed, endotoxin isallowed toenter the
system (Bertok, 2004). Estrogen can il"..hibit the
flow ofbile(Stieger, etaI.,2000). Amucus lining
ispart oftheprotective barrier, butthemicro-
scopic integrity oftheintestinal cells themselves
finally regulates thepassage ofmaterials into the
blood andlymphatic vessels.
The barrier function ofthe intestine is
weakened bypoisons, malnutrition, and the
reduced circulation that can result from stress.
Estrogens, such as oral contraceptives or
Premarin, can cause colitis byshutting offthe
blood supply (Gurbuz, etaI.,1994; Deana and
Dean, 1995).
When our cells areexposed toLPS, they
produce many ofthesame reactions that they
would produce inresponse toour endogenous
phospholipids. The major proteins that interact
with cholesterol contain lipophilic regions called
beta sheets, inwhich arelatively flat surface is
formed byparallel strands oftheprotein. LPS
contains agroup offatty acids bound together by
thepolysaccharide, that strongly binds tothese
proteins.
The alarm reaction produced either bydamage
ofsome ofourown tissue orbytheentrance of
LPS into thecirculation can, under ideal circum-
stances, lead toaseries ofprotective and defen-
sive reactions, that resolve the problem. The
production ofsteroids isincreased, and, early in
life, theliberation offatty acids itself cancontrib-
utetotheantiinflammatory processes that restore
thebarrier function and energy production. But
when theendogenous omega-9 fatty acids have
been thorougWy displaced bydietary omega-6 and
omega.-3 fatty acids, thesystemic release offatty
acids becomes anamplifier ofthestress state initi-
ated byinjury orother stress. The liver, for
example, decreases itsdetoxification ofestrogen
inthepresence ofpolyunsaturated fatty acids.
Intheovary anduterus, thehealthy alternation
ofexcitation andquiescence usually continues for
many years, and inrodents itoften ends inastate
of"persistent estrus," inwhich theexcitatory state
can't betelminated inthe usual way, bythe
production of progesterone. In humans,
menopause isanalogous, because theexcitatory
FSH hormone from thepituitary becomes exces-
sive, with theovary continuing toproduce estro-
gen but failing to produce progesterone,
sometimes with thepituitary failing toshift from
FSH toLH. Inrodents, it'srecognized that persis-
tent estrus iscaused bychronically elevated estro-
gen, butinhumans there has been tremendous
resistance totherecognition ofestrogen's central
role inmenopause and senescence. Anexcess of
the basic promoter ofinflammation, serotonin,
which isclosely associated with estrogen's influ-
ence, canhave similar effects onthereproductive
cycle (Cooper, et a!., 1986). The industry has
devoted the necessary funding tomaking the
easily manipulated medical culture, and the
public, believe theopposite, i.e., that reproductive
aging ismainly caused byestrogen deficiency.3
The liver, besides itsimportant role inkeeping
endotoxin from reaching thecirculation, normally
"destroys" alloftheestrogen that reaches it,that
is,itmakes itwater soluble sothat itwill be
excreted intheurine orbile, rather than being
retained bycells. But inmalnutrition, hypothy-
roidism, orstress, theliver allows estrogen topass
through without being completely inactivated.
M.S. Biskind and G.R. Biskind (1941, 1946)
showed that theBvitamins were crucial forestro-
genelimination, andothers around thesame time
demonstrated that toxins, protein deficiency,
hypothyroidism, andeven hyperestrogenism itself
tended toreduce theliver's ability todetoxify
estrogen. Endotoxin's inhibition ofthis detoxify-
ingsystem (Banhegyi, etaI.,1995) isjust oneof
theways thatitincreases estrogen systemically.
Estrogen, which was named foragadfly, is
excitatory inallofitsbiological actions (including
nervous excitation andcellular proliferation), and
inmost tissues this excitatory action has been
shown tocause oxidation damage. Many different
toxic changes have been produced intheliver by
estrogen, but lipid peroxidation can beclearly
demonstrated intheliver asanearly reaction to
subcutaneous estrogen injection (Gene, eta!.,
1999).
Endotoxin andestrogen interact inmany inter-
esting and potentially deadly ways. Both ofthem
activate many ofthesame alarm systems, includ-
ingphospholipases, nitric oxide synthase, tumor
necrosis factor (TNF), interleukins (including
IL-6, according toBengtsson, etaI.,2004), and
the enzymes that form prostaglandins from
polyunsaturated fatty acids. Estrogen makes the
toxic-mediator-producing cells in the liver
(Kupffer cells) hypersensitive toLPS--15 times
more sensitive than normal (Ikejima, eta!.,1998).
One way estrogen increases the toxicity of
endotoxin isprobably bymaking the intestine
more permeable (Enomoto, eta!., 1999). The
acute phase reaction, aprocess inwhich theliver
decreases itsproduction ofalbumin andincreases
theproduction ofserum amyloids, lipoproteins,
and fibrinogen, ispromoted byboth estrogen and
endotoxin. Estrogen (like endotoxin) activates
nuclear factor kappa-B (Shyamala and Guiot,
1992; Hamilton, eta!.,2003), which activates
cells toproduce TNF, nitric oxide, prostaglandins,
and interleukins. Along series ofobservations
have indicated that estrogen's main effects begin
with redox changes inthe mitochondria, and
recent evidence (Felty andRoy, 2005) shows that
oxidative free radicals produced inthemitochon-
dria byestrogen induce NFkappa-B. Oldageis
associated with increased activity ofNF kappa-B.
Aspirin, increased levels ofcarbon dioxide (Ni
Chonghaile, etaI.,2005), andprogesterone (Deroo
andArcher, 2002; Kelly, eta!.,2001; Allport, et
a!.,2001; vanderBurg and van derSaag, 1996;
Caldenhoven, etaI.,1995) inhibit NFkappa-B,
and NFkappa-B inhibits thesynthesis ofboth
testosterone (Hong, etaI.,2004) andprogesterone
(Allport, etaI.,2001).
The amount ofinjury needed toincrease the
endotoxin intheblood canbefairly minor. Two
thirds ofpeople having acolonoscopy had a
significant increase inendotoxin intheir blood,
and intense exercise oranxiety will increase it.
Endotoxin activates theenzyme that synthesizes
estrogen while itdecreases the formation of
androgen (Christeff, etaI., 1992), and this
undoubtedly ispartly responsible forthelarge
increases inestrogen inboth men and women
caused bytrauma, sickness orexcessive fatigue.
The positive interactions among estrogen and
endoto'xin and NF kappa-B, and their negative
interactions with progesterone and testosterone,
tend to"stabilize" theinflammatory condition. In
ayoung person, good food, sunlight, andahigh
altitude canoften overcome severe and progres-
sive irtflammatory conditions. Inanolder person,
whose tissues contain larger amounts ofpolyun-
saturated fats and their breakdown products, it
takes more environmental support togetoutofthe
inflammatory pattern.
Glycine (themain amino acid ingelatin) isan
important nutrient with powerful antiinflanunatory
actions (Zhong, eta!.,1999; Wang, eta!.,2004).
Saturated fatty acids can help toreduce chronic
inflanunatory states, butit'sessential toeliminate
asfaraspossible theunstable polyunsaturated
fatty acids, which suppress normal immune
functions, besides contributing tothefree radical-
lipid peroxidation burden. Cholesterol and ATP
have been used therapeutically, butordinarily their4
synthesis canbeincreased safely byusing adiet
that contains asignificant amount ofordinary
sugar (sucrose, from fruits) when the thyroid
function isadequate.
Since vascular leakiness isinvolved inthe
inflanunatory syndromes, aswell asinshock, I
think it'sreasonable totreat them similarly,
keeping inmind theimportance ofnormal blood
volume andviscosity. Sodium andsugar help to
lower adrenaline, andsothey canmake acontri-
bution topreventing high blood pressure, while
maintaining normal hydration oftheblood. Estra-
diolandcholera toxin, which both increase vascu-
lar leakiness, probably exert some oftheir
influence bylowering theosmotic tension ofthe
extracellular fluid (Webster, etaI.,1984; Witten
and Bradbury, 1951). The enzyme activated by
cholera toxin, estrogen, andhypotonic medium in
thestudy byWebster, etaI.,was ornithine decar-
boxylase, which produces thepolyamines. The
polyamines promote cellular proliferation, and
promote the actions ofthe excitotoxic amino
acids. Histamine also activates excitotoxicity, and
magnesium opposes it.
The inflammatory states that produce the
age-related degenerative diseases have many
things incommon with "pre-eclampsia" or
pregnancy toxemia, and thesame simple things
canusually alleviate both kinds ofproblem. With
aging, intracellular water tends todecrease, asthe
extracellular water increases (Lesser and
Markovsky, 1979), probably because ofreduced
cellular energy, andincreased vascular permeabil-
ity. When albumin production isadequate, it
"binds" sodium, andthecombination osmotically
increases theability oftheblood toretain water.
Sodium bicarbonate canprovide alittle extra
carbon dioxide, along with thesodium, and its
diuretic action iswell established, butitworks by
improving perfusion ofthetissues, reducing any
abnormal water retention, rather than bycausing
thekidneys tolose water inunphysiological ways.
One ofprogesterone's important functions isthe
maintenance ofblood volume, and adequate
thyroid isessential forpreventing hyponatremia
(insufficient sodium intheblood, which often
occurs incombination with decreased formation
ofalbumin).
Stress, trauma, and shock start aninflamma-
tory process, thatcancause progressive damage to
theorgans, including theliver. Giving progester-
one following the injury protects against the
increase ofTNF, IL-6, and leakage ofliver
enzymes (Kuebler, etal.,2003). It has similar
protective effects inthebrain, lungs, and other
organs. During thenormal menstrual cycle, IL-6 is
inversely related tothe level ofprogesterone
(Angstwum1, etaI.,1997).
The liver's important role inregulating
endotoxin and estrogen, and the cascade of
inflammatory mediators that canbereleased asa
result ofadepression ofthe liver's function,
makes itimportant tokeep theliver inmind, even
when theimmediate problem seems tobeinthe
brain, thelungs, kidneys, pancreas, blood vessels,
heart, prostate, ovaries, muscles, oranyother
organ.
Estrogen isobviously partofaprimitive repair
system, more fundamental orgeneral than itsrole
inreproduction. When atissue isinjured, itforms
large amounts ofanenzyme, beta-glucuronidase,
that removes thewater soluble sugar acid, glucu-
ronic acid, from theestrogen glucuronide which
circulates harmlessly intheblood after itsforma-
tion intheliver, and before itselimination inthe
urine. The injured tissue reverses theinactivation
oftheestrogen that has OCCUlTed intheliver,
causing thefatsoluble estrogen toremain inthe
damaged tissue, where itchanges themetabolism,
activating enzymes thatstimulate proliferation and
accelerate collagen formation andother processes
involved inrepair. (Other enzymes, sulfatases and
aromatase, contribute totheincrease inestrogen in
stressed tissues, butbeta-glucuronidase hasbeen
studied most, because itisvery easy toidentify.)
These local processes don't depend onliver
failure tobecome active, but inthe systemic
effects ofliver failure they probably play avery
important role inamplifying the effects of
endotqxin andunprocessed estrogen.
The effects ofendotoxin andestrogen oncells
are additive, forexample incausing vascular
leakiness (e.g., Tollan, etal.,1992), even inthe
brain (Oztas andKaya, 1998). Dementia, respira-
tory distress/shock lung, and alloftheclassical
inflammatory conditions, are promoted bythe5
simple process ofmaking capillaries excessively
permeable. But thecellular changes that make
capillaries leaky, also affect other cells, changing
their antigenicity, leading to"autoimmune"
processes (Sekigawa, etaI.,2004).
Protein deficiency creates aninflammatory
state, andsince stress causes tissue proteins tobe
destroyed andconverted into sugars andfats, it's
common tounderestimate theamount ofprotein
needed. Oneofthefunctions ofsucrose inthediet
istoreduce theproduction ofcortisol, andsoto
spare protein.
Milk has avariety ofantiinflammatory
functions. Itssaturated fatshelp toprevent oxida-
tionoflipids, including cholesterol. Several ofits
vitamins, especially vitamins Dand K,have
antiinflammatory andeven antiestrogenic actions.
Since theparathyroid hormone (like some ofthe
other pituitary hormones) ispro-inflal11matory, a
generous supply ofcalcium isimportant because
itinhibits the secretion ofthe parathyroid
hormone.
Stress activates theendorphin system (partly
byincreased histamine, according toKjaer, etaI.,
1993), and these intrinsic hormones, like
morphine and the other opiates, are
pro-inflammatory. Both estrogen and endotoxin
activate the endorphin system. Excessive
exposure toestrogen destroys many ofthebeta-
endorphin nerves inthehypothalamus, resulting
inanadaptive hypersensitivity, that maintains a
chronic activation ofthe endorphin sensitive
tissues, suppressing progesterone production
(Desjardins, 1995).
There aredrugs (e.g., naloxone) that canhelp
toblock theactions oftheendorphins, andsince
theendorphins inhibit theluteinizing hormone
(LH) which promotes theproduction ofprogester-
one and testosterone, alittle naloxone canoften
restore nonnal menstrual cycles thathave stopped
because ofstress andexcessive exposure toestro-
gen. Endorphins are probably involved in
menopausal flushing, and drugs ofthenaloxone
type have been used torelieve it.Butacombina-
tionofother antistress factors candothesame.
Salicylic acid, which occurs naturally inmany
fruits, aswell asinaspirin, isunlike theother
antiinflal11matory drugs sovaguely classified with
itas"nonsteroidal," inhaving abroad spectrum of
antiinflammatory effects, inhibiting theprosta-
glandins andNFkappa-B, TNF, andIL-6, besides
contributing totheinhibition ofestrogen synthesis
andactions.
Magnesium islostduring stress, andthatcan
lead todestabilization ofthemast cells, with
increased release ofhistamine andother promoters
ofinflammation andexcitation. Thyroid hormone
helps cells toassimilate and retain magnesium.
Estrogen's effect onmagnesium seems tobe
antagonistic (e.g., Muneyyirci-Delale, etal.,
1999). Fruits and meats are good sources of
magnesium, butcoffee and chocolate areamong
thebest sources ofit,andthecaffeine they contain
adds totheir antiinflammatory andliver-protective
effect (seeSakamoto, etal.,1999).
The saturated fatty acids found incoconut oil
inhibit theformation ofhistamine (Mimura, etal.,
1980), asdoes glucose (Kaneko, etal.,1997), and
prevent leakiness oftheintestine, protecting the
liver from endotoxin (Kono, etal.,2003). Proges-
terone andtestosterone protect against histamine,
while estrogen increases itsformation andactions.
Benadryl (diphenhydran1ine) protects theliver and
other organs from various toxins, and from the
toxic effects ofhistamine.
Thyroid's antiinflammatory function inarthri-
tisandrheumatic conditions hasbeen known for
about acentury, butthere aren't many contempo-
rary publications onitsroles ininflammation and
degeneration (see Bartalena, etal.,1994; Ritten-
house andRedei, 1997).
TSH, thethyroid stimulating hormone secreted
bythepituitary, stimulates some oftheinflamma-
tory mediators, andalthough thedefinition ofthe
"normal range" hasbeen decreasing, thepeople I
seewhose TSH is"normal" aren't ashealthy as
those whose TSH iswell "below normal." Other
indicators ofadequate thyroid function areneeded.
Expired carbon dioxide ("end tidal") isagood
indicator, but it'srarely measured. Lactic acid
tends toriseinhypothyroidism, someasuring its
level inthe blood can behelpful. Oxygen
consumption, serum cholesterol, daily cycle of
temperature andpulse rate, andcalorie consump-
tion aregood indicators ofthyroid function. The6
inflammatory cytokines canactivate theglycolytic
enzymes that produce lactic acid (Bauer, etal.,
2004), and thethyroid hormone accelerates the
oxidation oflactic acid, soIthink it'sreasonable
tothink ofahigher metabolic rateasacOlTective
compensation forinflammation, aswell \asthe
most important factor inpreventing it.
Anyone canmeasure their calorie consump-
tion with enough accuracy tobeuseful. Consider-
ing that the Criles' measurements ofoxygen
consumption inthe1930s showed thatAn1ericans
asagroup were extremely hypothyroid, andthat
other studies done around the same time
suggested that nearly half ofthe population
benefitted from supplemental thyroid, weshould
probably ignore thepresent "official" recommen-
dations regarding caloric require- ments.
Besides keeping track ofthecaloric value of
thefood weeat, it'spossible toestimate our
metabolic rate fairly closely bymeasuring our
daily fluid intake, andsubtracting theamount of
urine produced during 24hours. The missing
water was evaporated, andwith moderate atmos-
pheric humidity, weevaporate about aliter of
water forevery 1000 calories webum.
One oftheroles offatinthefood istostimu-
late thesecretion ofbile bythegall bladder.
Besides that important function, saturated fats
have avariety ofprotective, antiinflammatory
effects, including thereduction ofendotoxemia
and lipid peroxidation (Nanji, etal., 1997).
"Coconut oilcompletely abolished theresponses
toendotoxin" (Wan andGrimble, 1987).
Appetizing foods stimulate the digestive
secretions, butit'simportant toavoid foods that
directly trigger aninflammatory reaction, orthat
areindigestible and asaresult support harmful
bacterial growth. Cellulose canaccelerate transit
through theintestine andlower estrogen systemi-
cally (partly bysimply preventing thereabsorption
ofestrogen thathasbeen secreted bythebile), but
thelignans found inmany seeds andgrains tend to
promote inflammation. Raw carrots, forexample,
lower estrogen, while flaxmeal canincrease it.
Constipation ordiarrhea, ortheir alternation,
usually develops when there isinflammation in
thebowel. Alaxative cansometimes reduce the
inflammation, butit'simportant toidentify the
foods that contribute totheproblem. Asalad of
shredded carrot, with oilandvinegar dressing, has
agermicidal action, and isstimulating tothe
digestive processes. Most salad vegetables,
though, arelikely toproduce intestinal irritation,
directly orasaresult ofbacterial decomposition.
One orafew ofthe antiinflanlmatory
measures canoften make atremendous difference,
butforserious chronic problems, it'sbest touseas
many safe techniques aspossible, including
periodic breathing inapaper 'bag toincrease
carbon dioxide retention, andtaking niacinamide
toinhibit lipolysis, until thesigns ofinflammation
begin tosubside. Eventually, thegoal should beto
become "deficient" inthe"essential fatty acids,"
since experiments have shown that such animals
areextremely resistant toendotoxin poisoning (Li,
etal.,1990).

Deroo BJ,Archer TK. "The promoters chosen were those forthe
mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) andthegene forIkappa-
Balpha, theinhibitor oftheubiquitous transcription factor, nuclear
factor kappa B(NFkappaB). Several differences between glucocor-
ticoid and progestin activation ofthe IkappaBalpha and
MMTVpromoters were revealed. Both steroids activated the
endogenous IkappaBalpha promoter, while only glucocorticoids
activated astably integrated MMTV promoter. Incombination,
progestins enhanced glucocorticoid activation ofIkappaBalpha,
butantagonized glucocorticoid activation ofMMTV."
