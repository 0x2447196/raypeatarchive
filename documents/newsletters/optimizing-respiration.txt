Optimizing respiration means increasing the
uses ofoxygen that provide energy andincrease
functional capacity, while decreasing theforms of
oxidation that impair functioning anddecrease the
production ofuseful energy.
Ingeneral, things which areassociated with
-energy-producing respiration (such asthyroid hor-
mone, carbon dioxide, coconut oil)also roles
as"antioxidants."
In1895 Magnus-Levy demonstrated that hy-
pothyroid people have abnormally low heat pro-
duction, and that their heat production could be
brought uptonormal bygiving them thyroid sub-
stance. In1926, Otto showed that the
respiratory enzyme, containing theheme group, is
inhibited bycarbon monoxide, which binds tothat
asitdoes tohemoglobin. Warburg also
showed thatvisible light restores theactivity ofthe
respiratory enzyme bydissociating itfrom thecar-
bonmonoxide. Beginning inthe1930s, many sub-
stances were found that blocked respiration andInternational University
Optimizing respiration
Inagiven situation, people who eatmore are
healthier andlivelonger than those who eatless--
their bodies burn calories vigorously. Inone
study, fatpeople were found tobeable tomaintain
their weight ononly 700 calories perday, about a
third ofanormal calorie intake. Inanimal studies,
too, thefast-metabolizers livelonger than theani-
mals that don't burn calories sofast. When ani-
mals arefed acalorie-restricted diet, and live
longer than their adlibfedrelatives, people liketo
saythat their "metabolic rate isdepressed," but
that isn't true: theunder-fed animals aresmaller
than theadlibeaters, buteach gram oftheir tis-
suebums energy atahigher rate.
The biological value oftheantioxidants isthat
they allow oxygen tobeused productively, rather
than destructively. When something interferes
with thenormal, productive useofoxygen, there is
agreat increase inthedestructive forms ofoxida-
tion, such aslipid peroxidation, andtheantioxida-
tive reserves become crucial. That is,decreased
respiration oftheproductive sorttends toincrease
thedestructive useofoxygen.-.J!

Many serious consequences ofex-
cess heme/porphyrin production and metabolism'·
arecurrently being investigated, suggesting that
thecriterion of"twice theupper limit ofnormal"
e,:,cretion· thatwas recently proposed byagovern-
ment agency, forrecognizing that aproblem ex-
ists, could allow farmore serious problems to
develop over time, thatonthesurface might seem
unrelated to'porphyria. Iconsider anyporphyrin
excess tobeaserious indicator ofphysiological
stress. The ramifications ofdisturbed heme
·metabolism, resulting from exogenous factors,
arefar-reaching. Forexample, G.Y.Kennedy,
attheCancer Research Laboratory, University
ofSheffield, observed that aporphyrin short-
ened thetime required toinduce tumors, and
porphyrin derivatives have been proposed to
be ttcancer hormones." The carbon monoxide
produced inthebreakdown ofheme inhibits many
enzymes. The consequences ofslight excesses in
porphyrin metabolism just haven't been investi-
gated, because ofthegenetic dogmatism that de-
.nies that theperson's environment could beat
fault.
J-he synthesis ofheme/porphyrin, andthepro-
duction ofredblood cells, ·arestimulated byalack.
ofoxygen, orbytoxins such as'arsenic andiron,
which cause oxidative stress. Emphysema, high
elevation, sluggish circulation,. and nocturnal
breathing problems cancause enough oxygen defi-
ciency tostimulate theformation ofnew redblood
cells. Newborn babies often have polycythemia, as
aresult oflimited prenatal oxygen supply. Ata
certain point, thecontinued production ofred
blood cells canmake theblood soviscous thatthis
viscosity impairs circulation through capillaries,
andcreates. avicious cirCle, stimulating theforma-
tjonofmore redblood cells. Men aremore likely
than women tohave polycythemia rubra vera, pos-
sibly-because testosterone isanabolic tothebone
marrow, andestrogen tends to slow blood cellfor-
mation (females ofallspecies arerelatively "ane-
<"fIlic," compared tomales, partly because their
blood is_more dilute), butIthink thegreater ability
ofmen's marrow torespond proliferatively tohy-
poxia isinfluenced bymany factors, including·Theheme group (ofhemoglobin andtherespi-
nitory enzymes, forexample) istheiron-binding
oilymolecule that interacts with oxygen, anditis
called aporphyrin. There isalong history ofin-
vestigating theinteractions ofporphyrin metabo-
lism with estrogen (L. C.Strong, "Sex differences
inpigment content ofHarderian glands ofmice,"
Proc. Soc. Exp. BioI. Med 50, 123-125, 1942),
with cancer (e.g., F.H.J.Figge, etal.,Cancer
Res. 2,335-342, 1942), with diet, andwith excess
iron. Estrogens areknown tocause porphyria (R.
D.Levere, Blood 28,569-572, 1966), andtoex-
acerbate the symptoms and biochemical distur-
bances in·people with subclinical porphyria.
Sometimes symptoms occur premenstrually, dur-
ingthetime ofincreased estrogen production--the
term "ovulocyclic porphyria" hasbeen inusefora
long time. Puberty therefore increases thesuscep-
tibility tosymptomatic episodes. Jaundice inpreg-
nancy andinoralcontraceptive users isprobably a
closely related phenomenon. (H. F.von Older-
shausen, Deutsch. MedJ 19,394-403, May 15,
1968.) .
Porphyrin synthesis begins atanimportant
cross-over point ofprotein andcarbohydrate me-
tabolism.· CoA andamino levulinic acid
canenter theKrebs cycle ortheporphyrin path-
way. Protein catabolism feeds into these path-
ways. Increased protein catabolism orblockage of
oxidative consumption ofKrebs cycle fuel--for ex-
ample bypoisoning--makes these precursors avail-
able to enter the porphyrin pathway.
Stress-induced oxidation ofheme can eliminate
feedback control, buttheSpecific outcome canbe
modified inmany ways.
Low blood sugar, most often caused byhypo-
thyroidism, anddiabetes--which involves poor ab-
sorption ofsugar bycelIs--both tend tolower the
respiratory quotient, theamount ofcarbon ·dioxide
produced inrelation totheamount ofoxygen
used. High carbohydrate diets, so imes with in-
suli h' erlroth,

Many people .get minor bony excrescences
(bone spurs, osteophytes, exostoses, hyperostoses)
during puberty ormenopause, oratother times of
·hormone imbalance, which often disappear sponta-
neously. This would have very little todowith the
severe oxygen states inwhich
synthesis isoverstimulated and generaLcalcifica-
tion.occurs. <Growth hormone andprolactin imbal-
ances have been suspected tohave aroleinsome
ofthese growths, andcortisol--which isisactive in
several aspects ofbone metabolism--is probably
involved (allofthese hormones areelevated byes-
trogen, andhypothyroidism isoften responsible.)
Progesterone, thyroid, bromocriptine, and other
things areavailable tonormalize thepituitary,
when thatismalfunctioning. Thebone spurs that
develop during times offluctuating thyroid func-
tion, might also bepromoted byrapid changes in
calcium andcarbon dioxide levels. (The descrip-
tionofbone mineral as"apatite" leads many peo-
pletoforget itscarbonate content.) .
Ingeneral, lactic acidintheblood canbetaken
asasignofdefective respiration, since thebreak-
down ofglucose tolactic acid increases tomake
upfordeficient oxidative energy production. Nor-
malaging seems toinvolve atendency toward ex-
cess lactic acid -production, and age-pigment is
known toactivate theprocess. Eliminating respi-
ratory toxins (such asunsaturated oils, estrogenic
andantithyroid substances, lead, andexcess iron)
isthemost obvious first step totake when there is
excess lactic acidformation. Carbon dioxide sup-
plements have been shown experimentally tore-
duce residual lactate production. Many people
experience exhilaration when they goto very high
altitudes, and itisknown that people generally
bum calories faster athigh altitude. Ithasbeen
found that, during intense exercise (which al-
ways produces alactic acid accumulation in
theblood), alower peak accumulation oflac-
{ate occurs athigh altitude, and this seems to
becaused byareduction intherate ofglycoly-
sis,orglucose consumption. (B.Grassi, etaI.)
Since there islessoxygen athigh elevation, and
since oxygen isused toconsume lactic acid, this
effect istheopposite ofwhat many people ex-
pected. Insome sense, respiration becomes more
efficient athigh altitude. Youth and increasedmucopolysaccharides inthe skin (0.I Derm. Wschr. 136, 1085, 1957).
I This is ofhypothyroid myxedema; it
hasbeen suggested that mucopolysaccharides can
actasamatrix forcalcification (W, C.Johnson, et
aI.,J.IfTVest.Derm. 43, 453, 1964). Estrogen
stimulates theformation ofcollagen (Loeb, etaI.),
andincreases itsage-like properties, andproges-
terone opposes some ofthese pro-aging effects on
connective tissues. lack ofoxygen stimu-
lates coHagen formation (Chvapil, etaI.), andthe
opposmg effects ofestrogen andprogesterone on
tissue oxygenation can'account formany ofthetis-
suechanges they produce.
Oxygen deprivation causes tissues toretain
-calcium (and iron), asdoes estrogen inmany
-cases, being similar toaging inpromoting cellular
--uptake ofcalcium. Since theporphyrins strongly
bind metals, ithasbeen suggested that they may
have aroleinmediating thedeposition ofmetals in
stressed tissues. Paroxysmal vasospasm occurs in
about 90% ofscleroderma patients, andestrogen
andadrenalin areknown tosynergize inproducing
vascular spasm;
elevations ofboth estrogen andadienalin. --
The porphyrins break down into bilirubin,'
which also poisons mitochondrial respiration (Zet-
terstrom andErnster).
Ihave known women who developed
scleroderma after beginning theuseofestrogen,
andwho were reluctant tostop, because they had
been told that estrogen would protect them from
osteoporosis and heart disease. Men who have
hadadiagnosis ofscleroderma have told methat
with theuseofthyroid and magnesium supple-
ments, epsom salts baths, andtopical progesterone
andvitamin E,their symptoms regressed. Isus-.

Polymyositis sometimes leads tocalcification,
andthiswould beexpected iftheproblem isre-
lated tomitochondrial respiration, asisnow
generally thought tobethecase; thyroid and
.magnesium areoften thefactors needed tonormal-
izemitochondria andprevent·calcification. Ingen-

glycolysis inlambda-carrageenan-wounded skeletal muscle.
Caldwell MD, Shearer J,Monis A,Mastrofrancesco B,
Henry W,Albina JE"Classically, increased lactate produc-
tion inwounded tissue isascribed toanaerobic glycolysis
although itsoxygen consumption has been found tobe
similar tonormal tissue. This apparent inconsistency was
studied inastandardized isolated perfused wound model.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were wounded (group W)with
intramuscular injections oflambda-carrageenan and fedad
lib.;notwounded andpair fedtothedecreased food intake
ofthewounded animals (group PFC); ornotwounded and
fedadlib.(group ALC). After 5days, thehindlimbs of
animals from each group were either perfused using a
standard perfusate with added [U-14C]gJucose or
[1-14C]pyruvate orassayed forthetissue content oflactate
andpyruvate. Inaddition, theeffect ofa30"/0 hemorrhage on
thetissue lactate andpyruvate concentration was examined.
Wounding increased glucose uptake and lactate produc-
tion by100 and 96%, respectively, above that seen in
ALC animals. Oxygen consumption was unchanged by
wounding (5.74, 5.14, and 5.83 mumole/min/l00 ginW,
PFC, and ALC, respectively). Glucose andpyruvate oxida-
tion were also unaltered among thegroups. Hemorrhage
resulted inacomparable increase inlactate andpyruvate in
tissue from wounded and pair-fed control animals (above
those concentrations found intissue harvested without
preexisting hemorrhage). As aconsequence, the same
relationship inUP ratio was maintained after hemorrhage.
Taken together, these results confirm the presence of
aerobic glycolysis inwounded tissue (unchanged oxygen
conSumption, glucose, and pyruvate oxidation). Inaddition,
pyruvate dehydrogenase activity inthewound was appar-
ently thesame asthat found inmuscle from pair-fed control
animals. "
Food Chern Toxicol 1984 Aug;22(8):615-621 Effect of
orally administered food-grade carrageenans onantibody-
mediated and cell-mediated immunity inthe inbred rat.
Nicklin S,Miller K"Experiments were performed toinvesti-
gate theimmunological consequences associated with the
persorption ofpoorly degradable carregeenans from thediet.
Using aninbred strain ofratitwas demonstrated histochemi-
cally, bythe carrageenan-specific Alcian blue staining
technique, that small quantities of food-grade
carrageenans given at0.5% indrinking-water for90
days could penetrate the intestinal barrier ofadult
animals. This apparently occurred viaanintact mucosa
intheabsence ofinflammatory orpathological lesions.
The carrageenan was demonstrated inmacrophage-like
cells present within thevilli and lamina propria ofthe
'all intestine. The oral administration ofkappa, lambda or
"'"lod-grade carrageenans didnotaffect local (biliary) or
antibody responses to gut commensalmicroorganisms, ortoorally-administered sheep erythro-
cytes. However, when sheep redblood cells were adminis-
tered parenterally the ensuing anti-sheep red blood cell
haema.,gglutinating antibody response was temporarily
suppressed incarrageenan-fed rats. lambda-Carrageenan and
iota-carrageenan both significantly (pless than orequal to
0.01 andPlessthan orequal to0.05, respectively) reduced
themid-phase (14-28 days) haemagglutinin response; kappa-
carrageenan (LI00)was lesseffective butcaused significant
depression atday21(Plessthan orequal to0.01). Individ-
ualresponses were, however, within thecontrol range 35
days after sheep erythrocyte administration, thus indicating
thetemporary nature ofthis effect. Although carrageenan
administration depressed theanti-sheep erythrocyte antibody
response, itdidnot affect T-cell immune competence as
measured bythepopliteal lymph node assay forgraft-versus-
host reactivity."

Shiau SY,Chang GW "Apparent intestinal permeability was
determined indirectly byorally administering apoorly
absorbed dye, phenol red,toratsandmeasuring itsrecovery
infeces and inurine. Increased apparent permeability was
recognized byincreased dye recovery inurine and byan
increased ratio ofurinary tofecal dyerecovery. Guar gum,

carrageenan type II(iota) and cellulose were each fedat
