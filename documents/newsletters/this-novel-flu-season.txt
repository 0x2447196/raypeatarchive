This Novel Flu Season
The argument:  
A failure of energy metabolism limits the ability
of cells to return from an excited active state to astable resting state. Unresolved excitation causescells to emit signals indi cating the need for repair,
inflammatory signals. Pr e-existing inflammation is
associated with high altitude sickness and theability to get sick from a corona virus, as well aschronic diseases. This implies that treatment for aso-called “coronavirus infection” should be toreduce cellular excitation and inflammation andnormalize energy production. It also implies thatthese treatments will have favorable effects on cell
aging.
The conditions that produce inflammation
activate the adaptive exosome system, a retrotrans-poson system involving a massive block of ourDNA, which overlaps with  the virus production
mechanism. Current approaches to preventingviral disease dangerously ignore this fundamentalphysiological-genetic system. An important impli-cation of this system’s in volvement in health and
disease is that we are not defined “somas”produced once by our DNA, but rather adaptive,epigenetic, ongoing creative beings.
U.S. history has repeatedly hinged on words that
didn’t correspond to facts, for example the bombingof Vietnam based on the fictional Tonkin Gulfincident, or the invasion of Iraq based on the yellow-cake uranium and other fictional weapons of massdestruction. To explain the present destruction of thenormal US economy it would be reasonable to lookfor some clear image to indicate that China’s newvariant corona virus was more dangerous thanpreceding strains of the virus, but there has been
no public information about how to distinguishinfections with this new virus from other acutelung problems. According to official medicalviews, no specific treatment or test was knownwhen the WHO declared the pandemic, so theFDA has bypassed its normal regulations for bothtests and drugs. A test, to be useful in diagnosis,determining the exact cause of symptoms, wouldhave to show whether any of the common respira-tory disease organisms was present, and naturally,any test has to be tested itself. The CDC hasobserved that half of the positives on an antibodytest, in a population with low prevalence, could befalse. A muddle of tests has created confusioneven among experts; on May 21, the CDCacknowledged that it was mixing together theircounts of antibody tests and PCR virus tests. 
In March and April, several Stanford profes-
sors were arguing that the lethality of the newvirus was very similar to that of the familiar influ-enzas, about 0.25% of those infected. The latestfigures from the CDC, published inconspicuouslyon May 22, were similar, assuming that 35% ofinfected people could be symptom free; if a higherpercentage of infections are symptom free, thenthe infection-death rate is even lower.
With no public explanation of the pathophysi-
ology of the “new disease,” the vacuum was filledby rumors that it was a virus escaped from germwarfare labs, alternately said to be from Wuhan orFort Detrick, and several broadly circulatedarticles denied that such a virus was even possibleto engineer, conflicting with articles in majorjournals in recent years describing exactly thatengineering (de Haan, et al., 2008; Graham andBaric, 2010). In the absence of empirical informa-tion about the nature of the disease, but with the

Not for republication without written permission.rumors creating fear of a uniquely horrible disease,
hospitals have been instructing doctors to treatpatients with breathing problems in very aggressiveand invasive, and standardized, ways.
A couple of doctors in the US said publicly that
those treatments aren’t appropriate for the realdisease. Cameron Kyle-Sidell has made two videosobserving that his patients’ symptoms resemblethose of people with high altitude pulmonary edema,
a feature of which is very low carbon dioxide as
well as low oxygen.   Another doctor in New York,
Isaac Solaimanzadeh, suggested using calciumchannel blockers and acetazolamide to treat the newdisease, because of their therapeutic effect in highaltitude pulmonary edema. He didn’t mention it, butboth of these drugs can correct the tissue deficiencyof carbon dioxide. 
In Germany, Luciano Gattinoni (Gattinoni, et al.,
2020) pointed out that the standard ventilation proto-col wasn’t conforming to the best knowledge ofrespiratory physiology. He observed that in oneconventional hospital the mortality of respiratorypatients was 60%, while in a nearby hospital follow-ing his more rational method, the mortality of respi-ratory patients was zero.
High altitude physiology is obviously confusing
to the many doctors who have scoffed at thecomparison of the new disease to high altitudepulmonary edema. This is because of the way physi-ology is taught. At low altitude, when a tissue’soxygen consumption increases beyond the blood’sability to deliver oxygen, as in an intensely workingmuscle, the tissue activates the glycolytic process,converting glucose to lactic acid as a source ofadditional energy. Carbon dioxide is seen as nothingbut a waste disposal problem. This view has led tothe concept of the “high altitude lactate paradox,”referring to the fact that maximal exertion at highaltitude doesn’t increase lactic acid production in thenormal way. Neglecting the role of carbon dioxide in
suppressing the formation of lactic acid, they alsoneglect all of its other essential metabolic effects,including its role as the factor whose absence resultsin the syndromes of altitude sickness, and ventilator-induced lung damage (Sinclair, et al., 2002;Cummins, et al., 2010; Contreras, et al., 2012). 
This CO2-negligent approach to physiology
has affected medicine for 100 years.  When Otto
Warburg discovered that aerobic glycolysis is thedefining feature of cancer, the presence of a little
extra lactate in the blood, displacing CO2, didn’tappear to most doctors and biologists to bemedically important, though a little extra carbondioxide could arouse concern. Ignoring that 30years of slightly elevated lactate might lead tocancer or other degenerative disease, those whotaught physiological chemistry also had littleinterest in the idea of chronic metabolic hyperven-tilation—losing a little too much CO2 even at sea
level. Cumulative injury of all sorts contribute
to a background of inappropriate excitation
and inflammation.
In studies related to asthma, it has become
well known that abnormally low CO2,hypocapnia, constricts the airways, andelevated CO2, hypercapnia, relaxes them ( El
Mays, et al., 2011; Choudhury, et al., 2012);various mechanisms, affecting intracellularcalcium, are known to be involved. The causes ofrelative hyperventilation continue to be disputed.
The basic principles of respiration, the Bohr
and Haldane effects, describe the physicalequilibria of oxygen and CO2 in people who haveadapted to living at different altitudes. TheHaldane effect describes the fact that increasedoxygen pressure decreases the amount of carbondioxide retained by hemoglobin, and decreasedoxygen pressure increases the amount of CO2retained. A steady increase of retained CO2 withincreasing altitude occurs in those who adapt.People who fail to adapt experience a loss of CO2,with an increase of lactate. 
It has become increasingly common to treat
altitude sickness with carbon dioxide. A few
people have argued for a long time that
mechanical ventilation would be less harmful ifa mixture of CO2 and O2 were used  (Laffey and
Kavanagh, 1999; Kregenow and Swenson, 2002),analogously to the therapeutic effect of CO2 inhigh altitude sickness (Harvey, et al., 1988).
In a state of chronic stress, oxidative energy
production is low, and mediators of inflamma-tion are likely to be chronically increased;there is typically a chronically increasedproduction of lactate, and/or decreased oxida-tion of it.  In this state, the increased ventilation
caused by high altitude will cause an increasedloss of carbon dioxide, increasing the pH of the2blood, which increases the formation of lactic acid.
The lactate increases the leakiness of capillaries andloss of fluid, and decreases the ability of oxygen todiffuse from the alveolus to the erythrocyte. Sincecarbon dioxide diffuses many times more rapidlythan oxygen, this diffusion barrier results in lowblood CO2 at the same time as hypoxia. Even at sealevel, an increase of lactate immediately increasesthe lungs’ diffusion barrier.    
Thinking of the infection as the disease, and
therefore considering the “receptor,” “entry,” andreplication of the virus to be sufficient to explain thedamage to infected cells, tissues, and organs, anddefining the disease as an inflammation of the respi-ratory tree and lung, the hospital system went intoaction. Failing to think of the intestine (which isinfected as easily as the nose and lungs), themeaning of events throughout the organism, includ-ing the lungs, is misunderstood.  The infection canserve as one of the factors increasing inflammationand stress, suppressing energy function, but therelevant disease to be treated is that unstable state ofcounter-productive, energy-depleting excitatory andinflammatory signals.
Healthy individuals aren’t harmed by the
presence of the virus, so the nature of the defectthat makes some people susceptible should be thefocus of attention.  Some important factors have
already been identified: living at high altitudeprovides 3- or 4-fold protection (Arias-Reyes, et al.,2020), and being a young woman is even moreprotective. In Italy, 70% of the deaths are men, butdeaths increase sharply among post-menopausalwomen.
The lungs are especially sensitive to activation of
the so-called “calcium channels,” i.e., calciumuptake by cells, by hypoxia, causing constriction ofblood vessels, but increased carbon dioxide, whichincreases during adaptation to altitude, reverses thehypertension caused by hypoxia (Baudouin andEvans, 1993; Chuang, et al., 2011). Calcium channelblockers, paralleling that effect of CO2, are effectivetreatments for high altitude pulmonary hypertension.Like acetazolamide, the other recognized treatmentfor altitude sickness, calcium channel blockersinhibit carbonic anhydrase, facilitating the body’sretention of CO2. To the medical scoffers who denythat CO2 has a constructive physiological role, theexaggerated pulmonary constriction at high altitudeis the cause of the lung failure, while in therespiratory distress caused by Covid-19 that
contriction is a consequence of the disease (Luksand Swenson, 2020), and neither is a result of aCO2 deficiency. 
The presence of lactate corresponds to some
degree of reductive excess in cells, and the degreeof reduction regulates the “calcium channels,”controlling the excitatory effects of intracellularcalcium (Wang, et al., 1997; Iesaki and Wolin,2000; Schach, et al., 2007). Reduction by stressand/or lactate “activates the channels,” tighteningvascular smooth muscle, and activating a widerange of other cell activities, including inflamma-tion, exosome secretion, and viral replication(Savina, et al., 2003; Chen, et al., 2019). Exosomeproduction during stress is part of the body’snormal restorative function (Zhang, et al., 2017);it’s only when protective factors such as proges-terone and carbon dioxide are lacking that theirproduction becomes counter-productive.
Progesterone and its neuroactive metabolites
including tetrahydroprogesterone or allopreg-nanolone, are very effective “calcium channelblockers” (Todorovic, et al., 2004; Pathirathna, etal., 2005; Hu, et al., 2007). A major function ofprogesterone is the inactivation of the estrogenreceptor; estrogen and its “receptor” are powerfulactivators of cellular calcium uptake (Sarkar, etal., 2008).
Studies of progesterone’s effects on recovery
of nerve function after traumatic brain damagehave found that vitamin D increases its effective-ness. By improving calcium homeostasis, oppos-ing the effects of the parathyroid hormone whichactivates calcium channels, vitamin D(25-hydroxycholecalciferol) is coming to beconsidered a neurosteroid (Groves, et al., 2014;Gezen-Ak and Dursun, 2019), as well as an essen-tial factor in immunity (Pfeffer and Hawrylowicz,2012).
Intracellular calcium is essential for all
aspects of the viral cycle—entry, gene replica-tion, maturation, and release—while alsodisturbing the cell’s own functions.  “Evidence
has emerged that pharmacologically targeting thecalcium channel or calcium release from theendoplasmic reticulum … can obstruct viruslifecycles” (Chen, et al., 2019). 3A few doctors recognize that progesterone
supplementation might seem reasonable forpreventing or treating the corona virus problem,though they don’t seem to know about its alreadyestablished antiviral effects  (Pfahler, et al., 1987;
Muñoz, et al., 2007; Hall, et al., 2016), or themechanisms involved. Other doctors (SharonNachman), following their cliché thinking instilledby estrogen industry advertising, and believing thatestrogen is “the female hormone” that explainswomen’s health advantages, have begun a study,treating the corona infection in men with estrogenpatches. Old men’s estrogen levels, especially iftheir health is poor, can be higher than that ofwomen of the same age, while their progesterone isalways lower. 
Nitric oxide is a powerful oxidant that can
destroy viruses, and it happens to dilate bloodvessels. Doctors have almost unanimously recom-mended it to treat the corona virus infection;however, it is associated with inflammation(Weidinger, et al., 2015), and promotes fibrosis, andfibrosis is a sequela of coronavirus disease. Anincreased amount of nitric oxide in the exhaledbreath is a clear predisposing factor for high altitudesickness (Ren, et al., 2015). Progesterone is a respi-ratory stimulant that increases the hypoxic ventila-tory response, and a low hypoxic ventilatoryresponse is another predisposing factor to highaltitude sickness. Progesterone inhibits the formationof nitric oxide (Wolfson, et al., 2015), while estro-gen increases it (Lima, et al., 2014).
For years, corona viruses have been known to
bind to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2), and that enzyme has been known to haveprotective effects, destroying angiotensin, and losar-tan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, has been knownto be protective against corona viruses. Angiotensinincreases intracellular calcium, and losartan lowers
intracellular calcium. In reaction to the new corona
virus, a few groups responded quickly, treating
successfully with antiinflammatory things—losar-tan, cinanserin (a serotonin antagonist), aspirin,and azithromycin or erythromycin, which lowerintracellular calcium. Aspirin’s effects overlapthose of losartan, and it downregulates the angio-tensin receptor, ATR1  (Mitra, et al., 2012). 
Meanwhile, medical media, such as Lancet,
immediately warned against the use ofanti-angiotensin drugs, as if the authors and
editors hadn’t been reading respiratory physiologyin recent years. This is because of the stupefyingeffects of the receptor dogma. Having identifiedACE2 as the “coronavirus receptor,” nothingphysiological matters. Graded, holistic effects,involving simultaneous changes in many “recep-tors,” in which rising inflammation can lead toviral replication, suggesting many safe therapeuticinterventions, simply don’t fit into the paradigmof product “development” and marketing. 
The closed, authoritarian nature of the medical
profession makes it a perfect tool for politicalmanipulation. Obstructing the use of rational treat-ments, the profession has been mobilized topromote the militarization of the national responseto the latest respiratory virus, the history of whichshows the massive involvement of the USmilitary. Ralph Baric’s publications on the coronavirus, as well as dissenting opinions amongvirologists and in government (Nature, Nov. 12,2012; The Scientist Magazine, Nov. 16, 2012),make it clear that military-motivated gain offunction virus research has been able to override apresidential moratorium, and the actions of EricSchmidt and his National Defense Commission onArtificial Intelligence (proposing responses togrowing Chinese power), and his recent appoint-ment by Governor Cuomo to help reorganize NewYork’s schools, health system, and economy, offernew perspectives on the government’s surprisingactions. The fact that Italy and Iran last yearsigned an agreement to participate in China’sexpansive trade plan might be relevant to evaluat-ing the meaning of this novel flu season.
Since the recognition that only 1% or 2% of
our DNA consists of “our genes,” and that around48% shows features specifying retroviruses, manygeneticists are suggesting that retroviruses, trans-ferring their RNA information into our DNA, areour ancestors. The reason for this crazy thought isprobably to avoid as far as possible the radicalabandonment of the Central Dogma of genetics,that information flows only from nucleic acids toproteins. Now that the protective and adaptivefunctions of exosomes and retrotransposons havebeen clarified, the more obvious inference mightbe that we are the ancestor of retroviruses, thoughthe real implication is that we are essentially4adaptive, epigenetic, creative beings. The “germ
line” is everywhere, not insulated in the gonads.
Vaccine adjuvants are designed to produce
systemic inflammation,  and that involves some
degree of activation of our innate immunity with its
epigenetic adaptive potential. Recognizing that a
barely recognizable background of inflammation
predisposes to develop serious sickness from acorona virus,  it’s important to consider the role
of the recent great expansion of the influenza
vaccination campaigns in Italy and the US,especially directed at older people, in the currentincreased incidence of corona infections.  Several
studies, designed to judge the effectiveness of theinfluenza vaccine, reported that the vaccine might beabout 45% effective in reducing influenza infections,but that the vaccinated people were much morelikely to have other respiratory infections, includingcorona virus infections. 
Focus on the induction of antibodies by vaccines
to define immunity has led to a dangerous disregardfor the basic facts of health. The present testing of avaccine containing the RNA that specifies the mostdestructive spike protein of the corona virus, the partthat inactivates our protective ACE2 enzyme, isbeing done in a culture that avoids consideration ofthe meaning of our massive endogenous system ofRNA-responsive reverse transcriptases and retroele-ments. The consequences of incorporating the spikeprotein of the virus into our genetic repertoire are
hard to imagine. The mindless activation of our
huge epigenetic system of retroelements, with no
knowable benefits, should be stopped.
