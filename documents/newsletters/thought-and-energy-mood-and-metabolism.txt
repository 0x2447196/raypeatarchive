Thought and energy, mood
and metabolism
"Thought doesn't take any energy, thinking
doesn't increase thebrain's metabolic rate." For
several decades, that was thereceived opinion of
theprofessionals inpsychology andneurology. An
experiment was cited. Butanyone who knew how
tothink knew otherwise: Hard thought would
increase your temperature, prolonged hard thought
would make you hungry, and ifyou didn't eat,
prolonged hard thought could make yousick.
The energetic physiology ofnerves and
muscles had been studied and itwas clear that a
stimulated nerve expended energy and consumed
energy atahigher rate than aresting nerve. The
people who chose tobelieve thesilly doctrine
about brain metabolism had tobelieve that the
activity ofthenerves inthebrain was nomore
intense during intense thought than atrest. Itwas
something that should have been impossible to
believe, sortoflike themagic bullet theory ofthe
Warren Commission, inwhich the bullet that
killed thepresident later injured thegovernor in
several places, leaving several metal fragments in
hisbody, and then was found undamaged ona
stretcher. With astrong reason tobelieve
anything canbebelieved, andtheconsequences of
holding that belief can begreat, seeming to
validate thereason forchoosing tobelieve.

In the nineteenth century, Sechenov had
explained thebrain's activity interms ofnervous
reflexes. Vvedensky, Pavlov, and Anokhin had
refined theimplications of-that view. Butanother
school condemned thereflex theory ofmental
activity ascrude materialism, and argued, like
that the brain's activity was
unmaterial, spiritual, andsymbolic.
John Eccles, who was themost prestigious
neurologist inEngland andAmerica, argued that
consciousness was completely immaterial. He
took Heisenberg's "uncertainty principle" asa
way toargue* that physical laws didn't really
control thebrain, thatthewhole system hinged on
indeterminacy, and that therandomness ofthat
hypothetical microscopic level provided a
foothold fortheimmaterial soul inthebrain.
Noam Chomsky went directly from Descartes'
view oftheimmaterial consciousness tohuman
grammar, arguing that itwas not necessary to
investigate thebrain atali,tobeable tounder-
stand how we can produce and understand
language. Ifasetofrules could "account for" or
in mathematical language, "generate," th;
grammatical structure oflanguage, the rules
would adequately describe the"genetic endow-
ment" (itself asetofrules) that made language
possible. The brain itself was tobetreated asa
"black box," whose function wastobeinferred by

analysis oflanguage (or,rather, bythedevising of
asetofrules which areconsistent with theways
language isused), without examining thecontents
ofthebox.
Every field ofcultural activity wasaffected by
these doctrines thatfeared theidentification ofthe
mental and thematerial. Neokantianism intro-
duced theidea that ourperceptions arelimited by
ourgenetic endowment, andthatasaresult ofthat
limitation, what weperceive isinreality only a
symbolic abstraction.
Insociology, "symbolic interactionism," and
inpsychology, anthropology and linguistics
various "structuralist" and "functionalist"
doctrines offered antimaterialist ways todescribe
reality. Konrad Lorenz, serving asthetheoretician
ofgenocide, applied these ideas toanthropology
and biology. Sociobiology and ethology arethe
current forms ofLorenz's doctrine. While
symbolic interactionism hasbeen used tojustify
cultural relativism, and sociobiology has been
used tojustify genocide, both ofthese seemingly
opposite schools grew outofsimilar commitments
toanabstracted andsymbolic view ofreality.
The school of"Artificial Intelligence" derives
from, and iscommitted to,this immaterial,
symbolic view ofconsciousness. The idea of
"neural networks" would seem tohave incorpo-
rated amaterial foundation, butactually ithas
only reassimilated thetheoretical language that
wasused bytheneurologists oftheEccles school
ofsymbolic, immaterial, neurology. The image of
acomputer was imposed onto thebrain, andthen
thistheoretical description, inwhich "neural" no
longer carried anysubstantial, metabolic meaning,
was able tobeused initsdenatured form bythe
immaterialists.
Inrecent years, new technologies such as
NMRIMRI have been able toshow many
metabolic details ofthe brain during different
kinds ofmental activity, and indifferent
sicknesses. 25years ago, N.P.Bekhtereva
demonstrated that specific electrical patterns
corresponding toacertain word orimage could be
identified inthebrain, and recently theUSCIA
has funded research inwhich brain waves
measured onthesurface ofthescalp canclearlyshow whether certain words orimages have
special significance foraperson.
When the studies ofbrain chemistry and
electrical activity arecombined, itbecomes clear
thatmoods andmeanings interact with metabolic
processes inbiologically rational ways, that have
todowith adaptation oftheorganism toits
environment. The "content" ofour experience,
and our substantial metab<:>lism aresoclosely
linked thatthere isnoway toradically distinguish
them.
R.D.Laing and Carl Rogers described the
process ofseeing theworld astheclient sees it,
andthey hadvaluable insights into themeanings
of"psychopathology." But they still operated
within a"symbolically constructed" reality, ignor-
ingthemetabolic, physiological aspects oftheir
clients' problems.
Theability toperceive one's environment and
adapt toitdepends onhaving one's metabolic
requirements met, and these chemical andphysi-
calissues areusually overlooked bypsychiatrists,
justastheissues of"meaning" may beoverlooked
bythephysiologists.
Responding toparticular people andparticular
demands cancreate organic andcellular patterns
inwhich theglands, intestines, liver, nerves, and
muscles adapt appropriately. The physiological
pattern accomodates itself tothedemands, butthe
organism's resources aren't always able torestore
theoriginal state, when thedemands arenolonger
being made. Inadequate nutrition and inadequate
stimulation limit adaptiveness, andcreate rigidity
ofbehavior. Learned helplessness describes a
global inability toadapt, that's produced by
inescapable stress, but something like learned
helplessness andunavoidable stress pervades our
society, creating pathological rigidities.
Theability toperceive possibilities, andtoact
on those perceptions, requires biological
resources, especially ahigh level ofenergy, but
there must also berealpossibilities intheenviron-
ment. Several studies over thelast forty years
have shown that depressed and paranoid people
have more accurate perceptions oftheir situation
than happy optimists do.
The interlocking mental rigidities ofmillions
ofpeople areaproblematic kind ofadaptation. A
slight fluctuation insocial relationships, such as
losing ajoborgetting divorced, cancause tremen-
dous changes inboth perceived and real
possibilities.
Dostoyevsky was interested inthe"interlock-
ingmental rigidities," and invarious moral or
spiritual alternatives. InRussian society, hesaid,
psychopathology was the norm, lies could be
therapeutic, andtruth was themost poetic thing in
theworld ["Something about lying," 1873.] He
used what might have been called, inthe20th
century, themes of "anomie," to explore
consciousness and values. "Everything is
meaningless," or"everything islawful," instead of
leading tosuicide orcrime, could lead toan
exalted view oflife's possibilities. Dostoyevski
wrote about his own "nervous illness," that
included alternating depression and ecstasy, and
that has been considered tobesome sort of
epilepsy orschizophrenia. Whatever hismental
illness was, hehadaremarkable recovery when he
was arrested and sent toprison. Before hisarrest,
hehadbeen onavegetarian diet, butintheprison
inSiberia hewas given adaily portion of
hamburger.
Many people have experienced adramatic
improvement ofmood when they began eating
more protein. Onalow protein orstarvation diet,
thebody experiences, indifferent proportions, the
"stress" reaction andthe"hibernation" reaction.
Animmediate reaction tohunger istosecrete
adrenal in,which draws glucose from theliver and
fatsfrom thefatty tissues. When theliver's glyco-
gen isdepleted, cortisol isproduced tomobilize
amino acids from muscles and other tissues, to
provide energy.
Muscle protein isvery rich intryptophan and
cysteine, and these amino acids suppress the
thyroid gland's function, and arepotentially toxic
tonerves, especially inthepresence ofcortisol
and hypoglycemia. Tryptophan isturned into
serotonin, which promotes lipid peroxidation,
blood clotting, andcertain patterns ofnerve activ-
ity.Serotonin cansuppress mitochondrial respira-
tion, andalong with thereduced body temperature
thatitproduces, apattern oftorpor orhelplessness
tends tobeproduced.3
Butanother pattern canbeproduced bystress,
inwhich adrenaline and related substances
maintain body temperature and alertness, despite
themetabolic inefficiency. Inhypothyroidism, it
iscommon foradrenaline ornoradrenaline tobe
produced invery large amounts. The brain and
pituitary hormones (thyroid stimulating hormone,
TSH, anditsrelease hormone, TRH) that tend to
increase inhypothyroidism, 路have their own brain
modifying effects, increasing alertness and atten-
tion. Hypothyroidism can also cause hypersecre-
tion ofACTH, adrenocorticotropin, which isalso
apowerful brain stimulant.
These two different reactions tostress, viz.,
torpor ortension, depression orhyper-alertness,
areoften seen asreactions toover-sleeping, or
under-sleeping. On aSunday, when aperson
sleeps anextra hour ortwo, it'scommon tofeel
lethargic fortherest oftheday. And when a
person hastogetupseveral hours tooearly, there
isoften thefeeling ofbeing over-stimulated.
Many years ago, someone noticed that
depressed people who missed anight's sleep, or
who were wakened several hours earlier than
normal, came outoftheir depression, until they
caught upontheir sleep. Sleep deprivation has
become arecognized treatment fordepression.
Manic-depressive ("bipolar") people typically
seem toneed very little sleep during their manic
periods.
Indepression, there isexcessive influence of
serotonin, inmania, excessive influence of
adrenaline. These chemicals arelinks between
energy metabolism and many specific adaptive
physiological processes. One pattern ofnerve
activity, corresponding to these metabolic
patterns, inclines aperson toseetheimpossibility
orfutility ofeverything, theother causes anincli-
nation tooverlook impediments and undesirable
consequences. Ineither state, important parts of
reality areexcluded.
Apart from these moods that canbeinduced
bytheinteractions' ofdiet, hormones, and the
demands oropportunities oftheenvirnoment, the
liveliness and vigor ofmetabolism influence the
rhythms ofthought andbehavior, andtherichness
of experience and the appropriateness of
activities. Onasuperficial level, our ability to
handle information can becompared tothat ofa
computer, butthat metaphor neglects ournatural
existence, that islike avortex ofbiochemical and
physical interactions, aswell asbeing anassimila-
torand projector ofimpressions, meanings, and
intentions. Inacomputer, theinformation being
processed isseparate from thehardware doing the
processing, but inus,there isnoinformation,
message, content, ormemory that isdistinct from
our living substance. Living substance isn't a
collection ofdistinct objects that can beinthis
state orthat state, because living substance isa
process, always renewing itself with more orless
appropriateness foritschanging situations. Every
state ofconsciousness isastate ofbeing.
Let's look briefly attheway Anglo-American
neurology came tolook atthebrain asacomputer.
For many years, thedogma said that thebrain-
computer was "hard wired," meaning that the
arrangement ofthenerves was genetically deter-
mined, setforever during fetal life, and altered
only asindividual nerve cells died during learning
and aging. Since computer wires carried only
on/off signals, nerves would carry only on/off
signals: When anerve "fired," itwas said tobe
analogous toan"on-current," and therest ofthe
time itwas "off." The nerve's electrical activity
(contrary toclear evidence) was dogmatically
identified with the superficial '''lipid bilayer
membrane," which was said tohave only two
states, open andclosed. This abstract andincorrect
description ofanindividual nerve was originally
adopted because many neurologists, inthedays
before computers, wanted tobeable todescribe
thebrain as"atelephone swithchboard," handling
messages, however, that were assimple asthe
patterned clicks oftelegraphy. Information was
one thing, theswitching machinery was another
thing.
The school ofPavlov (contrary toAnglo-
American dogma) setouttounderstand conscious-
ness, sowhen they thought ofnerves, they avoided
assumptions derived from telegraphy. There has
never been any good reason toview nerves as
wires carrying only simple "telegraphic" informa-
tion. P.K.Anokhin, inhislastbook, discussed the
reasons forbelieving that individual nerves handle
complex information complexly. In practical4
fields, such asthephysiology ofhearing, there has
been recognition that individual nerves seem to
transmit qualitative, complex, messages.
The idea ofa"hard-wired" computer-like
brain was conditioned atevery level bythe
philosophy oftheimmateriality ofconsciousness.
The idea oftelegraphic electrical impulses hardly
changed when "neurotransmitter" chemicals were
discovered: They just provided links between the
filaments that still carried only on/off information.
The idea that nerve cell metabolism isconscious-
ness isstillexcuded from theruling doctrine.
Since Ihave been interested intheway that
hypothyroidism, aT3deficiency, causes sleep
problems, Ihave seen similar patterns inseveral
seemingly different conditions. Atmenopause,
insomnia, hypothyroidism, anddiabetes arelikely
todevelop along with hot flushes. Although
hypothyroidism often causes thetemperature tobe
subnormal, Isaw many women whose tempera-
ture before breakfast was normal, butthen fell
after breakfast, usually following some hotflushes
andsweats. Gradually, Ibegan torealize that this
corresponded toextremely high adrenalin and
cortisol inthemorning, and that high morning
temperature was sometimes thefirst sign ofthe
developmg "hyper-alert" state, though most often
itjust represented thestress and exhaustion that
result from disturbed, inefficient, sleep.
Using asmall dose ofT3normally causes an
increase oftemperature and pulse rate, but in
these people who areinanextremely adrenergic
state, theT3causes both thetemperature andheart
rate todecrease, as itrestores metabolic
efficiency. Then, asthestress state disappears, the
thyroid supplements will gradually begin tobring
themetabolic rate, temperature, and pulse upto
normal. When anormal body temperature is
maintained by thyroid-supported respiration,
rather than bythe stress hormones, sleep is
efficient.
Thyroid, especially D, has been commonly
used inthetreatment ofdepression, andthere are
many indications that, as itrelieves the
depression, itisalso correcting astate ofstress,
lowering the cortisol which is typically
chronically increased indepression, and making
sleep restful, rather than debilitating.
Women areespecially susceptible todepres-
sion, diabetes, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis,
Alzheimer's disease, and many other conditions
that derive fairly directly from impaired energy
metabolism. Some people have proposed that
psychiatric problems areequivalent to"neural
diabetes." "Syndrome X"(insulin resistance with
heart symptoms) represents anadvance toward
seeing energy metabolism asthecentral biomedi-
calissue.
Adequate dietary protein, andtheability touse
itefficiently, should have thehighest priority in
the treatment and prevention ofnervous and
emotional problems, regardless ofwhether the
diagnosis is"bipolar disorder," "depression,"
"schizophrenia," "multiple sclerosis," "obsessive
compulsive disorder," orother official psychiatric
category.
Without other nutrients, including sugar, much
ofthedietary protein isconverted toenergy, and
without good thyroid function, protein can't be
used properly. Whey, soyprotein, andother indus-
trial by-products sold asprotein supplements
aren't safe. Eating avariety ofanimal proteins,
with some fruits andpotatoes, isthesafest way to
prevent the metabolic disruptions caused by
protein malnutrition.

significantly increased inhypothyroid rats as
