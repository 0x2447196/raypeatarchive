Recharging the System
Adelle Davis wrote about theimportance of
.increased saltintake inadrenal failure, andanimal
experimenters have that with ade-
quate sodium andsugar, animals canfunction nor-
mally withollt their adrenals. Hans Selye
demonstrated that progesterone supplements keep
animals healthy fortheir entire life after their
adrenals have been removed. Among itsmany ef-
fects, progesterone regulates thelevels ofsodium
andglucose.
Progesterone isboth anantistress hormone
.andanantishock hormone; shock isthestate that
occurs when ourdefenses aredown, and stress is
just a little higher on the scale or resistance, and
neither will occur when our resources areade-
quate. Inanybadbiological estrogen is
likely toaccumulate, interfering with energy pro-
duction, causing blood topool inthelegs, causing
water retention andsodium loss.
Thyroid, progesterone, protein, and salt are
powerful defenses against allsorts ofstress-
associated symptoms, including hotflashes, insom-
nia,cramps, PMS, edema, toxemia ofpregnancy,
low-birth-weight babies, epilepsy, heart diseases,
hypertension, strokes, migraine, inflammatory dis-
eases, hypoglycemia, fatigue anddepression. The
first approach toanappropriate dietwould beto
useatleast aquart ofmilk andaquart oforange
juice daily, well salted chicken broth, andfrequent
snacks, especially salty foods. Ihave written be-
fore about theimportance offiuit andprotein in
balancing thehormones, andhow adequate energy
prevents stress, butIhaven't talked about sodium's
.central biological role insustaining our energy,
and the mechanisms behind these effects ofdiet
andhormones.
Shock isthemost extreme stress-state there is,
anditcanshift gradually intodeath, asenergy pro-
duction ceases. Things thatcanbring anindividual
outofshock aresointimately contlected with our
energy production thatweshould understand how
tousethem routinely.
Inshock, G.W.Crne showed that many sys-
tems, ranging from themolecular level tothenerv-
ouslevel, areinvolved, andheintroduced methods
ofanesthesia thatreduced shock. Heimagined the
organism--and each cell--as something like an
electrical battery: The liver andthebrain formed
thepoles oftheorganism-battery, andthenucleus
andcytoplasm formed thecell's ".poles." Exhaus-
tion and shock, hebelieved, insome way "dis-
charged" theorganism's energy, causing changes
inevery cell. 
Isuspect that Crile's work onthephysiology
ofexcitement, exhaustion, aridshock made Hans
Selye's work onstress andadaptation "less unac-
ceptable" tothescientific establishment' than it
would have been without Crile's disturbing prece-
dent. Crile warned about theshock-promoting ac-
tion ofmorphine, and influenced theway surgery
.was done, bl:1tunfortunately shock isstilltoooften
thought ofinamechanical way, assomething that
happens tothecirculatory system, and thevarious
subsequent discoveries about treating shock have
seemed too mysterious ortoo implausible togain
general acceptance. Intheabsence ofaunifying
picture oftheorganism, treatments arelikely tobe
evaluated interms ofafragmented aspect ofthe
organism, and ifthey don't mechanically fitinto
that system inanobvious way, they aredismissed.
Ihave written previously about several dra-
matically effective treatments forshock that were
developed inthelast fifty years--for example, in-
travenous ATP, concentrated solutions ofsodium
cWoride orglucose, and themorphine/endorphin-
blocker, naloxone. Theoretical reasons have kept
some ofthese techniques from being used as
widely aswould beappropriate, butgradually the
success ofthemethods isforcing some people to
rethink their theories.
Asimple newer view oftheorganism's ,energy
isbeing deve10ped, and early acceptance ofthis
new view will make itpossible toapproach treat-
ment inaway that isboth integrated andspecific.
Although Crne and Selye were famous for
their studies oftheacute effects ofnoxious condi-
tions, both were interested inthelong-term, cumu-
lative effects. Crne was more explicit about the
general evolutionary implications of his
discoveries.
One oftheleast scientific aspects ofconventi-
ional "evolutionary thinfing" jsthethought that jf
anorganism has ordoes something, that thing_or
behavior must have "survival value. "People apply
evolutionary explanations inacarefree way, feel-
ingthat anexplanation without support is
better than leaving something unexplained.
Shock, inflammation, aging and death have
been proposed to"have survival value," be-
cause ofthis totalitarian view ofgenetics.
Couldn't itbethat organisms simply aren't perfect,
and that some things are just systematically
screwed up? That is,anorganism has acertain
strength, resistance, oradaptive capacity, butifit
finds itself inconditions that aretoodifficult, then
processes that never didanything toaidsurvival
might develop, asseveral individually valid defen-
sive maneuvers 'start tointerfere with each other.
"Advance" and "retreat," eatand expel, forexam-
ple, are- processes that have tobefunctionally
separated; ifcoordination islost, new but con-
fused processes 'WIll emerge. Onthecellular level,
excitotoxicity -isan example ofthe loss of
coordination.
In1950 Selye, and in1953, Rees, pointed out
thesimilarities ofestrogen's effects tothephysiol-
ogyofstress andshock. Hundreds ofstudies' have .
confirmed thedetails ofestrogen's actions onthe
circulatory system, respiration, and metabolism.
Since wehave thegenes needed formaking estro-
gen, itmight seem that there isreason toargue
that shock "has agenetic basis," butthemistake
occurs when that phraseology isextended toclaim
that "genes for(something which produces) shock
prove that shock has survival value." Estr.ogen's
survival value exists only inthecontext ofawhole
organism with multiple ways forlimiting estrogen's
destabilizing actions. Estrogen's harmful effects
occur when oursystems foropposing itfail.
Recently, fhere hasbeen adispute about the
reason forthe evolution ofmenstruation among
prjrnates. The argument began when Margie Pro-
fetproposed that itisananti-infective defense
mechanism, a"cleansing" procedurp. Culturally,
this strikes measprimarily areaction against the
archaic doctrine ofthe"unclean" menses, and sci-
entifically, itishard toimagine that opening blood
vessels andbathing themembranes inblood would
beana,nti-infective strategy; infact, infec,!ions
such asgonorrhea and cWamydia aremore likely
tooccur after menstruation, and blood isan'ex-
ceedingly good growth medium forgerrits. Her
response tothat observation was that thepreva-
lence ofdiseases such asAIDS, cholera, and tu-
berculosis "doesn't mean that theimmune system
didn't evolve tofight pathogens." Ithink sheis
wrong onboth issues, the reason forevolving
menstruation andthereason forevolving ourim-
mune system. *
Ifwecanseemenstruation asaside effect of
the adaptations we have for producing large
brains, without itsown special "menstruation
genes," weshould also beable toseea phenome-
non such asshock assomething which isnotbio-
logically souseful that we"evolved" itinthesense
ofselecting for"shock genes." (Stumbling isa
consequence ofwalking, and thebiological point
ofinterest isthewalking, notthestumbling; any
interest that stumbling has, isasa"boundary" of
theability towalk.)
Mypoint istosuggest that shock issimply'" a
negative thing, afailure ofprotective systems, a
biological screw-up resulting from thesame sortof
inadequacy ofresources that produces "excltotox-
icity." The fact that shock-like features can -be
seen inthehormonal effects ofestrogen, and in
the "normal" process ofaging, leads tothe
thought that the body which can control theef-
fects ofestrogen should also beable tocontrol
theshock reaction and theaging process, ifgiven
theappropriate kinds ofsupport. Estrogen cre-
ates abias toward cellular "excitotoxicity," since it
promotes excitation while limiting energy" produc-
tion Our body controls estrogen's effects by de-
creasing excitation while increasing efficient
energy productIOn.
The several effective methods of preventing
death from shock cangive usinsight into thisgen-
eral process ofthefailure oflife, and sointo the
nature oflifeitself.
The average biology professor isjust about as
unsophisticated asthe average television-viewer
about water inorganisms--how itgotthere, why it
stays there, what itdoes. The typical biologist
maintains the conventional view ofthe cell by
changing thesubject whenever afact conflicts ith
adoctrine. The history ofthe"cell membrane"
shows how thismental process hasworked.
Atfirst, an oily coat was thought toaccount
forthedifferent composition ofthe
tions around cells, and inside cells. Then mem-
brane pumps" were introduced toexplain e
differences, because toomany facts were inconsis-
tent with the simple membrane idea. Proteins
were found and identified asthepumps. Then it
turned outthat pumps would require energy that
cells couldn't (and needn't) provide, and many
ways were devised toexplain the minimal energy
needed tomaintain thecomposition ofcellwater.
But the "pump-proteins"--calcium-ATP-ase,
sodium/potassium ATPase, etc.-are proteins that
really exist, though their functions aremuch more
interesting than "pumping." Animportant context
forthinking about these ATPases isthat thecon-
tractile protein ofmuscle (myosin) isacalcium-
dependent ATPase.
The habit ofbiochemists hasbeen tothink of
enzymes asthesoluble proteins that could beex-
tracted from cells inawatery solution, andtoig-
nore theinsoluble residue, which contained the
ATPases. Now, much oftheresidue has'been res-
urrected for biochemistry, under the name of
"membrane proteins. The "ghost" ofthe red
blood cell, after ithasbeen shocked into losing its-
hemoglobin, isapopular labpreparation that bio-
chemists like tocall a"membrane," though the
term isgrossly misleading. Szent-Gyorgyi, Gilbert
Ling, and afew physically conscious biologists
spoke ofthese relatively insoluble proteins' as
structural proteins.
In1968 or'69,Ihadbeen reading theprevious'
50years ofresearch oncellphysiology, andIsaw
that for 20 years, Gilbert Ling had been almost
alone inoffering aview ofthecellthat was physi-
cally possible. Hehad solved theproblems of
.ionic regulation inways that physical chemists
could accept, butbiologists were proceeding asif
hissolutions totheir problems didn't exist. Iwrote·
tohim, toseeifI,asanewcomer to"science,"
was missing something. Hesaid that Ijust didn't
understand what "science" was; itwas amatter of
money, prestige, andinfluence, with little concern
forwhat was true.
Ithas been calculated that the substances
which aredistributed unequally between cells and
thesurrounding fluid would require 15times as 
much energy asthecells canproduce, iftheir dis- 
tribution hadtobemaintained bypumps, butithas 
also been demonstrated that cells can remain al- 
most atequilibrium, when their energy production 
iscompletely blocked bypoisons. Something 
maintains the ions and other solutes intheir 
unequal distribution between the inside and 
outside ofthecell, but itdoesn't take energy to 
do This iswhy cells have been compared to.
ion-exchange resins, which also have theability 
topassively select certain ions while excluding 
others. People who have examined theatom-by- 
atom physics ofhow anion-pump illight work 
have demonstrated thesilliness oftheidea. Ion- 
exchange granules selectively bind certain ions that 
reach them bypassive diffusion, and similar near- 
equilibrium processes canaccount fortheiongra-
dients maintained bycells. The interesting differ-
ence incells (compared toion-exchange resins) is
that their physical near-equilibrium isclosely bal-
anced with chemical processes, which are also
much closer toequilibrium than conventional
schemes imagine.
thesilliness ofthe"pump". idea
demystifies themembrane idea, andthen aperson
canbegin tothink about how cells really work.
-r Stimulated, active cells expend energy. Be-
!sides doing measurable work, such ascontraction, ,
they release ameasurable amount ofheat, atthe
moment of responding to stimulation.
Surprisingly, stimulated nerves have been observed
toabsorb heat immediately after releasing it;iIia
"refiigerator-like" process thatcoincides with their
electri,cal repolarization. Noone was able toex-
plain this onthebasis ofmembranes and pumps,
since thepumps should bereleasing their heataf-.
terstimulation and during repolarization.
Ihave thought ofthis interms ofKelvin's idea
ofincreased surface area leading todecreased tem-
_perature ..What we.
theway energy canbeused inree'stablishing the
cell's resting condition. without releasing heat,
might bethe idea that physical processes (the
change ofprotein conformation and water struc-
ture) are intimately integrated with chemical
equilibria.
Around 1970, afamous English researcher was
inEugene lecturing about his'theory that thefa-
mous "high energy bond ofATP" (14kcal, Ithink
hesaid) could beused toexplain muscle contrac-
tion. Ihadjust read anoldpaper byoneofmy
professors, Sidney which showed that
itsbond energy wasn't nearly sohigh. When I
asked Bernhard why "everyone talks about ATP's
high-energy bond," hejustsaid "everyone doesn't."
When ATP breaks down itabsorbs water, and
when itissynthesized, water isreleased. Ina
water-free environnient, theequilibrium favors the
formation ofATP. The chemical activity ofwater
incells islower than itisinordimL'-y water. Given
theright (anhydrous) environment, ATP willform
spontaneously. Asthereactants form ATP and
give upwater, energy is(atleast theoretically) ab-
sorbed bythechemical bond. Intheabstract, this
shows that theformation ofATP andtheabsorp-
tionofenergy could becaused byfactors that con-
trol the activity oravailability ofwater. The
protein-ATP complex isone ofthose water-
regulating factors.
The abstract idea that ATP could beformed
bya'-"relaxlng" cell (re'covering
from stimulation) goes against theidea that a"cell ..
isamotor and ATP isthefuel." Some people
have argued thatthecontraction occurs first, caus-
ingATP tobesplit, rather than thereverse. Other
examples ofenzyme activation support thisview,
that the contraction oractivation isaphysical
process, likereleasing aspring. Inthecontracted·,
or activated state, sodium isable toenter thecell
momentarily, andthepresence ofsodium seems to
allow theATP tobereformed. These differences
might seem subtle, but they have made anall-
or-none difference intheminds ofmedical peo-
ple deciding ontherapies and diets.
This picture ofacellasaloaded spring, oras

softener, isthesortofimage Ihave' inmind when I
speak of"charging the .:
Several researchers have demonstrated thatin-
-ntravenous injections ofATP prevent death from
shock, that shock depletes theATP ofthecells,
..and that depleted cells absorb ATP much more
readily than normal cells that don't lack it.Allof
thebiologists andbiochemists (atOregon's Insti-
tute forMolecular Biology) that Imentioned this
tosaid itwas impossible, "because ATP ishighly
ionized andcan't cross thecellmembrane. "
Even when ageneral idea isclear andconsis-
tentwith thefacts, ifitopposes thedominant view
itneeds some experiments that canhardly beun-
derstood without it.
\' Liver ATPisincreased asaresult ofin-
Lcreasing blood sodium. Anincrease ofonly
about 15% intheblood sodium, forexample,
caused thecells' ATP tonearly double. [R. L.
Veech, etal.,"Relationship offree cytoplasmic py-
rophosphate toliver glucose content andtotal py-
rophosphate to cytoplasmic phosphorylation
potential," FEBS Lett. 117, K65-72, 1980.]
Sodium isan"extracellular" ion,onethatbinds
water toitseif sostrongly that itisexcluded from
thecellunder normai co.nditions, inwhich thewa-
ter isdominated bythecell's structural molecules.
Itisonly when thecellisstimulated orfatigued
that itabsorbs larger amounts ofsodium, andthe
fatigued cellalso absorbs anexcess ofwater. The
textbooks say "water follows sodium," butthe
physical reality isthat sodium also follows (free)
water, andthat ittends tobeexcluded from the
water ofcells. Increasing thesodium intheen-
vironment ofawater-logged cell will tend to
dehydrate thecell.
This experiment, using sodium toincrease
ATP (especially when weremember that ATP is
aneffective treatment for shock) shows how
hypertonic sodium might rescue ashock victim, in-
creasing circulatory efficiency, helping toincrease
bloogvolume, restoring thecell's electrical and
chemical resting state, andpossibly regulating in-
tracellular pH. [G..B.Haycock, "The influence of
sodium ongrowth ininfancy," Pediatr. Nephrol.
7(6), 871-875, 1993.] The increasing blood vol-
ume isa"mechanical" effect thathelps tomake the
useofhypertonic sodium culturally more accept-
able, butitisreally secondary totheother effects .
ofsodium. The first water toberestored tothe
serum isthat contained inredblood cells andthe
swollen endothelium. Capillaries and small blood
vessels that have been obstmcted byswollen en-
dotheiial cells aliow free passage ofthe blood,
and theincreased water lowers theblood's viscos-
ity, improving itsability todeliver oxygen and
glucose. Brain swelling isreduced, andconscious-
ness isrestored. Glucose metabolism isalso im-
proved under these conditions. .
Sodium causes theATPase toproduce ATP,
rather than consuming it.(p.I. Garrahan and 1.
M.Glynn, "The incorporation ofinorganic phos-
phate into adenosine triphosphate byreversal of
the sodium pump," I. Physiol. 192, 237-256,
1967.; P.A.Dibrov, etal.,"Astudy onNa+-
coupled oxidative phosphorylation: ATP fO,rma-
tion supported byartificially imposed delta pNa
anddelta' pKinVibrio alginolyticus cells," 1.Bio-
energ. Biomembr. 21(3),347-357, 1989.)
The membrane-pump theory says that thecell
consumes ATP toexpel thesodium which enters,
andincreased external sodium increases itslikeli-
hood ofentering thecell, butinrealiry increased
external sodium causes more ATP tobeproduced.
The precise balance ofions seems tomake the
difference between consumption orproduction
ofATP. [t.Plesner, etal.,"[32P]ATP synthesis in
steady state from [32P]Pi andADP byNa+/K +-
ATPase from oxbrain andpigkidney. Activation
by K+," Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1040(2),
167-174, 1990.]
Remembering that themuscle protein isan
ATPase, there isasituation that Ithink isanalo-
gous. When amuscle isstretched, itforms ATP, .
rather than consuming it.This could betheres4lt
ofaslight change inthephysical state ofthewater
andsmall changes inchemical affinities produced[
bythechanges inprotein conformation. Before
thiseffect ofstretch onATPsynthesis was directly
observed, Starling's law oftheheart recognized
that jtheforce ofcontraction increased with theini-
tiallength ofthemuscle fiber. Simply increasing
blood volume increases the effectiveness ofthe
heart contraction. Szent-Gyorgyi described are-
'lated process (the "staircase" phenomenon) as
"function building structure, structure producing
function. " ..
Sodium isrequired forcells toabsorb glucose
andamino acids. Ihave recommended salty foods
atbedtime topromote sleep, because ofsodium's
recognized anti-adrenalin effect. There are some
complicated ways ofthinking about itseffect on
adrenalin, asthere are for explaining itsther-
mogenic effect, butthesimple fact that itisneeded
forabsorbing glucose can explain itsability to
lower adrenalin (since adrenalin rises when glu-
cose isneeded) andtoincrease heat production.
Inthe fetus and the newborn baby, sodium
promotes growth ..Progesterone, sodium andglu-
cose areoften limiting factors inthegrowth ofthe
baby's b'rain; they aredeficient, cells diein-
stead ofgrowing.
The fact isthat sodium energizes. Ithelps to
remove calcium from the cell, (0produce ATP,
and topromote absorption ofglucose and amino
acids. The fear many physicians have ofinjecting
hypertonic sodium chloride isodd, inthelight of
theknowledge that hasaccumulated inrecent dec-
ades. Chloride isn't always theideal anion, but
more elaborate preparation isneeded forproviding
theideal ionic solution.
Carbon dioxide ispowerfully involved inthe
regulation ofboth sodium and calcium, aswell as
inrespiration andenergy production. .
Ittends torelax both nerves andmuscles. Itis
apparently oneoftheessential factors inprevent-
ingedema. [For example, inthecornea; M.V.
Riley, etal.,1995.]
ATP andC02 both bind tohemoglobin, regu-
lating itsaffinity foroxygen. The way inwhich
they bii:Id tothis protein indicates that they Will
bind tomany other intracellular proteins, similarly
regulating thefunctions ofthose proteins.
The elimination ofwater from theenvirOliment
inwhich ATPisformed ordecomposed favors its
formation, and inthis environment ATP doesn't
contain itsreputed "high energy bonds," butitstill
hasitsstrong affinity forbinding toproteins. So-
dium binds water toitself, anditisthisfeature that
leads toitsexclusion from thenormal cell. C02,
when itisinwater, especially with thecarbonic
anhydrase enzymes, combines with water. Asitis
formed inthemitochondria, thismeans that itwill
carry water (aswell ascalcium and sodium) out
intothecytoplasm, andoutofthecell.
Inmany situations, including brain hypoxia,
carbon dioxide isthedecisive protective factor.
Low thyroid function involves reduced forma-
tion ofcarbon dioxide, and thebody fluids don't
retain asmuch sodium asinnormal individuals.
Both urine and sweat tend tocontain abnormally
high sodium concentration inhypothyroidism. Be-
cause C02 iscentral totheregulation ofpH, and
hydrogen ionexcretion (acid urine) isoriemecha-
nism involved insodium retention, theC02 defi-
ciency ofhypothyroidism isprobably closely
connected with the inability toretain adequate
sodium.
The body fluids are actually hypotonic in
hypothyroidism.
Ifhypertonic sodium energizes, then thelow-
sodium hypoosmotic fluids ofhypothyroidism
de-energize.
Low-thyroid cells are also unable toretain
magnesium efficiently, andamagnesium deficiency
prevents muscle relaxation, wasting energy. Ade-
quate sodium prevents urinary magnesium loss.
Hypothyroidism tends tocause hypoglycemia,
and thelack ofglucose (even ifitisbecause the
glucose intheblood can't beabsorbed because of
insufficient sodium) causes elevation ofadrenalin.
Hypertonic sodium given intravenously lowers the
amount ofadrenalin intheblood, just as'thethy-
roid hormone does.
Hypothyroidism also causes animbalance be-
tween theantiestrogenic antishock hormones, pro-
gesterone and pregnenolone, and proshock
estrogen.
The close integration ofphysical andchemical
processes when those processes are near
equilibrium isthefactortheprinciple thatislack-
inginthedoctrine thecellislikeacollection
ofmotors, fueled byATP. Ifyou canimagine a
Chevrolet that attimes creates gasoline while ab-
sorbing heat, then thesimile would beacceptable.
Theinappropriateness ofthemental image ofacell
with pumps andmotors leads tothetreatment of
shock with things thatproduce shock, ofheart fail-
urewith things that produce heart failure, andof
aging with things thataccelerate aging.

NOTE: *The estrogen dominance which is
needed tostart thereproductive cycle, with cellprolif-
eration intheendometrium, breast, andpituitary, isnot
otherwise useful totheorganism, andiscontrolled and
opposed during pregnancy byaconstantly rising pro-
duction ofprogesterone. The state ofestrogen domi-
nance isessentially unstable. P.T. Ellison,
emphasizing the"energy hungry brains" ofprimates,
explains theneed forthemassive endometrial groWth in
primates, and Strassman observes that endometrial re-
gression occurs inallrnanunals. These areimportant
points. Their failure topoint outthat estrogen has
many undesirable systemic effects very likely results
from thecultural context that hasbeen created bythe
estrogen-promoting pharmaceutical industry.
The group ofprocesses that wecall theimmune
system issodeeply integrated with evefYthing else in
theorganism thattotalk about ''the reason forevolving
it"isasmisleading astotalk about ''the reason" for
evolving certain pigmentations-black feathers, forex-
ample, aremechanically stronger than white ones, se-
lection offoxes for domesticability changes their fur
pigmentation and their voice, selection foregglaying
somehow suppression offeather pigmenta-
tion, etc., yetpeople liketotalk about protective col-
oration, because aneasy conn.ection can bemade
between that andgenetic selection. Being anorganism
isaproblem whose solution may require inventive use
ofinternal andexternal resources; chromosomes arein-
ternal resources, notclusters oftraits.
The ideology that sees theorganism asasum of
traits, each with itsgene, hasbeen afailure inprovid-
ingunderstanding about how anorganism comes to
exist.
